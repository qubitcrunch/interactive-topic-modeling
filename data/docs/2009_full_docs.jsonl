{"date": "Wed, 08 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JOHANNESBURG \u2014 Thousands of South African construction workers walked off their jobs on Wednesday, beginning a nationwide strike that could threaten the biggest event in international soccer, the 2010 World Cup.\nHowever important the tournament may be to fans of the game, it represents nothing less than a defining moment for South Africa, the first country on the continent selected to host such a major sports competition.\nWork on 10 stadiums \u2014 five new ones and five under renovation \u2014 is supposed to be complete by December, well in advance of the games to be played next June. This nation\u2019s self-esteem is on the line, with $75 billion in building projects under way, including upgrades to airports and highways.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all proud to be working on a World Cup site, but pride does not fill your family\u2019s stomach,\u201d said Martin Baloyi, a 42-year-old laborer who laid aside his tools Wednesday afternoon at Soccer City, the behemoth of a stadium here in Johannesburg where the finals are scheduled to be played.\nFor several months, two unions representing 70,000 construction workers have been negotiating a revised deal with a consortium of employers known as the South African Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors. Most of the laborers earn about $1.75 an hour, and the unions are asking for an increase of 13 percent.\nThe companies have countered with a 10.4 percent offer, while publicly complaining that union demands include a costly set of enhanced benefits, like a meal allowance, payment for days lost because of bad weather and four months\u2019 maternity leave.\n\u201cThis package all adds up to a 50 percent increase in costs, and on top of that is the 13 percent in wages, so you are looking at 63 or 65 percent extra, and that\u2019s way too much,\u201d said Joe Campanella, a spokesman for the consortium.\nA lengthy strike would not only embarrass South Africans as their country primps for an event expected to draw 450,000 visitors, but would also be a huge failure for the new government. Jacob Zuma ascended to the presidency with a mighty boost from the trade unions. The extent of his assistance to labor now will be seen as a measure of payback for that support.\nPresident Zuma is in Italy attending the Group of 8 summit meeting, which includes leaders from some developing nations. But his labor minister has called for an urgent meeting on Thursday, bringing together chief executives of the biggest companies involved, civic overseers of the World Cup and leaders of the two unions, the National Union of Mineworkers and the Building Construction and Allied Workers Union.\n\u201cBottom line, I think they\u2019ll come up with some agreement sooner rather than later,\u201d said Udesh Pillay, head of a research project tracking South Africa\u2019s preparations for next year\u2019s World Cup, a 32-team tournament.\nMr. Campanella, the spokesman for the construction companies, said: \u201cIf a strike goes on for a month, we\u2019re in trouble. If it goes on a couple of days, maybe not.\u201d\nThe workers, of course, have a powerful hammer in any job action that threatens the World Cup. Bhekani Ngcobo, a union negotiator, said the strike would go on until all demands were met, \u201ceven if that comes in 2011.\u201d The labor stoppage also includes work on the Gautrain, a rail link between Johannesburg and Pretoria, scheduled for completion next year.\nBut there is no strike fund, and very few of the construction workers have enough savings to forfeit a payday. \u201cSome of us can afford to stay out two days, some not even that,\u201d said a concrete handler, Richard Bizela. \u201cThe landlord doesn\u2019t care about strikes. He just wants his money.\u201d\nThough South Africa boasts the continent\u2019s biggest economy, its unemployment rate recently shot up to 23.5 percent, and tens of thousands of union jobs have been lost to the global recession.\nUnions have been agitating for more state intervention in the economy, pushing for an ambitious industrial policy that might generate jobs. The Congress of South African Trade Unions, or Cosatu, is part of Mr. Zuma\u2019s governing alliance. Nevertheless, its leader, Zwelinzima Vavi, has warned that delays in pay increases for government workers \u201ccould unleash explosive spates of uncontrollable labor unrest.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Cosatu issued a statement saying its members were \u201c100 percent behind their comrades in the construction sector,\u201d arguing that a strike for a 13 percent pay increase was justifiable in view of rising food prices and a 31.3 percent rise in electricity rates that went into effect last week.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/africa/09safrica.html", "title": "World Cup in Africa Stumbles Over Strike", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}

{"date": "Mon, 14 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The senior allied operational commander in Afghanistan warned Monday that the military faced stiff challenges to deploying 30,000 additional American troops here on the tight schedule that President Obama has ordered.\nThe officer, Lt. Gen. David M. Rodriguez, the deputy commander of American and NATO forces here, said that bad weather, limited capacity to send supplies by air and potential attacks on ground convoys carrying equipment for the troops from Pakistan and other neighboring countries presented formidable hurdles to meeting the goal of sending all of the reinforcements by next fall.\nUnder Mr. Obama\u2019s order early this month to accelerate the troop deployments, the White House initially said the additional forces would be in place within six months. Pentagon officials quickly amended that to say the bulk of the forces would be on the ground by next summer, but it would take a few months after that before all troops were in place.\nGeneral Rodriguez did not back away from that timeline, saying that all of the additional troops would be in Afghanistan within 9 t0 11 months. But he spoke in some of the bluntest terms yet about the difficulties in achieving that goal. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of risks in here, but we\u2019re going to try to get them in as fast as we can,\u201d he said in an interview at his heavily fortified headquarters. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that have to line up perfectly.\u201d\nA central tenet of Mr. Obama\u2019s revised strategy for Afghanistan is to knock the Taliban on their heels with a wave of American forces, providing security and buying time for the Afghan Army and the national police to train and take over security duties.\nUnderscoring General Rodriguez\u2019s concern, bad weather here last week grounded Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates for two days, preventing him from flying to visit several military outposts in remote parts of the country.\nGeneral Rodriguez spoke to reporters who were traveling with Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who arrived here on Monday to confer with American military commanders and senior Afghan officials, as the first of thousands of reinforcements bound for Taliban-controlled southern Afghanistan arrive later this week.\nIn a news conference here, Admiral Mullen restated the American goal of working closely with the government of President Hamid Karzai to wrest control of Taliban-controlled territory, particularly in Afghanistan\u2019s south and east.\nHe acknowledged that the timing of the troop deployment has decreased the time American forces scheduled to deploy here will have to prepare for their assignments, particularly troops that had been initially ordered to go to Iraq and were readying for duty there.\nAdmiral Mullen, who is scheduled to visit many of the outposts Mr. Gates could not, said American forces at Camp Lejeune, N.C., Fort Campbell, Ky., and other installations sending troops here should \u201clearn all they can\u201d about Afghan culture, language and customs to be more effective in their counterinsurgency mission.\n\u201cWe must protect the Afghan people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must put their lasting security first. They must know and must feel safe.\u201d\nAdmiral Mullen also met on Monday with Mr. Karzai, as well as the government\u2019s defense and interior ministers, to discuss the training of Afghan security forces. He said he underscored to the Afghan leaders the importance of quality, not just quantity, in producing competent soldiers and police.\nLast week, Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the American commander in charge of training the Afghan security forces, acknowledged the serious difficulties ahead in the training program under which the United States hopes to increase in size and efficiency the Afghan Army and the police \u2014 to as many as 282,000 people from nearly 192,000 \u2014 before Mr. Obama\u2019s goal of beginning to withdraw American troops in July 2011.\nAdmiral Mullen said that during his weeklong swing through Central Asia, he would stop in Pakistan and meet with Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani Army chief of staff. It will be Admiral Mullen\u2019s 14th meeting with General Kayani since becoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\nThe United States has praised the Pakistani Army for its recent offensive in the mountainous border area of South Waziristan. But American officials have pressed Pakistan\u2019s civilian and military leaders to take aggressive action against two groups that use Pakistan as a haven from which to attack allied forces in Afghanistan \u2014 the Haqqani network and the leadership of the Afghan Taliban, who are believed to operate from the southern city of Quetta.\nThe Pakistani military has rebuffed the American pressure to go after the Haqqani network, whose fighters pose the biggest threat to American forces, Pakistani military officials said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/world/asia/15mullen.html", "title": "Military Faces Challenges in Deploying More Troops to Afghanistan", "author": "ERIC SCHMITT"}

The parliamentary elections here in June are shaping up to be among the most expensive ever held anywhere, with hundreds of millions of dollars streaming into this small country from around the globe.\nLebanon has long been seen as a battleground for regional influence, and now, with no more foreign armies on the ground, Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region are arming their allies here with campaign money in place of weapons. The result is a race that is widely seen as the freest and most competitive to be held here in decades, with a record number of candidates taking part. But it may also be the most corrupt.\nVotes are being bought with cash or in-kind services. Candidates pay their competitors huge sums to withdraw. The price of favorable TV news coverage is rising, and thousands of expatriate Lebanese are being flown home, free, to vote in contested districts. The payments, according to voters, election monitors and various past and current candidates interviewed for this article, nurture a deep popular cynicism about politics in Lebanon, which is nominally perhaps the most democratic Arab state but in practice is largely governed through patronage and sectarian and clan loyalty.\nDespite the vast amounts being spent, many Lebanese see the race \u2014 which pits Hezbollah and its allies against a fractious coalition of more West-friendly political groups \u2014 as almost irrelevant. Lebanon\u2019s sectarian political structure virtually guarantees a continuation of the current \u201cnational unity\u201d government, in which the winning coalition in the 128-seat Parliament grants the loser veto powers to preserve civil peace.\nStill, even a narrow win by Hezbollah and its allies, now in the parliamentary opposition, would be seen as a victory for Iran \u2014 which has financed Hezbollah for decades \u2014 and a blow to American allies in the region, especially Saudi Arabia and Egypt. So the money flows.\n\u201cWe are putting a lot into this,\u201d said one adviser to the Saudi government, who added that the Saudi contribution was likely to reach hundreds of millions of dollars in a country of only four million people. \u201cWe\u2019re supporting candidates running against Hezbollah, and we\u2019re going to make Iran feel the pressure.\u201d\nAs it happens, Lebanon has campaign spending limits this year for the first time, and the Arab world\u2019s first system to monitor that spending, by the Lebanese chapter of Transparency International. But the limits \u2014 which are very loose to begin with \u2014 apply only in the last two months of the campaign. And they are laughably easy to circumvent, according to election monitors and Lebanese officials.\nReformers have tried and failed to introduce a uniform national ballot, which could reduce the influence of money and make the system less vulnerable to fraud. Currently, political parties or coalitions usually print up their own distinctive ballots and hand them to voters before they walk into the booth, making it easier to be sure they are getting the votes they have paid for.\nSome voters, especially in competitive districts, receive cold calls offering cash for their vote. But mostly the political machines work through local patriarchs known as \u201celectoral keys,\u201d who can deliver the votes of an entire clan in exchange for money or services \u2014 scholarships, a hospital, repaved roads and so on.\nIn a country where the average public school teacher earns less than $700 a month, these payments are a significant source of support for many communities. And because each seat in the Lebanese Parliament is designated by religious sect, the elections tend to reinforce the essentially feudal power structure of Lebanon, with a network of men from known families providing for each sect and region.\nAll the major political groups deny buying votes, which is illegal under Lebanese law, but election monitors acknowledge that it is a routine practice. \u201cSince the 1990s, more money has been coming in,\u201d said Paul Salem, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center here. \u201cUnfortunately, the system adjusts to that and in a way comes to expect it, especially among the poor.\u201d\nIn fact, many poorer Lebanese look to the elections as a kind of Christmas, when cash, health-care vouchers, meals and other handouts are abundant.\nThe largess extends across the globe. From Brazil to Australia, thousands of expatriates are being offered free plane trips back home to vote. Saad Hariri, the billionaire leader of the current parliamentary majority and a Saudi ally, is reputed to be the biggest election spender. It may not have helped that he kicked off his campaign with a gaudy televised event that resembled the set of \u201cWho Wants to Be a Millionaire.\u201d But members of his movement say that the accusation is unfair, and that their own money is outmatched by the hundreds of millions of dollars Iran has given to Hezbollah over the years.\nCandidates and political parties generally will not admit to receiving money from abroad.\nOne of them, however, recently broke with convention by acknowledging it openly. Ahmed al-Asaad, 46, said that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government was a \u201csignificant source of support\u201d for his campaign against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. He said his goal was to pull the Shiites of Lebanon away from Iran.\n\u201cI need tools to fight back, and if the Saudis have an interest in building a state here, why shouldn\u2019t I take advantage of that?\u201d said Mr. Asaad, an American-educated businessman, during an interview at his office just outside Beirut.\nCandidates who do not ally themselves with a powerful patronage machine are almost unheard of here.\nWalid Maalouf, a banker who worked briefly as a diplomat while living in the United States, is running an independent campaign on a shoestring budget, barnstorming from town to town in his mountain district. He says most people in the villages tell him he is the only politician who bothers to visit them. They are grateful, but he does not offer cash or patronage, and they are unsure what to think of him.\nRecently, Mr. Maalouf said, he was trying to explain to a village leader that he should think of candidates as employees, not patrons \u2014 someone they would hire to represent them effectively in the government.\n\u201cHe looked at me,\u201d Mr. Maalouf recalled, \u201cand then he said, \u2018Go back to America.\u2019 \u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/world/middleeast/23lebanon.html", "title": "Foreign Money Seeks to Buy Lebanese Votes", "author": "ROBERT F.

Web sites with links to the torture tape have been blocked in the Emirates, in violation of the Emirates\u2019 own policies. No local news media reported on it until the Abu Dhabi government issued a short statement on Wednesday condemning the acts shown on the video.\nStill, outrage has been quietly growing among citizens of the Emirates, where the prestige of the ruling family is important to political stability.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve put a lot of political capital into this nuclear deal; they have to push it through,\u201d said Christopher M. Davidson, a scholar who has written extensively on the Emirates. \u201cBut to do so, they may have to sacrifice one of their own, and that will damage the myth of the ruling family.\u201d\nThe videotape, made in 2004, emerged in a separate lawsuit filed by Bassam Nabulsi, a former business partner of Sheik Issa. Mr. Nabulsi, an American citizen from Houston, claims he was later tortured by Emirates police officers after he refused to hand over the videotape.\nThe tape was made by Mr. Nabulsi\u2019s brother on orders from Sheik Issa, who liked to film torture sessions and watch them later in his palace, said Anthony G. Buzbee, Mr. Nabulsi\u2019s lawyer.\nIn its statement, the government of Abu Dhabi \u2014 the emirate to whose ruling family Sheik Issa belongs \u2014 promised a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of the matter. It also said the government \u201cunderstands that the matter depicted on the video was resolved between the two parties and that no criminal charges were brought by either party.\u201d\nThe man being tortured in the video is Mohammed Shah Poor, an Afghan grain merchant who Sheik Issa believed had cheated him, Mr. Buzbee said. Mr. Poor was gravely injured but survived, Mr. Buzbee said.\nABC News reported that the Abu Dhabi authorities had acknowledged Sheik Issa\u2019s role in the torture, and that they had said it was \u201cnot part of a pattern of behavior.\u201d\nA spokesman for the Abu Dhabi government declined to comment, and sent a text message saying, \u201cAll we have is now public knowledge.\u201d\nMr. Buzbee says he has two additional videos showing Sheik Issa torturing other men, including Sudanese immigrants. In those tapes, 15 to 20 Abu Dhabi police officers can be seen assisting in the torture, he says.\n\u201cThese videotapes capture behavior that went on for some time and was well known to Sheik Issa\u2019s brothers,\u201d who include the president, interior minister and foreign minister of the Emirates as well as other high-ranking officials, Mr. Buzbee said. Sheik Issa does not hold a government position.\nDaryl Bristow, Sheik Issa\u2019s lawyer, said in a statement that \u201cBassam Nabulsi and his lawyer are attempting to use a videotape of a third party to influence the court and public opinion\u201d about the lawsuit. He added that he could not comment on details because of the suit, but that \u201cwhen all the facts are known, the one-sided \u2018story\u2019 being told by Nabulsi and his lawyer will be completely addressed and Nabulsi will be discredited.\u201d\nLast year, another member of the ruling family, Falah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, was convicted by a Swiss court of beating an American man with a belt in a Geneva hotel bar in 2003. He has appealed that verdict.\nUnder the pending nuclear agreement, the United States would share expertise, technology and fuel in exchange for a promise by the Emirates to abide by international safeguards and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The United States has already signed agreements with India, Egypt and Morocco, and is planning nuclear pacts with other states in the Middle East even as it leads efforts to stop Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nSome American lawmakers have concerns about the deal, saying Dubai \u2014 one of the seven parts in the Emirates federation \u2014 has been used as a transit point for technology bound for Iran. The torture video could add to those reservations.\n\u201cHow can we move forward with such a delicate agreement in the face of such an atrocious human rights violation?\u201d said Representative James P. McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, the co-chairman of the House Human Rights Commission. \u201cIf it were brought to Congress now, I would certainly ask that it be rejected.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/world/middleeast/02emirates.html", "title": "Videotape Complicates U.S. Deal With Emirates", "author": "ROBERT F.

United Nations officials in Nairobi later released a statement confirming the abductions but offering no additional details.\nThe identity of the three foreigners was not immediately known, and no group claimed responsibility.\nSomalia is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for foreigners, who become prime kidnapping targets for gunmen seeking ransoms of millions of dollars. Dozen of foreigners, including journalists and aid workers, have been abducted since last year. Some have been held for months, like two journalists seized last August. Much like the pirates who hold ships and crews for ransoms off Somalia\u2019s eastern coast, the kidnappers generally release the foreigners unharmed once ransoms are paid.\nThe hard-line Islamist group the Shabab, which controls Wajid, did not release a statement regarding the kidnapping. The group, which is designated by the United States as a terrorist organization, controls wide swaths of southern Somalia, where it has introduced a strict version of Islamic law.\nThere is frequent fighting between the Shabab and moderate Islamist militias in Mogadishu, the capital, and other areas. At least 18 people were killed in clashes that started Saturday afternoon some 180 miles north of Mogadishu, and thousands of civilians fled the Wabho and Dac districts, according to witness accounts. The region is an incredibly arid land affected by severe droughts that resulted from shortage of the seasonal rainfalls.\nThe kidnapping further complicates the highly dangerous business of delivering aid in Somalia. Across the nation, the United Nations estimates that some 3.2 million people, or about 30 percent of the population, are in need of assistance.\nSomalia has been without a functioning central government since 1991, when Gen. Mohammed Siad Barre was removed from power and the army fell into the hands of clan militias, who turned on one another and left the country largely in chaos.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/world/africa/17somalia.html", "title": "4 Aid Workers Abducted in Somalia", "author": "MOHAMMED IBRAHIM"}
{"date": "Thu, 03 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 In a devastating blow to Somalia\u2019s fragile transitional government, a suicide bomber disguised as a veiled woman blew himself up at a college graduation ceremony in the capital on Thursday, killing at least 15 people, including 3 government ministers, Somali officials said.\nThe attack killed more high-ranking Somali officials than any before it, illustrating how weak the government really is. The fact that the government cannot protect even its own could further undermine the support it needs, especially within the country. The killings may also increase the urgency for the government, which has several thousand young soldiers in training, to go on the offensive before it is too late.\nThe bomber struck in a part of Mogadishu, Somalia\u2019s capital, that was thought be relatively safe, though many Somalis fear Islamic insurgents have infiltrated the government\u2019s security forces all across the city.\nThe insurgents seem to have the ability to strike at will, as they did in September when they attacked a heavily fortified African Union peacekeeping base, killing more than a dozen peacekeepers.\nThough no one has claimed responsibility yet for the attack on Thursday, it had all the earmarks of the Shabab, an extremist Islamist group in Somalia that is drawing increasingly close to Al Qaeda and harbors the ambition not only to rule Somalia, but also to foment a holy war across Africa. The Shabab have drawn jihadist fighters from around the world, including the United States, where officials believe several dozen Somali-Americans have left to fight in Somalia.\nAccording to witnesses and government officials, dozens of medical students gathered around 11 a.m. at the Shamo Hotel to mark a hard-fought milestone \u2014 their college graduation, no small feat in a country that has been mired in chaos for nearly 20 years.\nThe Shamo Hotel is in the tiny enclave of Mogadishu that the government controls. The rest is under the grip of the Shabab or other extremist Islamist groups that have sawed off the hands of teenage thieves and even recently banned bras (Shabab fighters said bras were un-Islamic). The Shamo was considered one of the safest hotels and the base of choice for the few Westerners willing to risk a visit to the bullet-pocked city.\nSeveral high-ranking government officials, including the ministers of health, education and higher education, were sitting in plastic chairs in a conference hall decorated with streamers, watching the students graduate, when the bomber, dressed in a thick black veil, detonated his explosives, witnesses said.\nThe three ministers were killed, along with two Somali journalists, the dean of Mogadishu\u2019s medical school and more than 10 students. Dozens were gravely injured, including three other doctors in a city that is desperately short of them.\nThe killings prove that the insurgents \u201ccan easily go at the heart of the system,\u201d said Mohamed Osman Aden, a Somali diplomat in Nairobi, who added: \u201cThis will create a lot of panic for all the supporters of the government.\u201d\nBoth sides, the insurgents and the government, seem to be in a race against time.\nThe Shabab may be militarily tough, but they are not popular. While the Shabab and their allies control about two-thirds of the country, many Somalis have been increasingly chafing against their harsh form of Islam.\nBut the clock is ticking for Somalia\u2019s transitional government. It currently controls only a few city blocks in a country the size of Texas, and has accomplished very little since a new, moderate Islamist president came into office in February and raised hopes for real change. Western countries, desperate to prevent Al Qaeda from securing a sanctuary in East Africa, see the transitional government as their last hope.\nThe United States has been pouring in millions of dollars in weapons for the government, though because of rampant defections, many of those guns immediately fell into Shabab hands, Somali officials have conceded. Other Western countries are helping to pay for the training of thousands of young Somalis to become the backbone of the new army. A government offensive was planned for this winter, but many people doubt it will make any difference.\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have a clue, doesn\u2019t have a plan, doesn\u2019t have anything,\u201d said one adviser to the United Nations operations in Somalia.\nThe adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of his position, said that the government was planning a major cabinet reshuffle, but that it was futile. \u201cIt\u2019s like rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic,\u201d he said.\nSome of the government officials killed on Thursday were allied with the Shabab in 2006, when a grass-roots Islamist movement ruled most of Somalia.\nOne of them was Ibrahim Hassan Addou, the minister of higher education. Mr. Addou was a moderate Islamist who was skilled at weathering the vicissitudes of Somali politics. He was an American citizen of Somali descent who had spent years as an administrator at American University in Washington.\nMr. Addou said he had come back to help rebuild his country.

{"date": "Fri, 12 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 Responding vigorously to a recent North Korean nuclear test, the Security Council voted unanimously Friday on an enhanced package of sanctions that, among other things, calls upon United Nations members to inspect cargo vessels and airplanes suspected of carrying military mat\u00e9riel in or out of the country.\nThe sanctions in Resolution 1874 were considered tougher than previous versions largely because China and Russia, the closest thing North Korea has to friends, agreed to a mixture of financial and trade restrictions designed to choke off military development.\nAside from a mandatory ban on arms exports, however, the steps are recommendations rather than requirements, so the potential impact depends on the determination of member states. Both China and Russia pushed to dilute some of the mandatory sanctions sought by the West, Japan and South Korea, and the hesitancy about going too far in punishing North Korea was reflected in their statements.\n\u201cThe resolution not only demonstrates the firm opposition of the international community to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea nuclear test, but also sends a positive signal,\u201d said Zhang Yesui, the Chinese ambassador, noting that it encourages all parties to solve the problem through political and diplomatic means.\nBut many analysts and former diplomats question whether the new measures will have enough bite to break a cycle \u2014 North Korean threats and weapons tests, followed by American-led sanctions and short-lived deals \u2014 and persuade the North to give up its nuclear weapons and missile programs once and for all.\n\u201cSanctions won\u2019t bring North Korea to its knees,\u201d said Kim Keun-sik, a specialist on North Korea at Kyungnam University in Seoul. \u201cThe North knows this very well, from having lived with economic sanctions of one sort or another for the past 60 years.\u201d\nAlthough many of the measures in the resolution passed Friday have been included in previous ones at the United Nations, countries like China and Russia were reluctant to enforce them. That hesitation was based largely on concern about destabilizing North Korea and sending a flood of refugees across the border. Ultimately, a collapse in the North Korean government, and a possible reunification of the Koreas, could mean having a stronger American ally right on China\u2019s and Russia\u2019s border.\nMr. Zhang emphasized that \u201call parties should refrain from any words or deeds that may exacerbate the conflict.\u201d In particular, he said that no country should threaten the use of force when it came to inspecting cargoes, since that was not authorized by the resolution.\nDespite their caution, Beijing and Moscow have been alarmed by the North Koreans\u2019 recent tests of a nuclear bomb and ballistic missiles, said diplomats involved in the negotiations. \u201cTheir concern about it and indeed their anger about it is genuine,\u201d said one Western diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing the policies of another member state.\nIn addition, there was a sense that a message had to be sent to other countries like Iran, which has its own nuclear program and has been ignoring Security Council sanctions designed to persuade it to negotiate. The Libyan ambassador told the Security Council that similar actions should be taken against Israel.\nStill, the Chinese left themselves a loophole: allowing the North Koreans to continue to import small arms which they buy mostly from China, a Western diplomat noted.\nNorth Korea has generally taken a belligerent attitude to previous Security Council resolutions. There was some speculation that it might respond to the latest sanctions either by firing a missile that it has been preparing in recent days or by conducting another nuclear test.\n\u201cThere is reason to believe that they may respond in an irresponsible fashion to this,\u201d Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador, told reporters in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re going to focus on ensuring that implementation is fully achieved by us and others; that that bite is felt. And we\u2019re not going to get into a tit-for-tat reaction to every North Korean provocative act.\u201d\nSome analysts said that no threat was large enough to stop a regime that saw nuclear weapons as the key to its survival and that had endured decades of economic sanctions and hardships, including starvation, rather than capitulate to outside pressure.\n\u201cThese are people who didn\u2019t flinch even when two million of their own people died of hunger,\u201d said Lee Ji-sue, a North Korea specialist at Myongji University in Seoul.\nMost analysts agree that the most effective measures are those that concentrate on the lifestyle of North Korean leaders: financial sanctions aimed at ending all banking transactions related to North Korea\u2019s weapons trade, and halting most grants and loans. Legitimate trade and development financing was not sanctioned.\nThe nuclear test on May 25 followed a series of confrontational actions taken by the North, largely reversing every step it had taken to abandon its nuclear program in recent years. Resolution 1874 condemned that test and ordered a halt to all future tests and to building ballistic missiles. It also said the country should rejoin the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nThe compromise that was reached on weapons inspections requests that states inspect ships on the high seas. If the country where the ship is registered decided to reject an inspection in international waters, then the country would be required to direct the vessel to a nearby harbor for an inspection. If neither happened, the episode would be reported to the Security Council\u2019s sanctions committee. The resolution also requires states to stop all \u201cbunkering\u201d services, like refueling, for North Korean vessels.\nThe possible effect of inspections was hard to gauge. North Korea ships significant cargo on its own vessels, and would be likely to refuse any inspection, and the 34-article resolution does not authorize the use of force.\nThe United States will intensify efforts to collect intelligence on North Korean cargoes, Ms. Rice said, and share it as widely as possible to try to insure that inspections happen.\nBut critics and proponents alike agree that the linchpin in making sanctions work is China, North Korea\u2019s primary aid and trade partner. The two share an 850-mile border, and China\u2019s $2 billion annual trade with the North accounts for more than 40 percent of the North\u2019s entire external trade, according to South Korean government estimates.\n\u201cThe sanctions will have a bite, but I\u2019m not sure if it will be painful enough to change North Korean policy,\u201d said Wi Sung-lac, the Foreign Ministry\u2019s top negotiator with North Korea. \u201cWhat we need on top of the sanctions is a united approach by the key players to enforce them.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/world/asia/13nations.html", "title": "U.N.

{"date": "Wed, 28 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 At first, breaking the gender barrier in South America did not go smoothly for Michelle Bachelet.\nIn 2006, she had just captured the world\u2019s attention, becoming the first woman to be elected president of this deeply conservative country. And she had done it alone, without the famous husbands that had propelled other female presidents in Latin America.\nBut one month after taking office, Ms. Bachelet faced huge student demonstrations across the country. Her support fell further when a new public transportation system turned chaotic, leading critics to lampoon her with an image of her riding atop a city bus toward the edge of a cliff.\n\u201cThere was the distinct impression that she was not in control,\u201d said Marta Lagos, director of Market Opinion Research International, a polling company in Chile.\nBut with only five months until she leaves office, Ms. Bachelet is increasingly likely to be remembered as one of her country\u2019s most popular leaders. Polls this month show her public approval to be above 70 percent, and in recent weeks she has recorded the highest levels since Chile went from dictatorship to democracy in 1990.\nAnalysts and pollsters attribute her stunning turnaround to her handling of the economy during the global financial crisis and to her decision to save billions of dollars in revenues from copper sales during the last commodity boom. That aggressive saving gave the country money to spend on pension reform and Ms. Bachelet\u2019s ambitious program of social protections for women and children, despite the financial crisis.\nMs. Bachelet is among a handful of Latin American leaders, including President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil, whose handling of the crisis has strengthened their popularity. Both Brazil and Chile are now emerging from recession, with Chile\u2019s government saying the economy will grow by 5 percent next year.\nMs. Bachelet, a professed agnostic and single mother of three in a country that legalized divorce only five years ago, shattered the mold of traditional Chilean politicians in this Roman Catholic stronghold. At the start, she said, the political establishment tried to portray her as weak and disrespectful of the office of the president.\n\u201cIt was an important challenge in the first few years,\u201d Ms. Bachelet, 58, said in a recent interview, noting the way other powerful women had urged her to toughen up and \u201cscream and insult\u201d to be respected. \u201cI took a gamble,\u201d she added, \u201cto exercise leadership without losing my feminine nature.\u201d\nNow, with Chile\u2019s presidential election less than two months away and term limits preventing her from running again, rival candidates are scrambling to be photographed next to her, including some who initially criticized her for not spending the copper windfall during the boom.\nAs she took power, Ms. Bachelet introduced a cabinet of 20 ministers: 10 men and 10 women, a gender parity no previous Chilean president had tried.\nBut her administration quickly stumbled in April 2006, when more than 100,000 high school students demonstrated for improvements in public education. Her popularity falling, she replaced three ministers in July.\nThe following February, the introduction of the Transantiago public transportation system, designed by the administration of her predecessor, President Ricardo Lagos, turned into a major embarrassment when it proved confusing and could not satisfy demand.\nShe replaced five more ministers in March 2007, three of them women succeeded by men. By September, the outcry over Transantiago had pushed her approval rating down to 35 percent.\n\u201cI have said it was a mistake,\u201d Ms. Bachelet said. \u201cIt was a good idea, but it created problems for the day-to-day life of the people, and that was not acceptable.\u201d She said she did what was necessary to try to alleviate the problems.\nMs. Bachelet had faced worse before. Her father, an air force general, was tortured for months under the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet and died in prison. Military officials also detained and tortured Ms. Bachelet and her mother before they were allowed to go into exile in Australia. Ms. Bachelet returned in 1979.\nAfter democracy was restored, she worked for the National AIDS Commission. In 2000, President Lagos named her health minister, and she drew controversy for allowing the free distribution of the morning-after pill for victims of sexual abuse. Later, she was appointed defense minister, the first woman in a Latin American country to hold such a post.\nBut the economic front is where she turned around her presidency.\nMs. Bachelet resisted the cries of politicians to use revenues from copper sales to try to close Chile\u2019s inequality gap, one of the world\u2019s worst. Instead, during her first three years in office, her government set aside $35 billion in revenue from the boom. When the global financial crisis hit, the value of Chile\u2019s exports sank by more than 30 percent. But by then Chile had nearly $20 billion invested in overseas sovereign wealth funds alone.\n\u201cWe have the distinction of perhaps having the only sovereign funds that made money during the crisis,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Velasco, Chile\u2019s finance minister.\nLast year, after carrying high public debt for more than two decades, Chile became a net creditor for the first time in its history, Mr. Velasco said.\nWith billions of dollars saved, Ms. Bachelet\u2019s government legalized alimony payments to divorced women and tripled the number of free early child care centers for low-income families. It added a minimum pension guarantee for the very poor and for low-income homemakers. The government is on pace to complete its goal of creating 3,500 child care centers, said Mar\u00eda Estela Ortiz, executive vice president of Chile\u2019s National Board of Day Care Centers.\nMs. Bachelet, a pediatrician, said, \u201cI believe that if you want to fight inequality you have to do it starting at infancy.\u201d\nOpposition politicians who once criticized her social-protection efforts as a retreat to an era of big government are now saying they will try to expand her programs to the middle class.\nHer unorthodox style has left a mark on the country\u2019s political culture, analysts said. During her state of the nation address in May, she joked about losing a shoe while kicking a soccer ball at a stadium inauguration, saying investment in four new stadiums would include money for \u201cthe flying shoe.\u201d In the recent interview, she joked that her gender parity plan for the cabinet was intended to ensure that everyone had a dance partner.\nThat personal air has also inspired criticism, for example, when she was photographed taking an early-morning ocean swim in Brazil last year during a conference of regional leaders, or received popular artists like Bono and Shakira.\n\u201cShe did things that were not presidential in the eyes of the Chilean establishment,\u201d said Ms. Lagos, the pollster. \u201cIt is very difficult to go back. She lowered the presidency closer to the people.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/world/americas/29bachelet.html", "title": "Chilean President Rides High as Term Ends", "author": "ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO"}
{"date": "Sun, 19 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Iran\u2019s reformist former president Mohammad Khatami called Sunday for a referendum on the legitimacy of the government in the wake of last month\u2019s disputed presidential election, Iranian Web sites reported.\nMr. Khatami\u2019s comments amounted to a bold challenge to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has dismissed the opposition\u2019s claims that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s landslide victory on June 12 was rigged, and has ordered protesters to accept it.\nIt is unlikely that Iran\u2019s hard-line leaders will accept the referendum proposal. But the fact that Mr. Khatami proposed it at all suggests a renewed confidence within the opposition movement.\nThat movement received a powerful boost on Friday when an influential former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, told a gathering at Tehran that the government had lost the trust of many Iranians, and he called for the release of the protesters arrested since the election.\nHis speech at Tehran University brought vast crowds of opposition supporters into the streets of the capital, where they chanted antigovernment slogans and clashed with police officers in the largest demonstration in weeks.\nMr. Khatami on Sunday praised Mr. Rafsanjani\u2019s speech and said a referendum would help achieve Mr. Rafsanjani\u2019s goal of restoring trust, reformist Web sites and the BBC\u2019s Persian service reported. He said it should be carried out by an independent body, like the Expediency Council, an arbitration group that is headed by Mr. Rafsanjani.\n\u201cIf the majority of people accept the situation, we also will accept it,\u201d Mr. Khatami said, Web sites reported.\nThe referendum proposal coincided with a possible sign that the government was willing to make some concessions. Mr. Khatami was visiting a group of family members of opposition figures who had been arrested since the election, and while there, the arrested men called their relatives from prison for the first time, in what appeared to be a coordinated gesture.\nMr. Rafsanjani traveled over the weekend to the northeastern city of Mashad to discuss the postelection political crisis with high-ranking Shiite clerics. The move was likely to fuel rumors that Mr. Rafsanjani is building clerical support for the opposition. Two of the clerics Mr. Rafsanjani was meeting have declined to congratulate Mr. Ahmadinejad on his victory and may already be sympathetic to the opposition\u2019s claims that the election was rigged for Mr. Ahmadinejad.\nMr. Rafsanjani\u2019s reception in Mashad contrasted strikingly with that of Mr. Ahmadinejad, who was snubbed by at least one top-ranking cleric during his own visit two days earlier.\nOn Saturday, the government released on bail an employee of the British Embassy in Tehran who was arrested last month and accused of fomenting postelection street protests, Iran\u2019s state-run Press TV reported. The employee, Hossein Rassam, was the head of the security and political division at the embassy, the station reported. Eight other embassy staff members who were arrested had been released.\nAlthough some Iranian conservatives have criticized Mr. Rafsanjani for his speech on Friday, more have made stinging criticisms of Mr. Ahmadinejad over a controversial cabinet appointment made public on the same day. The president named as his first vice president Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who angered hard-liners by saying in 2008 that Iranians are \u201cfriends of all people in the world \u2014 even Israelis.\u201d Mr. Mashaei, whose daughter is married to the president\u2019s son, also angered clerics in 2007 when he attended a ceremony in Turkey in which women performed a traditional dance.\nOn Saturday, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a prominent conservative, called the appointment of Mr. Mashaei \u201ccompletely unbelievable\u201d and said to promote him was to \u201cridicule the highest religious authorities.\u201d Other conservatives made similar comments, including figures in the Basij militia. Kayhan, a newspaper close to Ayatollah Khamenei, called the appointment a \u201cmistake\u201d that would \u201cno doubt provoke strong opposition.\u201d\nAlthough many conservatives criticized Mr. Ahmadinejad in the past, especially over his economic policies, most supported him during the protests of the past month. Only now, as he begins to name his new cabinet, have differences begun to emerge again.\nAlso on Sunday, Iran\u2019s Jahan News reported that Iranian security forces had foiled an effort to assassinate both Mir Hussein Moussavi, the main challenger to Mr. Ahmadinejad, and Mehdi Karroubi, another candidate in the presidential election, both of whom have called the June 12 vote fraudulent. The report attributed the information to unnamed sources and claimed the would-be assassins were from the Mujahedin-e Khalq, a militant group that seeks to overthrow the Iranian government.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/world/middleeast/20iran.html", "title": "Ex-President in Iran Seeks Referendum", "author": "ROBERT F.

{"date": "Tue, 05 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KAKINADA, India \u2014 Fleeing the bitter end of a quarter-century-long war, the refugees turned to a boat. It was first a shelter from artillery shells, then a frail craft to safety. Finally, it became a coffin.\nThe boat was adrift on the Indian Ocean for nine days. Jaya Niranjana\u2019s 3-year-old daughter died. M. Yesudas lost his father, sister, nephew, brothers, and uncle \u2014 six in all. An 8-month-old baby, Kuberan, survived only because his mother somehow managed to breast-feed him until just hours before she died.\nBy the time these refugees fleeing the war in Sri Lanka reached Indian shores last Wednesday, 10 of the 21 original travelers had died or jumped overboard. They had nothing to eat and only saltwater to drink. The scorching sun beat down on their heads. Diarrhea struck. The first child died on April 24, then the others. S. Indira Meenan, 25, recalled it in halting English: \u201cOne by one. Dead babies, children. No food, no drink.\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-fourth, dead; 25th; 26th,\u201d he went on. \u201cOne by one. Dead.\u201d\nThis is the story of their boat, and their country\u2019s civil war, seemingly endless even as the Sri Lankan government closes in on the last stronghold of the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels, the L.T.T.E., short for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.\nThe government has trapped the remaining rebel force in a four-mile strip of territory in the northeast corner of Sri Lanka. Pressing its final assault, the government has rebuffed heavy international pressure to suspend the war for the sake of an estimated 50,000 civilians trapped in rebel territory and a no-fire zone between the forces.\nIn the dead of night, the boat left the sandy spit of land where fighting raged. Its captain had apparently steered the vessel far out into the sea, in an effort to evade the fighting, and then lost his way.\nHe had promised his passengers a journey of nine hours to the closest point on the Indian coast, about 100 miles, far shorter than the distance from Miami to Havana.\nBut the boat\u2019s outboard motor gave out after a few hours. By Day 9, the captain jumped into the sea \u2014 whether from guilt or delirium, no one will ever know.\nThe testimony of these refugees in an Indian government hospital is a rare glimpse into Sri Lanka\u2019s war zone; the government bars journalists and most aid workers from anywhere near there. It is also a measure of the desperation of its survivors, the latest among an estimated 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamils who have taken refuge in India over the past 20 years.\nThese refugees said they did not want to be quarantined in a Sri Lankan-government-controlled camp, where tens of thousands of displaced ethnic Tamils have fled in recent weeks.\nInstead, they took the risky journey across the water. They considered themselves lucky. Unlike many others, they had a boat, a motor and kerosene for fuel.\nFor two months, their boat, a fiberglass vessel no more than 20 feet long, first served as a bunker on the last bit of coast in Mullaittivu district on the northeastern corner of the island. The boat belonged to Mr. Yesudas. He and his relatives had dug it into the ground, covered it with palm tree trunks for a roof, and hid inside when artillery shells rained down.\nThe area, a village called Mathalan, had been designated by the Sri Lankan government as a \u201cno-fire zone.\u201d But the refugees said in separate interviews that it was shelled every day, sometimes so much that they had to relieve themselves in buckets rather than venture outside the boat-bunker.\nOn one side of the sandy spit was the sea. On the other stood the front line of the Tamil Tigers, exchanging artillery fire with the Sri Lankan Army across a narrow lagoon. Those shells landed in the no-fire zone. For nearly two months, according to United Nations estimates, more than 150,000 civilians, including these refugees, were trapped inside. About 50,000 remain there now, the United Nations estimates. It has repeatedly pressed the Tamil Tigers to let their people go, and the government to stop firing on civilians. Both sides have rebuffed those appeals, denying the charges.\nOn Wednesday, Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council to begin deliberations on Sri Lanka, \u201cto avoid further loss of civilian life.\u201d\nTwo and a half weeks ago, on April 20, the refugees said, they witnessed the most intense fighting. The army that day broke through a mud embankment that shielded a portion of the last rebel-held spit of coast, allowing tens of thousands of civilians to flee into government-held territory. The Tamil Tigers said later that 1,000 civilians had been killed as the military advanced. The military, for its part, released satellite images that showed rebel fighters firing on civilians trying to flee.\nThe refugees here recalled that both sides shelled indiscriminately that day, and that those among them who hid in their bunkers had no time to count the dead.\nAbout 1 a.m., after the shelling had stopped, they dug out the boat from under the sand and quietly took it out into the sea. Had the Tamil Tigers detected them trying to escape, Mr. Yesudas said flatly, they would have shot at the boat. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t get out that day, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten out at all.\u201d\nThey had all fled fighting before. Mr. Yesudas\u2019s family filed out of their ancestral village in Jaffna Peninsula in 1996, following the rebels as the army chased them out. The family settled into a new village, prospered and saved their sons and daughters from being forced to fight with the guerrillas. When the war resumed last year, they ran from village to village, hoping that a cease-fire would soon come.\nSivadasa Jagadeeswaran, the father of Kuberan, the baby, said that for nearly 10 months, his family had been on the run, too, living mostly in makeshift tents of bedsheets and palm fronds. There were not enough tents to go around, and not enough food. A month before he fled, his father was killed, he thinks by shelling, in the main market in the no-fire zone. They found his father\u2019s body at the hospital, the back of his head blown out entirely.\nEarly on April 21, he stepped into the boat with his wife and their two sons. Their eldest, age 4, was among the first to die. They threw the child into the sea. Then, his wife\u2019s father died. Her two brothers jumped overboard, lured by the twinkling lights of what may have been a fishing trawler. His wife held on until the last day. She complained of thirst, but vomited when he gave her seawater. Soon, she was gone.\nThis afternoon, a single father to an only child, he cooed softly to the baby on the hospital bed. He gave him a bottle of milk. He checked to make sure his diapers weren\u2019t wet. The baby giggled, oblivious to the misery around him.\nIndira Kumar and his wife, Jaya, watched him from the next bed. He said he decided to leave that night to save his daughter, Prasambavi. She, too, held out until the last day on the boat. The night before, she had begged for a cold drink.\nTheir boat was first noticed by an Indian fisherman, K. Srinivas Rao, who had gone shark hunting that day, roughly 90 miles from shore. In the distance, he saw two men waving their arms frantically. One of them was holding up a baby. When he got closer, he saw that most of the passengers were so weak they could hardly move. He drew the boat to the shore. The strangers could barely explain their circumstances. They spoke only Tamil.\nMr. Yesudas said he had no interest in going home. He had saved his family for so long, and lost so many. He had no hope that things would get any better anytime soon in Sri Lanka, not even after the war is declared over.\n\u201cThe L.T.T.E. is not going to stop. The army is not going to stop,\u201d he said, referring to the rebel group. \u201cIt is an eternal war.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/world/asia/06lanka.html", "title": "Boat to Safety Is Death Trap to Sri Lankans", "author": "SOMINI SENGUPTA"}

They point to evidence that the growth is already harming the ecosystem that allowed the islands\u2019 more famous inhabitants \u2014 among them giant tortoises and boobies with brightly colored webbed feet \u2014 to evolve in isolation before mainlanders started colonizing the islands more than a century ago.\nThe growth has become enough of a threat to the environment that even the government, which still welcomes growth in the tourism industry, has expelled more than 1,000 poor Ecuadoreans in the past year from a province that they feel is rightfully theirs, and it is in the process of expelling many more.\nBy limiting the population, officials hope to preserve the natural wonders that bolster one of Ecuador\u2019s most profitable sectors: tourism. But the measures are feeding a backlash among unskilled migrants who say they are being punished while the country continues to enjoy the many millions of dollars tourists bring to Ecuador, one of South America\u2019s poorest nations.\n\u201cWe are being told that a tortoise for a rich foreigner to photograph is worth more than an Ecuadorean citizen,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Mariana de Reina Bustos, 54, a migrant from Ambato in Ecuador\u2019s central Andean valley, whose 22-year-old daughter, Olga, was recently rounded up by the police near the slum of La Cascada and put on a plane to the mainland.\nThe first settlers came to the islands to live off the land, working as fishermen, ranchers and farmers. Now, most of those who make the short flight from Quito, the capital, or sneak on the islands in boats are lured by different sorts of riches: the relatively high wages they can earn as taxi drivers and hotel maids or workers in the islands\u2019 growing bureaucracy.\nFor decades, the country\u2019s leaders did little to prevent people from coming here, partly to build the tourism industry and then to ensure the government had a presence among the pioneers. There seemed to be something of a natural limit on growth: the country had put aside 97 percent of the archipelago as a park.\nBut as tourism and migration grew over the last decade, pressure began building within the archipelago\u2019s scientific and environmental community and abroad for Ecuador to act on curbing the islands\u2019 population. The United Nations put the Gal\u00e1pagos on its list of endangered heritage sites in 2007.\nScientists here said people had already done significant damage, pointing to fuel spills, the poaching of giant tortoises and sharks and the introduction of invasive species \u2014 including rats, cattle and fire ants \u2014 that threaten animals endemic to the Gal\u00e1pagos.\nEven seemingly benign human activities like owning a pet can have outsize consequences here.\n\u201cWith people come cats, and with cats come threats to other animals found nowhere else in the world,\u201d said Fernando Ortiz, coordinator of the Gal\u00e1pagos program for Conservation International.\nConflict is built into the rules that allowed the Gal\u00e1pagos to be colonized in the first place, despite a lack of fresh water in the archipelago. Technically, residency is granted to a limited number of people, including those born here and their spouses, people who arrived before 1998 and those with temporary work permits. The police, known in local slang as the \u201cmigra\u201d for their role in tracking down illegal migrants, set up impromptu checkpoints throughout the islands. But the same government that oversees the expulsions also offers subsidies to people living on the islands.\nOne subsidy allows gasoline to cost about the same here as on the mainland. Another allows residents to fly between the islands or to Quito for a fraction of what foreigners pay. Loopholes also flourish. For instance, a black market in residency thrives in which migrants marry established residents to obtain coveted identity cards.\nThe result: Puerto Ayora\u2019s streets beckon with discos, food stands and souvenir shops. On the outskirts, a billboard with the image of Leopoldo Bucheli, the pro-development mayor, celebrates a project called El Mirador that is clearing an area on the edge of town to build 1,000 new homes.\n\u201cAll we want, like people anywhere on this planet, is a dignified existence,\u201d said Yonny Mantuano, 36, who bought a lot to build a home at El Mirador. He heads the teachers union here, whose 600 members have chafed at one of the government\u2019s new attempts to limit subsidies: a measure this year cutting their cost-of-living bonus.\nThe government\u2019s somewhat schizophrenic view of life here is echoed by the sentiments of the people. Margarita Masaquiza, 45, an Indian from Ecuador\u2019s highlands who arrived here at the age of 14, abhors the government\u2019s expulsions.\n\u201cWe built this province with our own hands, so, yes, it pains us to see our countrymen deported like animals,\u201d Ms. Masaquiza said. \u201cAfter all, we are indigenous Ecuadoreans, how can we be illegal in our own country?\u201d\nBut when asked how she felt about the impact of new migrants on her four children and four grandchildren, Ms. Masaquiza adopted a different tone.\n\u201cWe must preserve opportunities for our families,\u201d she said.\nMost people in the Gal\u00e1pagos live on San Crist\u00f3bal, an island where a penal colony functioned decades ago, and Santa Cruz, where Puerto Ayora is located. Development is spreading to other parts of the archipelago, as well.\nIsabela, the largest of the islands, offers a glimpse into the Gal\u00e1pagos frontier.\nDespite its streets of sand, Puerto Villamil, Isabela\u2019s main town, looks not unlike a Phoenix subdivision around 2007. Laborers work feverishly on 200 new cinderblock homes on the town\u2019s edge. Only about 2,000 people live in the town, but it has one of the Gal\u00e1pagos\u2019s highest rates of population growth, about 9 percent a year.\n\u201cI earn $1,200 a month here, while I could only earn $500 a month on the continent,\u201d said Bol\u00edvar Buri, 26, a construction worker born in Puerto Villamil who made a small fortune this year when he sold an empty lot for $8,000 that he bought six years ago for $600.\nBut even in the archipelago\u2019s less spoiled areas, there is little doubt that man\u2019s intrusion has altered life on the islands that enraptured Darwin.\nOn the road from Puerto Villamil to the drizzle-shrouded crater of the Sierra Negra volcano, subsistence hunters on horseback scan the forest for wild pigs, a species introduced by mariners over a century ago. White cattle egrets, another introduced species, fly overhead.\nOne recent day, Manuel L\u00f3pez, a cowboy and migrant from the mainland who tends a herd under the volcano\u2019s mist, emerged from a forest thick with guava trees.\nHe paused under the equatorial sun; his gaze narrowed.\n\u201cIf it is God\u2019s will, I\u2019m on this island to stay,\u201d said Mr. L\u00f3pez, 36.\n\u201cWe must be in Gal\u00e1pagos for a reason,\u201d he said, prodding a visitor to reply. \u201cYes or no?\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/world/americas/05galapagos.html", "title": "To Protect Gal\u00e1pagos, Ecuador Limits a Two-Legged Species", "author": "SIMON ROMERO"}

But the centrist president, Traian Basescu, refused to concede the race, claiming media manipulation and declaring himself the true victor.\nOfficial voting results had not been released and were expected Monday.\nThe election night drama came after a rough campaign marked by scandals and political attacks.\n\u201cThis victory is a victory for normality and common sense and all Romanians who wish for a better life,\u201d said Mr. Geoana, before a cheering crowd at the party\u2019s headquarters, bathed in red, yellow and blue lights for the colors of the Romanian flag. \u201cWhen Romanian people are united, no one can stop us.\u201d\nBut Mr. Basescu, when asked if he would concede as he left the headquarters of his Democratic Liberal Party late Sunday, said: \u201cNo, I win. It\u2019s the same as in 2004,\u201d referring to the close victory that made him president five years ago.\nHis staff pointed to unofficial early vote tallies, which they said showed him in the lead.\n\u201cI refuse to believe that Romania, 20 years after the revolution, can vote for the reds,\u201d said Cristina Adam, 41, a supporter outside Mr. Basescu\u2019s headquarters, linking the more moderate socialists with the country\u2019s former Communist dictatorship.\nIn interviews during the day at polling stations around Bucharest, the capital, disillusioned Romanians said that they went to the polls on Sunday seeking change and a modicum of political stability at a moment of economic turmoil.\nBut instead of focusing on the economy, which is expected to contract 8.5 percent this year in a country that has fallen hard after years of living beyond its means on easy credit, the final week before the election was dominated by a video from a 2004 campaign rally in which Mr. Basescu appeared to strike a 10-year-old boy in the face.\nThe president\u2019s campaign has said that he did not slap the boy and that the video was drastically altered, but it became a fixture in the media. The video appeared to resonate with voters in part because Mr. Basescu, a former ship captain who became the mayor of Bucharest and campaigned for president as a fighter of corruption, has a reputation for being quarrelsome.\n\u201cAggressive can be good, but not all the time, how Basescu makes it the last few years,\u201d said Anamaria Essig, 35, a chef, who said she voted for Mr. Geoana for the sake of political stability. \u201cYou can\u2019t work like that.\u201d\nMr. Geoana has tried to position himself as a steadying influence compared with the combative Mr. Basescu. Mr. Geoana promised to name the independent Klaus Johannis, the popular provincial mayor of the Transylvanian town of Sibiu, as prime minister leading a coalition government if elected.\nThe centrist government of Prime Minister Emil Boc collapsed after a no-confidence vote in October.\nThe political instability has stalled much-needed loans from the International Monetary Fund as part of a $30 billion aid package for the country\u2019s reeling economy.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/world/europe/07romania.html", "title": "Victory Claimed by Both Candidates in Romania", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH"}
{"date": "Fri, 25 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The Taliban released a video of a captured American soldier on Friday, the second to surface since he was seized in southern Afghanistan about six months ago.\nPfc. Bowe Bergdahl, 23, of Idaho, was captured in late June in Paktika Province, a rural, mountainous region along the Pakistani border where the Taliban have a large presence. The circumstances of his capture remain unclear. Initially, military officials said he had walked off his outpost in eastern Afghanistan. But in the first video, which the Taliban sent out in July, Private Bergdahl said he had been captured after he lagged behind during a patrol.\nPrivate Bergdahl\u2019s family issued a statement urging his captors to release him, The Associated Press reported Friday. In the statement, which The A.P. said was disseminated by Lt. Col. Tim Marsano of the Idaho National Guard, the family tells the missing soldier: \u201cWe love you and we believe in you. Stay strong.\u201d\nSenior NATO officials called the release of the new video \u201ca horrible act\u201d and said the Taliban clearly timed it carefully.\n\u201cThis is a horrible act which exploits a young soldier, who was clearly compelled to read a prepared statement,\u201d said Rear Adm. Gregg Smith of the United States Navy, NATO\u2019s chief of communications, in a statement e-mailed to reporters. \u201cTo release this video on Christmas Day is an affront to the deeply concerned family and friends of Bowe Bergdahl, demonstrating contempt for religious traditions and the teachings of Islam.\u201d\nAlthough the video was released Friday, it was unclear when it was made, said Col. Wayne Shanks, a NATO spokesman, suggesting that it might be a pastiche of clips from earlier in the year.\n\u201cWe are not using this as a proof-of-life video,\u201d Colonel Shanks said. \u201cIt\u2019s still to be determined when it was made, but it could have been made even several months ago. It has a lot of editing pieces.\u201d\nThe 36-minute video was posted on a Web site affiliated with the Afghan Taliban, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks militant Islamist Web sites. The video alternates clips of Private Bergdahl in a helmet and uniform with those of him in the traditional Afghan shalwar kameez tunic and simple cap worn by many men here.\nHe gives his birthplace, blood type and his mother\u2019s maiden name as proof of his identity and then criticizes the United States. He says that unlike prisoners of the United States, which has tortured Muslim captives \u201cin Bagram, in Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghraib,\u201d he has been treated fairly. The United States Army, he says, gives its soldiers propaganda about the people they are fighting.\n\u201cEven though I am prisoner of war, however, I had a chance to rethink a lot of things and to ask myself questions that I never asked myself before,\u201d he says.\n\u201cOne of the biggest illusions that the Army gives us coming over here as a soldier, as a private in their army, is that we\u2019re coming over here to fight a terrorist group of men.\n\u201cWe are fighting a country and a people that are well organized and extremely smart of how to fight. I keep bringing up the point of history to people that I talk to. You simply need to look at their history to understand that the Afghan people know how to fight, and they have lived this way since the beginning of their people,\u201d he says.\nThe video also includes clips of President Obama meeting with veterans who are asking him to stop the war; and photographs of former President George W. Bush and of Muslims in American custody. There is also an interview with an Afghan who implies that his home was destroyed by an American bomb and asks the Americans to leave his country. The film also includes a brief clip of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, described by a narrator as \u201ca hired stooge\u201d of the United States.\nAt the end of the video, a Taliban spokesman, Zabiballah Mujahid, demands the release of a \u201climited numbers of prisoners\u201d in exchange for Private Bergdahl and says that if there is no deal, more soldiers will be captured.\nAdmiral Smith said the military would continue to search for Private Bergdahl.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/world/asia/26afghan.html", "title": "Taliban Shows Video of Captured G.I.", "author": "ALISSA J.

John Harrison of the Parachute Regiment, an elite airborne infantry unit.\nPrime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed Wednesday that an unnamed British serviceman lost his life in a nighttime raid early Wednesday on a remote Afghan village where the Times reporter, Stephen Farrell, and a Times interpreter, Sultan Munadi, were being held hostage by the Taliban.\nMr. Farrell emerged from the raid unharmed, but Mr. Munadi, 34, was killed by gunfire as the two men fled the house where they were held. They had been seized by the Taliban on Saturday, when they traveled to a village near the northern city of Kunduz to report on a NATO airstrike that villagers claimed had killed 80 to 90 civilians.\nBritish news reports, citing the Defense Ministry, said two Afghan civilians in addition to Mr. Munadi were killed in Wednesday\u2019s raid, including at least one woman.\nIn the ministry\u2019s statement, Corporal Harrison was described by his commanding officer, who was not named, as \u201can immensely capable, self-effacing and highly likable soldier with an irrepressible humor.\u201d He added: \u201cAlthough his passing is a sad day for us, every member of the unit counts themselves privileged to have known such a tower of strength.\u201d\nThe statement also quoted a tribute from Corporal Harrison\u2019s family. \u201cWe are absolutely heartbroken,\u201d it said. \u201cJohn was a wonderful son, brother and a dedicated soldier who was greatly loved and cherished by all his family and friends.\u201d\nThe announcement gave no details of the raid, which American and British officials described on Wednesday as having been carried out by British special forces members transported by United States helicopters and assisted by Afghan Army units. Officials in Washington said that British commandos had planned and carried out the raid, but that the United States provided intelligence assistance and had attack aircraft ready if needed.\nThe decision to name Corporal Harrison appeared to reflect the political sensitivity of the raid and its outcome in Britain, where national newspapers made headline news of the raid on Thursday and raised questions about its advisability and timing. Generally, British service members killed in special forces operations are not named, a practice the Defense Ministry has attributed to the need for operational secrecy.\nThe questions centered on the decision to conduct the raid while there may still have been a good chance of negotiating the men\u2019s release, and whether soldiers should have been asked to risk their lives to save a reporter who, some reports in Britain said, had apparently ventured into dangerous territory despite receiving warnings. The military said it acted after receiving indications that the men would be moved to Pakistan, where rescue would have been virtually impossible.\nIn a long, first-person account in a blog on The New York Times Web site, Mr. Farrell described himself as \u201ccomfortable\u201d with his decision to go ahead with his reporting trip and said it seemed to him that the Taliban were preparing to move him and Mr. Munadi to another province.\nBritain\u2019s main special forces unit in Afghanistan is the Special Boat Service, a naval unit. But in Afghanistan and Iraq, special forces units deployed by Britain have also involved soldiers of the Parachute Regiment, which was established on Winston Churchill\u2019s orders in World War II.\nThe Defense Ministry offered few other details of the raid. But the BBC reported an unnamed government spokesman as saying that final approval was granted by two senior cabinet ministers, Foreign Secretary David Miliband and Defense Secretary Bob Ainsworth. The spokesman was quoted as saying that the decision followed consultations with Mr. Brown and advice from the government\u2019s emergency committee, known as Cobra.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/world/asia/11afghan.html", "title": "Britain Names Soldier Killed in Afghan Raid", "author": "JOHN F.

{"date": "Wed, 18 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 Seaborne raiders in a high-speed skiff tried again on Wednesday to commandeer the Maersk Alabama, the American-flagged ship seized by pirates in April, the United States Navy said.\nIn a separate episode, the captain of a hijacked chemical tanker was reported to have died of gunshot wounds inflicted when pirates seized the MV Theresa with 28 North Korean crew members northwest of the Seychelles on Monday. The spate of attacks reflected the increasing boldness of pirates roaming far from their bases in Somalia to seize vessels and sailors to hold for ransom.\nThe United States Navy Central Command said four suspected pirates in a skiff came within 300 yards of the Maersk Alabama at 6.30 a.m. Wednesday about 600 miles off the northeast coast of Somalia as it headed for the Kenyan port of Mombasa.\nBut a security team on board the Maersk Alabama responded with small-arms fire, long-range acoustical devices painful to the human ear and evasive maneuvers to thwart the attack, the Navy said in a statement.\n\u201cDue to Maersk Alabama following maritime industry\u2019s best practices such as embarking security teams, the ship was able to prevent being successfully attacked by pirates,\u201d said Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, the commander of the Central Command. \u201cThis is a great example of how merchant mariners can take pro-active action to prevent being attacked.\u201d\nNo injuries or damage were reported, the Navy said.\nPirates in Xarardheere, one of their strongholds in Somalia, said Wednesday that some of their colleagues had been killed Tuesday night.\n\u201cWe have been told over the phone today that four of our colleagues were killed and two were injured,\u201d said a Somali pirate boss known as Red Teeth. \u201cWe will keep attacking on foreign vessels until illegal fishing and toxic dump is stopped,\u201d he added.\nThe Maersk Alabama was seized on April 8, and the ship\u2019s captain, Richard Phillips, was held at gunpoint in a lifeboat until United States Navy snipers shot and killed three attackers. The fourth, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, was taken to New York, where he has pleaded not guilty to charges of piracy.\nSomali pirates released 36 crew members and their Spanish fishing vessel, the Alakrana, on Tuesday, but the Spanish prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, declined to comment on reports that a ransom of nearly $3.5 million had been paid for the Alakrana and its crew. \u201cThe government did what it had to do,\u201d he said.\nWitnesses in Xarardheere said that 80 luxury automobiles crowded the shore as friends and family members of pirates clamored to get a share of the ransom money. \u201cI came here to get some money from my friend, who is receiving his share today,\u201d said one resident, Mohamoud Elmi.\nOn Wednesday, pirates said the body of the captain was being kept in a refrigerator on board the Theresa as it headed toward Somalia under the attackers\u2019 control.\nA pirate in Xarardheere who goes by the name Omar said that the captain was killed Tuesday as the pirates tried to board the ship. He fired a flare gun, and the pirates, thinking they were being fired upon, responded by shooting him.\nThe Theresa, registered in the Virgin Islands and operated from Singapore, had been heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa when it was hijacked about 200 miles northwest of the Seychelles, the European Union\u2019s naval force said in a statement on its Web site.\nIn addition to 14 commercial vessels now under their control, pirates are holding a British couple, Paul and Rachel Chandler, snatched from their 38-foot sailboat off the Seychelles last month.\nWhen it was hijacked in April, the 508-foot-long Alabama was en route to the Kenyan port of Mombasa and was carrying food and other agricultural materials for the World Food Program, a United Nations agency, and other clients, including the United States Agency for International Development.\nIt was on a regular rotation through the Indian Ocean from Salalah, a city in southwestern Oman, to Djibouti, and then on to Mombasa, according to the company\u2019s headquarters in Denmark.\nBuilt in Taiwan in 1998, the ship can carry more than 1,000 20-foot containers.\nThe attempt to seize it again showed just how much piracy has become a multimillion-dollar business in Somalia, a nation that has limped along since 1991 without a functioning central government, offering a haven for an array of seaborne brigands while, on land, the country is torn by civil strife.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/world/africa/19pirates.html", "title": "Pirates Attack Maersk Alabama Again", "author": "ALAN COWELL"}
{"date": "Fri, 30 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 For Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has had her ups and downs with the news media, the prospect of spending three days under the remorseless glare of the Pakistani news media might have felt like an unwelcome return to a time right before the New Hampshire primary.\nYet Mrs. Clinton, whose press clippings since she became secretary of state have been kinder than when she was a presidential candidate, rolled with the punches this week in a media-saturated tour of Pakistan. She submitted to four round-table interviews over three days in which Pakistan\u2019s leading journalists took their best shots at her, and she even counterpunched once or twice.\nBy the time she left Islamabad on Friday, she appeared to have fought Pakistan\u2019s fourth estate to a draw.\n\u201cOn the whole, Ms. Clinton made a very deliberate effort to bridge the divide that has recently grown and talked of constructing a special relationship,\u201d said an editorial in The News, one of Pakistan\u2019s main English-language daily newspapers. It did, however, chide her for snarling traffic in Lahore, the country\u2019s second-largest city, which she visited on Thursday under elaborate security.\nEngaging Pakistan\u2019s unruly media was perhaps Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most important job on this visit. Newspapers and television drive public opinion more here than in many countries, and the coverage is sharply critical of the United States, tapping into deep Pakistani resentment.\nThat poses a problem for the Obama administration, which needs Pakistan to join its campaign to fight extremists and stabilize Afghanistan. The latest spike in anti-American sentiment here was driven by media reports that a new aid bill would infringe on Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty.\n\u201cI will admit that clearly there is a lot of misperception, and perception is reality, so therefore it is up to us to try to set it straight,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said Wednesday in an interview with seven television journalists. \u201cFrankly, I think one of the problems is that we did not have a program to reach out to the Pakistani press. That will never happen again.\u201d\nNajam Sethi, the editor of The Friday Times, an English-language weekly, said \u201cthe media is part of the problem, not the solution.\u201d Much of the news media, he said, is driven by fervent nationalism and uncritical support for Pakistan\u2019s murky entanglements with radical groups in the region.\nAfter the press was unshackled by President Pervez Musharraf during his last years in power, it exploded into a cacophony of publications, many of which gleefully traffic in rumors.\n\u201cShe did well to interact,\u201d Mr. Sethi said. \u201cShe may not have made many new friends, but she certainly didn\u2019t make new enemies.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton sat down first with the TV journalists because they set the agenda. So great is their influence that the questions posed to Mrs. Clinton by young people the next day sounded like those the broadcasters had asked \u2014 blunt and combative, though just short of rude.\nAn example came Friday at an interview for the program \u201cOur Voice\u201d when a young woman asked Mrs. Clinton whether she viewed the Predator drone attacks used by the United States in Pakistan\u2019s frontier areas as terrorism.\n\u201cNo, I do not,\u201d she replied.\nEarlier in the week when Mrs. Clinton was asked about this highly classified drone program, she steadfastly declined to comment.\nMrs. Clinton showed a similar flash of defiance when she was asked why the United States viewed Pakistan as the focus of the global campaign against terrorism. She pointed out that Al Qaeda\u2019s leaders had sought refuge in Pakistan since 2002 and she suggested that the Pakistani government had done less than it should have to root them out.\nAt the interview on Friday, she was also asked why the United States micromanaged Pakistan\u2019s affairs, why there was such a deep \u201ctrust deficit\u201d between the countries, and whether the private security contractors who guard the embassy here were shielded by diplomatic immunity.\nMrs. Clinton answered the first two but said she was not sure of the answer to the third. Pakistani papers have run articles reporting that contractors were illegally carrying weapons in Islamabad.\nThe newspapers and television gave ample coverage to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s visit. But some could not resist taking a shot: The Nation, an English-language daily, carried an unflattering front-page picture of Mrs. Clinton, with her eyes bulging and her face twisted in mock horror.\nOn Wednesday, news channels juxtaposed images of Mrs. Clinton with carnage at the women\u2019s market in Peshawar, connecting her arrival with the car bomb that killed more than 100 people the same day.\nMrs. Clinton said she had expected a rough reception. One aide said she insisted on not excluding journalists known for their anti-American views, against the advice of some at the embassy.\nShe also went out of her way to cultivate radio journalists, giving them an hourlong interview on Friday. The special American representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, is developing a plan to encourage new FM radio stations as a way to counterbalance propaganda from radio stations that fall into the hands of the Taliban or other militants.\n\u201cThey use the radio to say that women shouldn\u2019t go to school, to say that women shouldn\u2019t go out of their homes,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s very intimidating, that\u2019s very frightening.\u201d\nBy the end of her visit, Madam Secretary seemed to have fine-tuned her image.

{"date": "Sat, 17 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Nearly two decades after the collapse of the Communist Party, Russia\u2019s rulers have hit upon a model for future success: the Communist Party.\nOr at least, the one that reigns next door.\nLike an envious underachiever, Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s party, United Russia, is increasingly examining how it can emulate the Chinese Communist Party, especially its skill in shepherding China through the financial crisis relatively unbowed.\nUnited Russia\u2019s leaders even convened a special meeting this month with senior Chinese Communist Party officials to hear firsthand how they wield power.\nIn truth, the Russians express no desire to return to Communism as a far-reaching Marxist-Leninist ideology, whether the Soviet version or the much attenuated one in Beijing. What they admire, it seems, is the Chinese ability to use a one-party system to keep tight control over the country while still driving significant economic growth.\nIt is a historical turnabout that resonates, given that the Chinese Communists were inspired by the Soviets, before the two sides had a lengthy rift.\nFor the Russians, what matters is the countries\u2019 divergent paths in recent decades. They are acutely aware that even as Russia has endured many dark days in its transition to a market economy, China appears to have carried out a fairly similar shift more artfully.\nThe Russians also seem almost ashamed that their economy is highly dependent on oil, gas and other natural resources, as if Russia were a third world nation, while China excels at manufacturing products sought by the world.\n\u201cThe accomplishments of China\u2019s Communist Party in developing its government deserve the highest marks,\u201d Aleksandr D. Zhukov, a deputy prime minister and senior Putin aide, declared at the meeting with Chinese officials on Oct. 9 in the border city of Suifenhe, China, northwest of Vladivostok. \u201cThe practical experience they have should be intensely studied.\u201d\nMr. Zhukov invited President Hu Jintao, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, to United Russia\u2019s convention, in November in St. Petersburg.\nThe meeting in Suifenhe capped several months of increased contacts between the political parties. In the spring, a high-level United Russia delegation visited Beijing for several days of talks, and United Russia announced that it would open an office in Beijing for its research arm.\nThe fascination with the Chinese Communist Party underscores United Russia\u2019s lack of a core philosophy. The party has functioned largely as an arm of Mr. Putin\u2019s authority, even campaigning on the slogan \u201cPutin\u2019s Plan.\u201d Lately, it has championed \u201cRussian Conservatism,\u201d without detailing what exactly that is.\nIndeed, whether United Russia\u2019s effort to learn from the Chinese Communist Party is anything more than an intellectual exercise is an open question.\nWhatever the motivation, Russia in recent years has started moving toward the Chinese model politically and economically. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia plunged into capitalism haphazardly, selling off many industries and loosening regulation. Under Mr. Putin, the government has reversed course, seizing more control over many sectors.\nToday, both countries govern with a potent centralized authority, overseeing economies with a mix of private and state industries, although the Russians have long seemed less disciplined in doing so.\nCorruption is worse in Russia than China, according to global indexes, and foreign companies generally consider Russia\u2019s investment climate less hospitable as well, in part because of less respect for property rights.\nRussia has also been unable to match China in modernizing roads, airports, power plants and other infrastructure. And Russia is grappling with myriad health and social problems that have reduced the average life expectancy for men to 60. One consequence is a demographic crisis that is expected to drag down growth.\nThe world financial crisis accentuated comparisons between the economies, drawing attention to Moscow\u2019s policies. In June, the World Bank projected that China\u2019s economy would grow by 7.2 percent in 2009, while Russia\u2019s would shrink by 7.9 percent.\nPolitically, Russia remains more open than China, with independent (though often co-opted) opposition parties and more freedom of speech. The most obvious contrast involves the Internet, which is censored in China but not in Russia.\nEven so, Mr. Putin\u2019s political aides have long studied how to move the political system to the kind that took root for many decades in countries like Japan and Mexico, with a de facto one-party government under a democratic guise, political analysts said. The Russians tend to gloss over the fact that in many of those countries, long-serving ruling parties have fallen.\nThe Kremlin\u2019s strategy was apparent in regional elections last week, when United Russia lieutenants and government officials used strong-arm tactics to squeeze out opposition parties, according to nonpartisan monitoring organizations. United Russia won the vast majority of contests across the country.\nFar behind was the Russian Communist Party, which styles itself as the successor to the Soviet one and has some popularity among older people. The Russian Communists have also sought to build ties to their Chinese brethren, but the Chinese leadership prefers to deal with Mr. Putin\u2019s party.\nThe regional elections highlighted how the Russian government and United Russia have become ever more intertwined. State-run television channels offer highly favorable coverage of the party, and the courts rarely if ever rule against it. United Russia leaders openly acknowledged that they wanted to study how the Chinese maintained the correct balance between the party and government.\n\u201cWe are interested in the experience of the party and government structures in China, where cooperation exists between the ruling party and the judicial, legislative and executive authorities,\u201d Vladimir E. Matkhanov, a deputy in Russia\u2019s Parliament, said at the Suifenhe meeting, according to a transcript.\nUnited Russia praises the Chinese system without mentioning its repressive aspects. And the party\u2019s stance also appears to clash with repeated declarations by Mr. Putin, the former president and current prime minister, and President Dmitri A. Medvedev that Russia needs a robust multiparty system to thrive.\nThe two endorsed the results of Sunday\u2019s local elections, despite widespread reports of fraud, prompting opposition politicians to call their words hollow.\nSergei S. Mitrokhin, leader of Yabloko, a liberal, pro-Western party that was trounced, said the elections revealed the Kremlin\u2019s true aspirations. And the China talks made them all the more clear, Mr. Mitrokhin said.\n\u201cTo me, the China meeting demonstrated that United Russia wants to establish a single-party dictatorship in Russia, for all time,\u201d he said.\nThroughout recent centuries, Russia has flirted with both the West and East, its identity never quite settled, and analysts said that under Mr. Putin, the political leadership had grown scornful of the idea that the country had to embrace Western notions of democracy or governing.\nThat in part stems from the backlash stirred in the 1990s, after the Soviet fall, when Russia faced economic hardship and political chaos, which many Putin supporters say the West helped to cause.\nDmitri Kosyrev, a political commentator for Russia\u2019s state news agency and author of detective novels set in Asia, said it was only natural that the Kremlin would cast its gaze to the East.\n\u201cWhen they discovered that there was a way to reform a formally socialist nation into something much better and more efficient, of course they would take note,\u201d Mr. Kosyrev said. \u201cEveryone here sees China as the model, because Russia is not the model.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/world/europe/18russia.html", "title": "Russia\u2019s Leaders See China as Template for Ruling", "author": "CLIFFORD J.

A prosecutor was questioning Mr. Tartaglia and a formal arrest was expected.\nFrom the San Raffaele hospital, where Mr. Berlusconi, 73, was kept overnight for observation, he said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d the ANSA news agency reported, adding that he considered it \u201ca miracle\u201d that his eyes were spared by the statuette-turned-weapon. Italian news reports said the statuette was made of heavy ceramic or metal.\nThe prime minister was \u201cshaken and disheartened\u201d when he arrived at the hospital, said Paolo Klun, a hospital spokesman. Mr. Klun said that Mr. Berlusconi had suffered two broken teeth, cuts to his lip and a \u201csmall fracture\u201d to his nose.\nThe attack raised basic questions about the level of security surrounding the prime minister, who was struck as he shook hands and signed autographs.\nThe attack also came after a particularly tense week for Mr. Berlusconi, who has been on the defensive since his wife announced last spring that she was divorcing him, citing his dalliances with young women, and since Italy\u2019s Constitutional Court in October struck down a law granting him immunity from prosecution, making him once again a defendant in several corruption trials.\nIt also comes amid a growing tide of criticism against Mr. Berlusconi. On Dec. 5 thousands marched through Rome in a peaceful protest to demand his resignation, citing conflicts of interest between his business empire and political career, as well as his efforts to pass what critics say are custom-made justice reforms aimed at solidifying his own power.\nIn his 15 years in political life, Mr. Berlusconi has generally managed to translate every personal defeat into a political victory. Although he still enjoys wide popular support, Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s popularity is beginning to erode because of Italy\u2019s economic travails and concerns that the prime minister\u2019s personal problems are affecting his ability to govern.\nIn a speech to the European People\u2019s Party congress in Bonn last week, a tense-looking Mr. Berlusconi accused magistrates and the president of Italy of left-wing bias and said the Constitutional Court was a political organ.\nIn an unusually harsh response, the president of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano, a former Communist widely respected and seen as above the fray, called Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s speech \u201ca violent attack\u201d on Italy\u2019s institutions. The left-wing opposition also criticized Mr. Berlusconi, as did the speaker of the house, Gianfranco Fini, the most outspoken critic of the prime minister within his own center-right coalition.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/world/europe/14italy.html", "title": "Attacker Fractures Berlusconi\u2019s Nose", "author": "ELISABETTA POVOLEDO and RACHEL DONADIO"}
{"date": "Sat, 28 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 In an address to a joint session of Parliament, President Asif Ali Zardari promised Saturday to ease domestic political turmoil and praised the Obama administration\u2019s new policy to Pakistan as \u201cpositive change.\u201d\nIn a conciliatory gesture to the opposition party, Pakistan Muslim League-N, Mr. Zardari said that he would lift the executive rule he had imposed on Punjab Province, the most populous province in Pakistan and one where the opposition party holds the most seats in the legislature.\nThe announcement by Mr. Zardari was seen as another major concession after the opposition party led huge street demonstrations, forcing the president to agree to the restoration of the chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who had been removed from the bench in 2007.\nIn phrases that were most likely intended to please Washington, Mr. Zardari said that Pakistan needed to \u201croot out extremism and militancy.\u201d He welcomed the new package of $7.5 billion for civilian assistance over five years formally announced by President Obama on Friday.\nThe increased American aid showed that Washington agreed with Pakistan that the best way to fight extremism was through alleviating poverty, Mr. Zardari said.\n\u201cIt is an endorsement of our call for economic and social uplift as a means to fight extremism,\u201d he said.\nThis was in implicit contrast to the eight years of rule by Pervez Musharraf, a former general, when almost all of the $10 billion in American assistance to Pakistan went to the army.\nAs he has in the past, Mr. Zardari stressed that Pakistan needed to fight the escalating extremism for its own good, a way of deflecting vocal Pakistani critics of the alliance with the United States. Mr. Zardari as much as said the fight against the militants was Pakistan\u2019s fight, not America\u2019s fight. \u201cWe are fighting militancy and extremism for our own sake,\u201d he said.\nSeparately on Saturday, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan commended the Obama administration\u2019s strategic review, saying it matched the aspirations of the Afghan people and the views of his own government.\n\u201cIt is exactly what the Afghan people were hoping for,\u201d Mr. Karzai told reporters at a news briefing in the presidential palace in Kabul. \u201cIt has our full support and backing.\u201d\nIn particular, Mr. Karzai said he was happy to see Mr. Obama\u2019s recognition that Al Qaeda and its allies were still in the region and had their bases and sanctuaries in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas. The Afghan president has been protesting for several years that the battle is fought in Afghan villages while the insurgents\u2019 headquarters, bases and training camps in Pakistan are left untouched.\n\u201cThe sanctuaries of the terrorists, the nest of the terrorists and the training places of the terrorists are not in Afghanistan; it has a regional dimension,\u201d he said.\nA major point of Mr. Obama\u2019s new policy toward Pakistan was his declaration that the United States wanted to ensure that the havens established by Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the tribal areas were eliminated. It was from these havens, he said, that Al Qaeda was plotting attacks on the United States.\nMr. Zardari did not mention the Taliban or Al Qaeda by name and did not address the power of the militants in the tribal areas or in other areas of Pakistan. Rather, he chose to make a stand about the territorial integrity of Pakistan and reinforced the notion that the government would not tolerate a breach of that sovereignty.\n\u201cThe sovereignty of Pakistan must be protected at all costs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be.\u201d\nThe insistence of Pakistan that no American or other foreign troops can operate from its territory is one of the basic challenges facing the Obama administration as it tries to find a way to eliminate the militant threat.\nOn Friday, the United States\u2019 special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, said \u201cthe red line is unambiguous and stated publicly by the Pakistani government: No foreign troops on our soil.\u201d\nBecause of that prohibition and the unsteady effort by the Pakistani Army against the militants, Washington has been deploying remotely piloted aircraft, known as drones, armed with missiles against Al Qaeda in the tribal areas. The missile attacks are extremely unpopular in Pakistan and have served to strengthen the anti-American sentiment.\nMr. Zardari, whose popularity has plummeted in recent months, in part because he is linked by many Pakistanis to American policy, did not mention the missile attacks in his speech.\nBut President Obama hinted strongly Friday that they would continue.\n\u201cPakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out Al Qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will insist that action be taken \u2014 one way or the other \u2014 when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets.\u201d\nIn his announcement that he would withdraw the executive rule in Punjab that he imposed last month, Mr. Zardari was effectively handing the province back to rule of the Pakistan Muslim League-N. Mr. Zardari is co-chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, a mantle he inherited from his wife, Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in December 2007.\nIn his speech, he said his party would support the candidate of the Pakistan Muslim League-N as chief minister, a job held by Shahbaz Sharif, the brother of the leader of the league, Nawaz Sharif, before executive rule was imposed.\nElsewhere, dozens of suspected militants fired rockets early Saturday at a transport terminal in northwest Pakistan near Peshawar, the police told The Associated Press.

{"date": "Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "The disappearance of an Air France jet en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on Sunday evening left seasoned crash investigators with a mystery to plumb and very little data to work with.\nThe Airbus A330-200, carrying 228 passengers and crew members, is believed to have vanished in a towering thunderstorm with no word from its pilots that they were in crisis.\nThe plane had beamed out several signals that its electrical systems had malfunctioned and, according to one report, that it had lost cabin pressure. The signals were sent not as distress calls, however, but as automated reports to Air France\u2019s maintenance system, and were not read for hours, until air traffic controllers realized that the plane\u2019s crew had not radioed in on schedule.\nAs a search for wreckage began over a vast swath of ocean between Brazil and the African coast, experts struggled to offer plausible theories as to how a well-maintained modern jetliner, built to withstand electrical and physical buffeting far greater than nature usually offers, could have gone down so silently and mysteriously.\nThere were no suggestions on Monday that a bomb, a hijacking or sabotage was to blame. Whatever of the plane\u2019s final minutes was recorded in its black box may never be known, because it is presumably at the bottom of the Atlantic. As is common with trans-ocean flights, it was too far out over the sea to be tracked on land-based radar from Brazil or Senegal. Whether its location was captured by satellite or other planes\u2019 radar is not known yet.\nThe plane, Flight AF 447, was scheduled to arrive at Charles de Gaulle airport at 11:10 a.m. local time. Stricken relatives descended on Terminal 2D, where the airline established a crisis center. A black-robed priest was making his way past hordes of police officers and journalists to comfort relatives of those on the flight.\n\u201cAir France is extremely distraught, and the whole team of Air France is suffering,\u201d Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the chief executive of Air France-KLM, told reporters in Paris. \u201cWe would like to say to the relatives of the victims that we are totally with them and will make every effort to help them.\u201d\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy of France said: \u201cIt\u2019s a tragic accident. The chances of finding survivors are tiny.\u201d\nThere were people of 32 nationalities aboard, including 58 Brazilians, 61 French and 2 Americans, Air France said in a statement based on information from Brazilian authorities.\nThe flight took off from Rio de Janeiro at 7:30 p.m. local time (6:30 p.m. Eastern time), and its last verbal communication with air traffic control was three hours later, at 10:33, according to a statement from Brazil\u2019s civil aviation agency. At that time, the flight was at 35,000 feet and traveling at 520 miles per hour.\nAbout a half-hour later, it apparently encountered an electrical storm with \u201cvery heavy turbulence,\u201d Air France said. The last communication from it came at 11:14 \u2014 a series of automatic messages indicating it had suffered an electrical-system malfunction. The Associated Press reported that it also suffered a loss of cabin pressure.\nBrazilian officials said the plane disappeared over the Atlantic somewhere between a point 186 miles northeast of their coastal city Natal and the Cape Verde islands off Africa. The area is known as the intertropical convergence zone, where the tropics of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres mix, sometimes creating violent and unpredictable thunderstorms that can rise to 55,000 feet, higher than commercial jetliners can go.\nExperts were at a loss to explain fatal damage from lightning or a tropical storm, both of which jetliners face routinely, despite efforts to avoid them \u2014 as much out of concern for passengers\u2019 nerves as for the planes\u2019 safety.\nPilots are trained to go over or around thunderstorms rather than through them. Brigitte Barrand, an Air France spokeswoman, said the highly experienced pilot had clocked 11,000 flying hours, including 1,100 hours on Airbus 330 jets.\n\u201cA completely unexpected situation occurred on board the aircraft,\u201d Mr. Gourgeon told France\u2019s LCI television.\n\u201cLightning alone is not enough to explain the loss of this plane,\u201d Julien Gourguechon, a longtime Air France pilot, said. \u201cTurbulence alone is not enough.\u201d\n\u201cIt is always a combination of factors,\u201d Mr. Gourgeon said. By some estimates, jetliners are typically hit by lightning at least once a year. But the strike normally travels across the plane\u2019s aluminum skin and out the tail or a wingtip. Passengers are insulated in the nonconductive, largely plastic interior, and vital equipment is shielded.\nA loss of cabin pressure could suggest a break in the fuselage, but planes are built to withstand buffeting from a storm\u2019s updrafts and downdrafts. It could also be a consequence of an electrical failure, if the plane\u2019s air compressors stop working.\nLarge hailstones created by some thunderstorms have been known to break windshields or turbine blades, though pilots would be likely to rapidly report something like that.\nThe missing aircraft was relatively new, having gone into service in April 2005. Its last hangar maintenance check was on April 16, Air France said. No Airbus A330-200 passenger flight ever had a fatal crash, according to the Aviation Safety Network.\nHans Weber, head of the Tecop aviation consulting firm in San Diego, offered a hypothesis about the episode, based on his knowledge of severe losses of altitude by two Qantas jets last year.\nThe new Airbus 330 was a \u201cfly-by-wire\u201d plane, in which signals to move the aileron, rudder and elevators are sent through electric wires to small motors rather than through cables or hydraulic tubing. Fly-by-wire systems can automatically conduct maneuvers to prevent an impending crash, but some Airbus jets will not allow a pilot to override the self-protection mechanism.\nOn both Qantas flights, the planes\u2019 inertia sensors sent faulty information into the flight computers, making them take emergency measures to correct problems that did not exist, sending the planes into sudden dives.\nIf the inertia sensor told a computer that a plane was stalling, forcing it to drop the nose and dive to pick up airspeed, and there was simultaneously a severe downdraft in the storm turbulence, \u201cthat would be hard to recover from,\u201d Mr. Weber said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/world/europe/02plane.html", "title": "Search Is On for Wreckage of Missing Air France Jet", "author": "DONALD G.

{"date": "Mon, 10 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Conflicting claims continued to swirl Monday around what has become of the Taliban leadership in Pakistan after the movement\u2019s top commander, Baitullah Mehsud, was reported last week to have been killed in an American drone strike.\nSince then, the Pakistani government and intelligence officials have asserted that a possible successor to Mr. Mehsud had been killed in a power struggle. But in a phone call on Monday, a militant disputed assertions that any leaders, including Mr. Mehsud, had been killed.\nThe back-and-forth statements underscored the difficulty of divining what is happening in the remote tribal region and in the ranks of the Pakistani Taliban leadership, which has strong links to Al Qaeda. A near complete news blackout has settled over the region, making verifying any claim almost impossible.\nBut the sweeping counterclaims of the militants were also an indicator of the stakes for the Pakistani Taliban leaders in terms of control over fighters, weapons and financing, as well as the evident stresses that the reports of Mr. Mehsud\u2019s death have placed on them.\nWhile American and Pakistani intelligence officials have not publicly confirmed Mr. Mehsud\u2019s death, they say the evidence for it is overwhelming. What is less clear is who is in charge now. On Monday, a man claiming to be Hakimullah Mehsud, the Taliban commander who Pakistani intelligence officials believed had been killed over the weekend in the power struggle, surfaced in a phone call to a news agency.\nThe caller, who contacted a reporter from Reuters, said that the government had falsely claimed he had been killed. The man also denied the death of the Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud.\n\u201cI have proven the government\u2019s claim of my death wrong and I challenge the government to prove the death of our amir,\u201d Reuters quoted the man as saying. \u201cBaitullah Mehsud is alive, safe and sound.\u201d\nBut Pakistan\u2019s interior minister, Rehman Malik, challenged those assertions. In a telephone interview late Monday, he said the government had received intelligence over the weekend that a scuffle had broken out over who would take power and that Hakimullah Mehsud, one of the candidates, had been killed.\nMr. Malik said officials were convinced of Baitullah Mehsud\u2019s death, but had not been able to confirm it formally. Information about the fight and subsequent killing came from sources in the Taliban, he said, and though they believed the intelligence to be credible, it was less certain.\nReal proof of the counterclaims, he said, would be a video.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they clearly come forward?\u201d he said. \u201cCalling from some number. The voice could be similar to others. There\u2019s something dubious going on.\u201d\nA Pakistani intelligence official said that the information about Hakimullah Mehsud\u2019s death had come from intercepted phone conversations, and that a voice analysis was being done, as three Taliban commanders had similar-sounding voices.\nThe Reuters reporter, reached by phone, said he was sure the caller was Hakimullah Mehsud.\nMeanwhile, the government is trying to enlist members of the Mehsud tribe against the Taliban. Mr. Malik met with tribal elders Monday evening and encouraged them to form a militia, elders said. But the suggestion did not appeal to them, mainly because such an action would put their families in danger and risk putting ancient tribal codes of revenge into action.\n\u201cThe interior minister said they were about to finish,\u201d said Muhammed Zaman Mehsud, a tribal elder who attended the meeting. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ll live in that area for the coming 100 decades. We simply cannot afford it.\u201d\nBesides, the tribe feels harassed by the government, which it says has arrested scores of its members, accusing them of being part of the Taliban. Some of them, the elder said, have been killed.\n\u201cThey claim they are taking action against terrorists,\u201d the elder said. \u201cBut to us, they are peaceful citizens.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/asia/11pstan.html", "title": "Leadership of Taliban in Pakistan Still Unclear", "author": "SABRINA TAVERNISE and PIR ZUBAIR SHAH"}

Medvedev replaced the governor of a northwest region on Saturday, apparently seeking to ensure that the ruling party remained in control there after it suffered a surprising defeat in local elections.\nMr. Medvedev\u2019s move in the region, Murmansk, suggested that the Kremlin wanted to clamp down quickly on hints of disloyalty among its cadre of governors as it faces possible discontent at the regional level over the financial crisis.\nThe dismissed governor, Yuri A. Yevdokimov, is a member of the ruling party, United Russia, but he had been feuding with party leaders lately. And in the mayoral election this month in the city of Murmansk, Mr. Yevdokimov supported an independent candidate, who triumphed easily over United Russia\u2019s nominee.\nThe loss in the city, which is the region\u2019s capital and has about 320,000 people, was a rebuke to United Russia. It led to a round of recriminations that reached all the way from the Murmansk region, which borders Finland and Norway, to party headquarters in Moscow.\nGovernors in Russia used to be elected, but are now appointed by the president, under a system that was put in place by Russia\u2019s paramount leader, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, when he was president in 2004. The change was widely seen as an effort by Mr. Putin to centralize power in the Kremlin.\nBut many mayors continue to be elected, and these elections have become a test of the ruling party\u2019s strength.\nAt least three well-known candidates, for example, are expected to vie next month to become mayor of the southern city of Sochi, which is to host the Winter Olympics in 2014.\nThe Kremlin announced Mr. Yevdokimov\u2019s replacement on its Web site on Saturday and, as is typically the case, the statement said he had voluntarily resigned. It seemed clear, though, that if he had not done so, he would have been dismissed.\nThe statement also said Mr. Medvedev had nominated Dmitri Dmitrienko, a senior federal fisheries official, to serve as governor.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/world/europe/22russia.html", "title": "Governor in Russia Is Ousted by Kremlin", "author": "CLIFFORD J.

Voting in the country of 9.8 million was calm.\n\u201cThis revolution, this process of change, is unstoppable,\u201d said Eugenio Rojas, a leader of the Red Ponchos, a radical group supporting Mr. Morales and formed by Aymara Indians on the high plains.\n\u201cThis is the return of the Pachakuti for us, the indigenous majority of this country,\u201d Mr. Rojas added, referring to a 15th-century Incan leader and empire builder with whom radical supporters sometimes compare Mr. Morales, an Aymara who is Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president.\nUnder a new Constitution, Mr. Morales, who has already served four years, is limited to one additional five-year term. But his strong election showing intensified debate here over whether he will seek to remove term limits, as President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez recently did in Venezuela.\nAmong Bolivia\u2019s indigenous majority, Mr. Morales\u2019s expanding power is supported broadly but not unanimously.\n\u201cNo one knows what will happen if a government attains absolute power,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Joaquino, an indigenous candidate who opposed Mr. Morales and achieved a single-digit showing in the election.\nThe preliminary results for the president and congressional candidates from his Movement Toward Socialism party also suggested greater power within his grasp. If the party secures a two-thirds majority in Congress, it could push forward changes like self-rule for indigenous areas.\nThe early results pointed to another potential area of greater strength for Mr. Morales, in the once-rebellious lowlands, where he seemed to do relatively well in two gas-rich areas, Tarija and Santa Cruz, making it easier for him to redirect petroleum revenue. Using these proceeds to increase social spending has been an important aim of Mr. Morales\u2019s government.\n\u201cEvo is our true leader,\u201d said Germana Laime de Mamani, a street vendor in El Alto who said she looked forward to receiving a monthly pension of 200 bolivianos, about $28, when she turned 60 next year.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/world/americas/07bolivia.html", "title": "Morales Headed for Re-election in Bolivia", "author": "SIMON ROMERO"}

Local television broadcast scenes of homes reduced to heaps of rubble mixed with bed frames, mattresses, furniture and bloodstained pillows. A villager cried into the camera, \u201cLook, Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. Interior Minister, where is the security that you speak about?\u201d\nThe latest wave of sectarian bombings struck northern Iraq and Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 50 people, wounding hundreds more and leveling the village, near Mosul.\nNearly 100 people in Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul have been killed in attacks since Friday, raising grave concerns about the Iraqi government\u2019s ability to maintain security.\nThe string of attacks, the most serious since June 30, when Iraqis officially took the lead on national security and American troops largely withdrew to their bases, also highlighted the underlying conflicts that continue to fuel violence. These include the rift between Arab and Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq and the continued disenfranchisement felt by many Sunni Arabs who remain unreconciled with the Shiite-led central government.\nIn the most devastating attack on Monday, a pair of large flatbed trucks packed with bombs exploded simultaneously shortly after dawn, destroying a village known as Khazna, about 10 miles east of Mosul, according to Munthir Saba, an official in Bartella, an adjacent town.\nMost villagers were asleep at the time, many of them on their rooftops in the summer heat.\nHospital officials in Mosul said at least 28 people had been killed and 155 wounded, but Mr. Saba said the casualty figures could increase because rescue efforts were continuing. Qusay Abbas, a provincial council member, put the toll at 43 dead and 220 wounded.\nThe village is inhabited mainly by Shiite Shabaks, members of a small Kurdish-speaking minority. Most are farmers and laborers.\n\u201cWe do not want a sectarian war,\u201d said the villager who bemoaned the lack of security in an interview on Mosuliya television.\nIn Baghdad, two early-morning explosions in mainly Shiite areas, one in the Amil district, the other in Shurta al Rabiaa, struck lines of workers who had gathered to look for jobs as day laborers.\nThe Amil blast went off about 5:30 a.m., killing 7 people and wounding 46. About 45 minutes later, the explosion in Shurta killed 9 and wounded 35, according to an official at the Interior Ministry who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. Both explosions were attributed to bombs in cars that had been parked in the areas for a long period of time.\n\u201cI saw three or four bodies piled up over each other,\u201d said Abu Sabah, 43, a teahouse owner in Shurta. \u201cBody parts were scattered all over. It was awful.\u201d\nLater, in neighborhoods across Baghdad, six roadside bombs, as well as a bomb placed in a minibus, were detonated. At least 3 people were killed and 23 wounded, according to the Interior Ministry official. One attack was on a popular ice cream shop in the Karada district.\nIn the evening, another car bomb in Shurta struck a kebab restaurant, killing at least 3 and wounding 18, and a roadside bomb in Adel, another Baghdad neighborhood, wounded 3, the official said.\nIn Khazna, the explosions left two large craters in different sections of the village. One was filled with water mixed with blood. Witnesses said the explosions burst the village\u2019s water main. The chassis and big wheel of what appeared to have been one of the trucks used in the attack lay atop leveled houses. In what looked like the village\u2019s main road, storefronts were ripped up, and destroyed vehicles were tossed everywhere.\nMr. Saba said the explosions happened in quick succession about 5 a.m. and shattered windows at his home in Bartella, a few miles away.\nA bulldozer shoveled debris while a crane lifted slabs of concrete to rescue people trapped underneath. Women wailed and slapped their faces in grief. Men held up photographs of loved ones and sobbed.\n\u201cTwelve members of my family are all gone,\u201d one said.\nShortly after the attack, the government of Nineveh Province issued a statement calling on Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to send military forces to the area and evict Kurdish forces from the Nineveh Plain and other parts of the province.\nIt said the attack happened because the provincial and central governments were not fully in control of the province, which is a mosaic of ethnic and sectarian groups.\nThe area has been particularly tense since provincial elections in January. A mainly Sunni Arab coalition won the elections, but Kurdish groups have refused to recognize its authority in areas they claim should be included in the nearby semiautonomous Kurdish region.\nThe sprawling, seething city of Mosul, among the most violent places in Iraq, is home to militants with ties to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the mostly homegrown insurgent group that is known to have some foreign leadership. The city is also home to insurgents linked to the Baath Party.\nMost American forces have withdrawn from posts within Mosul and are now garrisoned at a base.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/middleeast/11iraq.html", "title": "Sectarian Bombings Pulverize a Village in Iraq", "author": "SAM DAGHER"}

{"date": "Wed, 22 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 A plan to increase the American military presence on at least three military bases in Colombia, Washington\u2019s top ally in Latin America, is accentuating Colombia\u2019s already tense relations with some of its neighbors.\nVenezuela, Ecuador and Nicaragua, which are members of a leftist political alliance that is led by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela and backed by his nation\u2019s oil revenues, have all criticized the plan, saying it would broaden the military reach of the United States in the Andes and the Caribbean at a time when they are still wary of American influence in the region.\nDespite a slight improvement in Venezuela\u2019s relations with the United States in recent months, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez has been especially vocal in lashing out at the plan. Speaking on state television here on Monday night, he put Venezuela\u2019s diplomatic ties with Colombia under review, calling the plan a platform for \u201cnew aggression against us.\u201d\nColombia\u2019s foreign minister, Jaime Berm\u00fadez, on Tuesday defended the negotiations, which are expected to produce an agreement in August, asking neighboring countries not to interfere in Colombia\u2019s affairs. \u201cWe never expressed our opinion in what our neighbors do,\u201d he said, pointing to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s attempts to strengthen ties with non-Western nations. \u201cNot even when the Russian presence became known in Venezuelan waters, or with relations with China,\u201d he added.\nThe United States has been negotiating the increase of military operations in Colombia in recent weeks, faced with Ecuador\u2019s decision to end a decade-long agreement allowing E-3 AWACs and P-3 Orion surveillance planes to operate from the Manta Air Base on Ecuador\u2019s Pacific Coast.\nWhile American antidrug surveillance flights would sharply increase in Colombia, the world\u2019s top producer of cocaine, the agreement would not allow American personnel to take part in combat operations in the country, which is mired in a four-decade war against guerrillas. A limit of 800 American military personnel and 600 American military contractors would also remain in place, officials involved in the talks said.\nStill, depending on how the accord is put in place, American troop levels in Colombia could climb sharply. The United States currently has about 250 military personnel in the country, deployed largely in an advisory capacity to Colombia\u2019s armed forces, William Brownfield, the United States ambassador to Colombia, said last week.\nColombia, which has already received more than $5 billion in military and antidrug aid from the United States this decade, has found itself isolated diplomatically as Mr. Ch\u00e1vez presses ahead with his efforts to expand Venezuela\u2019s oil diplomacy while eroding American influence in the hemisphere.\nOther countries chafe at Colombia for different reasons. Colombia\u2019s diplomatic relations with Ecuador have soured since Colombian forces carried out a raid on a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, rebel camp on Ecuadoran territory last year. A festering boundary dispute with Nicaragua has also made for tensions between Colombia and Nicaragua\u2019s president, Daniel Ortega, an ally of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.\nBut with Venezuela itself, Colombia remains locked in a complex game of interdependence.\nIts sales of manufactured and agricultural goods to Venezuela remain resilient despite Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s occasional outbursts directed at his ideological opposite, Colombia\u2019s president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe. And faced with disarray in its oil industry, Venezuela relies on imports of Colombian natural gas, narrowing the possibility of a severe deterioration in ties between the two countries despite their sharply different views of cooperation with the United States.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/world/americas/23colombia.html", "title": "Increased U.S. Military Presence in Colombia Could Pose Problems With Neighbors", "author": "SIMON ROMERO"}

{"date": "Mon, 02 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PARIS \u2014 Radovan Karadzic was absent again on Monday, the third day of his trial, but he sent a letter to the chief judge of the international war crimes tribunal hearing his case saying that he would be \u201cpleased\u201d to attend on Tuesday.\nJudges have called for a hearing on Tuesday to discuss how to proceed if Mr. Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader, who is defending himself, keeps defying the tribunal and saying he is not ready for his trial.\nMr. Karadzic\u2019s stance remains that the timing of his appearance is up to him. \u201cI am continuing to work hard to prepare for my trial and look forward to making my own opening statement as soon as I am in a position to do so,\u201d Mr. Karadzic wrote in his letter, which was released Monday.\nProceeding without him, prosecutors at the tribunal, in The Hague, are laying out their case that Mr. Karadzic, who spent 11 years as a fugitive, committed genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.\nAlan Tieger, who is an American and the lead prosecutor, has cited Mr. Karadzic\u2019s own words, drawn from public speeches, telephone intercepts and video clips, as he prepared his followers for war or urged them to keep on fighting. Mr. Tieger painted a picture not of a civil war that broke out in the heat of confrontations, as is often claimed, but one that was carefully planned, with the backing of the Serbian government, to replace Bosnia\u2019s multiethnic state with a Serbs-only one.\nOne phone tap from 1991, in advance of the war, recorded Mr. Karadzic as saying that there were \u201c20,000 armed Serbs\u201d already around the city of Sarajevo. \u201cIt will be a black caldron where 300,000 Muslims will die,\u201d Mr. Karadzic went on, according to Mr. Tieger. \u201cThey will disappear. That people will disappear from the face of the earth.\u201d\nIn another recorded telephone call, an associate of Mr. Karadzic asked about Europe\u2019s reaction to a coming military campaign, to which Mr. Karadzic replied, according to the prosecutor, \u201cEurope will be told to go [expletive] itself and not to come back until the job is finished.\u201d\n\u201cThe job,\u201d Mr. Tieger said, started in 1992 as 70,000 Bosnian Serb and Serb volunteers and paramilitaries were recruited and armed. Aided by the military and the police, they swept through dozens of towns and villages, looting, killing and driving tens of thousands of non-Serbs from their homes. Many of the non-Serbs fled; others were locked up in dozens of detention camps, starved, tortured or raped, he said.\n\u201cEthnic cleansing does not appear the consequence of the war, but rather its goal,\u201d Mr. Tieger said.\nThe panel of four international judges trying the case allowed prosecutors to present their opening statement in the absence of Mr. Karadzic, or a legal representative, because the two-day summary serves as an overview of the prosecution case and does not count as evidence.\nProsecutors cut back their original indictment after judges ordered them to reduce the scope of their case. Some individual shelling and sniper-shooting events were dropped and ethnic-cleansing charges in seven municipalities were eliminated from the indictment.\nBut the prosecution has maintained the full 11 counts of crimes, and holds Mr. Karadzic accountable for what it calls four distinct criminal enterprises: the ethnic cleansing campaign in Eastern Bosnia, in which hundreds of thousands of people were driven from their homes; the 44-month siege of Sarajevo during which more than 10,000 were killed; the execution of more than 7,000 men and boys at Srebrenica; and the taking of more than 200 United Nations peacekeepers hostage.\nNumerous other trials before the court have established a multitude of facts, including that certain events happened and the identities of some of the players.\nOver what is expected to be 30 months of proceedings in Mr. Karadzic\u2019s case, the challenge for prosecutors focuses on linking him to the episodes outlined in the charges. They argue that Mr. Karadzic was the undisputed Bosnian Serb wartime leader, and that he made key political decisions and had command over the local government, the police and the military during the war. They say he instigated, ordered, sanctioned or knew of the crimes.\nCritics of the case have said its scope is still too ambitious to allow for a manageable trial. But prosecutors have resisted proposals to carve up the trial into more manageable components and say they cannot cut the indictment more without violating the verities of the Bosnian war.\n\u201cIt\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s very difficult to select among victims because that\u2019s what you do when you cut back,\u201d said Goran Sluiter, who teaches international criminal procedure at the University of Amsterdam and has advised Mr. Karadzic.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/europe/03karadzic.html", "title": "Karadzic Promises to Attend War Crimes Trial Tuesday", "author": "MARLISE SIMONS"}

It condemned Mr. Zelaya\u2019s removal as a coup and demanded his \u201cimmediate and unconditional restoration\u201d as president.\nNext, Mr. Zelaya was on to the Organization of American States in Washington and a meeting at the State Department with an assistant secretary of state.\nBack home, though, the country is sharply divided over his removal \u2014 and his record. Thousands of his opponents turned out on Tuesday to denounce him as a dictator who had been illegally scheming to subvert the Constitution by ending the one-term limit for presidents.\nThe day before, Mr. Zelaya\u2019s backers praised him as a president for the working class, intending to increase their wages as well as their political power. He had spoken of building a new Honduras, with crime and corruption in check and a better standard of living for the masses, though his administration fell well short of delivering that.\nThe bitter standoff over Mr. Zelaya is expected to reach a head Thursday, when he has vowed to return to Honduras to retake the presidency that was stripped from him after soldiers raided his home before dawn Sunday and shuttled him on the presidential plane to Costa Rica.\nA meeting of the Organization of American States continued into Wednesday morning as officials worked on a resolution to conduct a diplomatic effort to restore Mr. Zelaya to office. On the sidelines hopes were voiced that he would delay his return to allow time for such an initiative.\nDuring a news conference at the United Nations, Mr. Zelaya said that a number of other leaders had offered to escort him home, including Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, a Nicaraguan who is the president of the General Assembly; President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner of Argentina; President Rafael Correa of Ecuador; and Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza, the secretary general of the Organization of American States.\nThe interim president named by the Honduran Congress, Roberto Micheletti, has threatened Mr. Zelaya with arrest if he returns, saying he had illegally defied the Supreme Court in pushing for a referendum on changing the Constitution. Alberto Rub\u00ed, the attorney general, said Tuesday that the charges included treason and abuse of authority.\nThe newly installed foreign minister, Enrique Ortez, went further in a television interview, accusing Mr. Zelaya of permitting drug traffickers to use Honduras as a base to smuggle cocaine from South America to the United States, an accusation that aides to Mr. Zelaya called a tall tale intended to smear him.\nDismissing the notion that Mr. Zelaya\u2019s removal was a coup, Mr. Micheletti appeared before Tuesday\u2019s rally to say that elections would go ahead in November and that a new president would take office in January, when Mr. Zelaya would have been forced to step down. \u201cWe will hand over the presidential sash to whomever the people choose,\u201d he said.\nA top Zelaya aide, Enrique Flores Lanza, said Mr. Zelaya\u2019s return would put the army on the spot, forcing soldiers either to allow the man recognized by the world\u2019s governments as the rightful president of Honduras to return or to arrest him.\nWhatever they decide, Mr. Flores said, there will be huge crowds at the airport to welcome Mr. Zelaya. Mr. Flores spoke from an abandoned house in the Honduran capital, where he agreed to meet after a series of clandestine phone calls, steps he said were necessary because he was on the run to avoid arrest.\nAnother minister in Mr. Zelaya\u2019s government was similarly in hiding, although he said Mr. Micheletti himself had called him on his cellphone to say nobody was pursuing him. Until he received that in writing, the minister said, he will lie low.\nMuch remains in dispute in Honduras. Mr. Zelaya, who took office in 2006, has moved steadily to the left during his presidency, railing increasingly against the country\u2019s elite, who he says have opposed his politics of inclusion.\nCritics accuse Mr. Zelaya, who comes from a well-off family of landowners, of blatant populism and of doling out cash to try to solidify a shaky political base.\n\u201cI\u2019m O.K. with increasing the minimum wage, but he did it by more than 50 percent from one day to the next, and businesses have had to cut the payroll because of that sudden jump,\u201d said Fernando Castillo, a real estate developer who attended the anti-Zelaya protest on Tuesday. \u201cHe ended up hurting the poor.\u201d\nMr. Zelaya has spent much of his presidency holding the sort of rural chat sessions with constituents that President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has made popular in Venezuela. It is Mr. Zelaya\u2019s close relationship with Mr. Ch\u00e1vez that has caused alarm among wealthy and middle-class Hondurans.\n\u201cHe mutated,\u201d said Juan Ferrera, who served in a previous government with Mr. Zelaya. \u201cHe became someone else.\u201d\nMr. Zelaya\u2019s public support was sagging, and there was debate over whether he would have won his planned referendum, even if Congress and the courts had allowed it. But his opponents chose to act first, a decision some experts saw as a miscalculation.\n\u201cHad they let it play out, it would have been easy to stop him,\u201d said John Carey, a specialist on Latin American politics at Dartmouth University. \u201cHe seems to have triggered the only thing that could have saved him.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/world/americas/01honduras.html", "title": "After Losing Honduras, Ousted Leader Wins International Support", "author": "MARC LACEY"}
{"date": "Sun, 17 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 Eleven years ago, when she took over as president of India\u2019s oldest political party, Sonia Gandhi was seen as India\u2019s most improbable politician: a foreigner with a shaky command of Hindi, reclusive to the point of seeming aloof, a wife who had fought to keep her husband from joining politics and who lost him to an assassination.\nToday, Mrs. Gandhi, 62, is credited with having scored a stunning political coup. Her Indian National Congress party made its best performance in 25 years in the parliamentary elections completed last week, picking up 205 of 543 seats on its own, and with its coalition partners coming only 12 seats shy of an outright majority. All it needs to do now to form a government is stitch up alliances with a handful of independents and small parties.\nNo longer would it be beholden to the many small party bosses that it needed during the first five-year term a Congress-led coalition was in office. Most important, for the sake of foreign and economic policy, it would no longer have to rely on India\u2019s Communist parties to stay in power, as it had for most of that time.\n\u201cCong Gets Free Hand,\u201d screamed the front-page banner headline in The Times of India on Sunday. It featured a photograph of Mrs. Gandhi dressed in a red-ochre sari, ushering the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to a podium to address the news media.\nMeghnad Desai, an Indian-born economist and a member of the British House of Lords, went as far as to compare her to Catherine the Great, the powerful German-born empress of Russia.\nMrs. Gandhi is the Italian-born wife of the slain former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and the daughter-in-law of the prime minister before him, Indira Gandhi. She is known for rarely giving interviews, and she declined to be interviewed for this article.\nShe has said she joined politics to save the legacy of the party, which her husband\u2019s family has been associated with since before independence. \u201cI had to accustom myself to the public gaze, which I found intrusive and hard to endure,\u201d she said in a speech at the University of Tilburg in the Netherlands two years ago.\nCritics say she is simply paving the way for her son, Rahul, 38, who is expected to take a cabinet post in the new government. The party\u2019s often-slavish devotion to the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty, perhaps its biggest albatross, was evident over the weekend.\nOn Saturday evening, hours after the election results signaled the victory of the Congress-led coalition, a party leader and minister assigned to Mr. Singh\u2019s office, Prithviraj Chavan, declared on television that Mr. Gandhi could become prime minister whenever he wished. This was after Mrs. Gandhi and her son had repeatedly endorsed Mr. Singh as the party\u2019s choice for the top post.\nThe Congress landslide was all the more remarkable because it defied an Indian tradition of anti-incumbency. The Congress-led coalition, which routed the government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2004, was not only re-elected but it picked up 57 seats.\nStudents of Indian politics pointed to several factors.\nFirst, under Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s leadership, the Congress-led coalition homed in on the rural poor. During its first term, buoyed by robust economic growth, it used record government revenues to increase social spending, not just raising health and education budgets, but also starting an ambitious public works program in the countryside and a costly loan repayment waiver for farmers.\nSecond, she masterly cast herself as a leader who relinquished power, turning down her party\u2019s appeals to become prime minister, first in 2004 and again this time. Instead, she chose the soft-spoken economist, Mr. Singh, and between them, they divvied up the job: she took care of the hard-knuckles politics of keeping the coalition together, while he served as the chief executive, albeit one who was always seen as subservient.\n\u201cShe remade him,\u201d said Mr. Desai, a longtime friend of the prime minister. \u201cThis victory is as much due to him as to her. He has made dynasty palatable.\u201d\nDuring the election season, the Bharatiya Janata Party sought to portray the prime minister as weak. It accused his government of being ineffective against a spate of terrorist attacks and unable to tackle a worldwide economic crisis, which is beginning to be felt here.\nThe opposition strategy did not pay off. Its coalition trailed with 159 seats, while a third alliance, spearheaded by Communists, won fewer than 80 seats.\nEven with a free hand, the Congress-led government will face formidable challenges. India needs to swiftly build roads, highways and power plants; improve public schools and build universities for a swelling young population; and hire nurses and doctors for its feeble public health system.\nMost of all, it needs to address its abiding poverty. Despite over a decade of high economic growth in India, 300 million people remain below the poverty line. Large tracts of the country are racked by a Maoist insurgency. And for the first time in years, growth rates have dipped sharply and the deficit has ballooned.\nWhether the new administration will fast-track economic reforms, as many business leaders urge, is questionable. Congress politicians, executives and analysts are already tempering expectations.\nKapil Sibal, a Congress member of Parliament from Delhi, said in a television interview on Sunday evening that he expected the new administration to \u201csend a signal\u201d that it would advance reforms that had been stalled during the past five years but would make no \u201csudden shift\u201d in policies. It would be unrealistic to expect labor law reform in a country with no safety net to speak of, he said, or to expect a greater openness in the banking and insurance sectors in the face of the global financial crisis.\nNandan Nilekani, co-chairman of Infosys, one of the country\u2019s largest technology companies, said Sunday that the government\u2019s immediate priorities should be to raise economic growth and enact a broad set of reforms \u201cthat will widen access to both opportunities and public services.\u201d\n\u201cWe need reforms in higher education, we need reforms in empowering our cities, we need reforms in national security,\u201d he said. \u201cReforms will cover a diverse set of issues, unencumbered by allies holding them back.\u201d\nNot least, Congress will have to keep its promise to the rural poor. Mrs. Gandhi and her son, Rahul, campaigned on a pledge to expand the public jobs program and deepen food subsidies for the poor.\nMother and son face a crucial political challenge as well: how to open access to a party that critics compare to a family-owned company. Mr. Gandhi has been most explicit in calling for internal party democracy. He says he can make that kind of demand because he is a Gandhi.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/18/world/asia/18india.html", "title": "Vote in India Reshapes Landscape", "author": "SOMINI SENGUPTA"}

Several of the officials, including some who advised the government on the outbreak, said publicly that the country\u2019s former health minister, Graciela Oca\u00f1a, who resigned on Monday, had recommended postponing the vote.\nWith at least 43 fatalities, Argentina surged into third place in the world for swine flu deaths this week, passing Canada and now trailing only the United States and Mexico.\nHealth officials complained that the country had paid too little attention to the growing threat and started the epidemic with a relatively small supply of antiviral drugs and too few ventilators for seriously ill patients. The country has at least 1,580 confirmed cases of the illness.\nBrazil and Chile, whose epidemics started at roughly the same time, have had only one and 14 deaths, respectively, according to the countries\u2019 health ministries.\nThe health officials said the worsening situation in Argentina, where the Southern Hemisphere winter is taking hold, serves as a warning about the potential for swine flu to spread quickly with colder temperatures and about a lack of careful planning.\n\u201cWe are facing a grave problem here,\u201d said Dr. Jorge Yabkowski, the president of the Federation of Health Professionals of Argentina. \u201cHospitals here have very limited capacity to deal with this epidemic.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, emergency rooms that normally receive 200 patients had to attend to 1,000, and in Buenos Aires Province the minister of health, Claudio Zin, said about 40 percent of health care workers were not showing up, either because they were ill or were concerned about catching the virus. The province had called up retired doctors and medical students to help out.\nLate Wednesday, Ms. Oca\u00f1a\u2019s successor, Dr. Juan Manzur, 40, said in a statement that the government would free up more than $260 million to combat the flu and said that the government would close all schools and universities around the country starting Monday.\nArgentina\u2019s Health Ministry declined repeated requests on Wednesday to discuss the epidemic.\nThe election was considered critical to buoying flagging support for President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner. Mr. Kirchner ran for Congress in Buenos Aires Province, a move considered vital in shoring up backing for the Kirchners\u2019 party ahead of the 2011 presidential election, in which one of them was expected to run. Mr. Kirchner failed to finish first in the election, a serious blow to the pair\u2019s political future.\nMs. Oca\u00f1a could not be reached on Wednesday to confirm if she had asked that the election be delayed. A secretary in the press office at the presidential palace said Wednesday night that no press officer was immediately available to comment on health officials\u2019 criticisms of the government\u2019s decision to go ahead with the vote.\nOn Sunday, election workers wore surgical masks while voters waited in long lines in the cold.\nThe Kirchner government did not delay the vote because that would have required \u201ca political decision\u201d that was never made, Dr. Jorge San Juan, an infectious disease specialist at Hospital Mu\u00f1iz in Buenos Aires and a coordinator of the emergency health committee, said Tuesday on the radio.\nHis assertions were backed up by Dr. Hugo Amor, president of the Association of Health Professionals in Buenos Aires Province.\n\u201cWe asked last week for the country to declare a national state of emergency, but for political reasons this was not done,\u201d Dr. Amor said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThat may have been a costly decision.\u201d\nThe latest deaths included a boy and three other children from the same school and a 37-year-old nurse from a hospital in Berazategui, on the outskirts of the city of Buenos Aires.\nDr. Jarbas Barbosa da Silva Jr., chief of disease control for the Pan American Health Organization, said doctors needed to be told that patients with serious symptoms needed to be put on Tamiflu within the first 48 hours.\nBut Argentina, with a population of 40 million, has a stockpile of just 2.25 million courses of antiviral drugs, mostly Tamiflu, and some doctors say distribution has been a serious problem. The United States, with a population some seven times larger, had 50 million courses of treatment in its Strategic National Stockpile when the pandemic began.\nDr. Yabkowski and others said that Chile had been administering Tamiflu in all suspected cases to contain the virus, one reason that Chile may be experiencing fewer deaths. In Argentina, there was not enough of the drug to do that, he said.\nArgentina reported its first confirmed case of swine flu on May 7, an Argentine tourist who returned from Mexico in April.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/world/americas/02argentina.html", "title": "Argentines Question Vote During Outbreak", "author": "ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO and DONALD G.

But it has been under Western pressure to combat terrorism since 15 of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were found to be Saudi citizens.\nOsama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, is also a Saudi national although the authorities stripped him of his passport in the 1990s.\nAbdulrahman Alhadlaq, a Saudi Interior Ministry official, told The Associated Press that Amnesty International\u2019s assertions were \u201cclaims that have to be proven.\u201d\n\u201cOur policies on human rights are very clear and the orders given are for prisoners to be treated with respect and according to international human rights principles,\u201d he said, according to The A.P.\nIn the 69-page report, Amnesty said that since Sept. 11, 2001, \u201cand in the wake of a series of attacks by armed groups and individuals inside Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Arabian authorities have imposed a range of counterterrorism measures that have worsened what was already a dire human rights situation.\u201d\n\u201cCombined with longstanding and severe repression of any perceived dissent and an extremely weak human rights institutional framework, these measures have swept aside embryonic legal reforms and left people in Saudi Arabia almost completely devoid of fundamental freedoms and protection of their human rights,\u201d the report said.\n\u201cOld and new laws prescribe harsh and cruel punishments for terrorism-related offenses, including beheading and flogging, yet they are so vaguely written that they can be, and are, used to punish and suppress expression and activities that are recognized and protected as legitimate the world over,\u201d it added.\nIn July 2007, it said, the Saudi Interior Ministry \u201creported that 9,000 security suspects had been detained between 2003 and 2007 and that 3,106 of them are still being held.\u201d\nThe detainees include \u201cprisoners of conscience, targeted for their peaceful criticism of government policies\u201d but \u201cthe majority are suspected supporters of Islamist groups or factions opposed to the Saudi Arabian government\u2019s close links to the United States and other Western countries,\u201d the report said.\nIn a statement, Malcolm Smart, an Amnesty International official, said: \u201cThe abuses take place behind a wall of secrecy. Detainees are held with no idea of what is going to happen to them.

Mike Mullen, and the special envoy to the region, Richard C. Holbrooke, at his side, the minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, said: \u201cWe did talk about drones, and let me be very frank: there is a gap between us.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe bottom line is the question of trust.\u201d\nIn another sign of new strains in the relationship, the head of Pakistan\u2019s intelligence service, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, refused to meet separately with Mr. Holbrooke and Admiral Mullen, who had requested a meeting, according to Pakistani officials and an American official, who sought anonymity because he did not want to further damage relations.\nGeneral Pasha did attend a meeting with the two Americans and Pakistani military\u2019s chief of staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, according to a statement issued by the press arm of the Pakistani Army after Mr. Holbrooke and Admiral Mullen left Islamabad for India on Tuesday night.\nMr. Qureshi singled out the issue of the remotely piloted aircraft armed with missiles that the United States used against Al Qaeda\u2019s havens in the tribal areas adjacent to Afghanistan.\nBut senior Pakistani military and intelligence officers have also been deeply rankled by a public suggestion almost two weeks ago by Mr. Holbrooke and the head of Central Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, that the powerful Pakistani intelligence agency was still supporting Taliban fighters who cross into Afghanistan to attack American troops.\nMr. Holbrooke and Admiral Mullen arrived in Pakistan Monday night for a one-day visit during which they planned to elaborate on the details of the new strategy laid out by President Obama to eliminate Qaeda sanctuaries in Pakistan.\nAt a news conference at the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Qureshi raised his voice to admonish the two Americans. \u201cThe terms of engagement are very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will engage with mutual trust and mutual respect, and that is the bottom line.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe can only work together if we respect each other and trust each other.

It is the first capture of a senior Taliban figure to be officially announced by the Pakistani authorities.\nThe announcement appeared to be timed for the eighth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon, and to impress the Obama administration with the seriousness of the military endeavor here in Swat.\nThe Pakistani Army began an offensive in Swat in May, saying that Taliban militants had taken advantage of a February peace deal to establish control over much of the territory. The operation has drawn compliments from senior American commanders, who are now urging their Pakistani counterparts to extend their operations to Waziristan. Taliban in those border areas cross into Afghanistan to fight NATO-led forces, the Americans say.\nMr. Khan was arrested along with Mahmood Khan, a less senior commander, and three others, said the statement by Inter Services Public Relations, the press department of the Pakistani military.\nThe statement did not say when Mr. Khan was arrested. There were some suggestions from officials that the arrest took place some days ago, and that the announcement was delayed for the 9/11 anniversary.\nA senior Pakistani military officer said Mr. Khan was captured with five other militants six days ago in Tilgram, northeast of Mingora. The officer said that the men were transferred to Rawalpindi, the army\u2019s headquarters, and that the announcement of the arrests was delayed because the prisoners were giving valuable intelligence.\nBut an account published Friday in The News, a prominent English-language daily newspaper based in Karachi, said Mr. Khan was arrested eight days ago after he and four other men were lured to Islamabad by the military under the pretext of talks over how Swat would be governed.\nThe trap succeeded because the Taliban had indicated that they preferred to deal with the military rather than representatives of the civilian government. The goal of the Taliban, according to the account in The News, was to negotiate an agreement that would allow the restoration of Islamic religious rule in Swat as well as the army\u2019s withdrawal.\nMr. Khan, unlike most members of the Taliban, speaks English reasonably well with an American accent, having spent several years in the United States. He was deported from America after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\u201cHe was the one who was very polite, not harsh,\u201d said Rashid Iqbal, editor of the daily newspaper Chaand, published here. Mr. Khan was not religious or particularly interested in Islam, Mr. Iqbal said. \u201cIt was only power.\u201d\nMr. Khan\u2019s arrest comes after complaints from civilians in Swat that the top leaders of the Taliban remain at large. More than a million residents were ordered to leave Swat before the military offensive in May, and they endured more than two months in miserable conditions in camps for the displaced in North-West Frontier Province. They started returning in mid-July to find the Taliban gone from Swat\u2019s main town, Mingora, but its leadership apparently still intact.\nThe whereabouts of the leader of the Swat Taliban, Maulvi Fazlullah, is not known, military officials say. Ibn Amin, who terrorized the area of Matta, a Taliban stronghold, also remains at large, residents say.\nMuslim Khan worked as a house painter in the United States and spent the 1990s in Kuwait, said Sher Shah, who owned a pharmacy in rural Swat where Mr. Khan once worked.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/world/asia/12pstan-.html", "title": "Pakistan Says It Has Seized Taliban Spokesman", "author": "JANE PERLEZ and PIR ZUBAIR SHAH"}

Mr. Wen said in a news conference in Beijing on Friday that China was willing to hold further talks with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, as long as he renounced what Chinese officials consider to be separatism.\nThe Dalai Lama has long advocated genuine autonomy rather than secession for Tibet, though the Chinese government accuses him of inciting separatist violence.\nLast week, the Dalai Lama, using unusually harsh language, said China\u2019s violent policies in Tibet had transformed the mountain enclave into a \u201chell on earth.\u201d\nIn the statement released Saturday, the Tibetan cabinet, the Kashag, underscored the Dalai Lama\u2019s rejection of independence for Tibet.\n\u201cOn many occasions, His Holiness the Dalai Lama has reiterated that he is not seeking separation from the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d the cabinet said. \u201cThe Chinese premier\u2019s allegations of His Holiness the Dalai Lama seeking separation is far from the truth.\u201d\nThe cabinet said the Dalai Lama\u2019s position, laid out in a memorandum to Chinese officials last October, sought \u201cgenuine autonomy\u201d based on rights enshrined in the Chinese Constitution. But Chinese officials reacted negatively to the memorandum, with one senior official saying the Dalai Lama intended to split Tibet from China, reinstate a theocracy and carry out \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Han Chinese.\nThat reaction effectively ended, after eight rounds, a series of talks between China and the Dalai Lama, who lives in Dharamsala, India. The new statements indicated that both sides were still open to dialogue, though Tibetan officials in India insisted that the October memorandum be the starting point.\n\u201cThe memorandum clearly outlines the aspirations of the Tibetan people strictly within the constitutional principles of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d the Kashag said. \u201cPremier Wen Jiabao appears to be trying to avoid acknowledging this document by referring to some past statements of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.\u201d\nSaturday was the anniversary of ethnic riots last year in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, after protests by monks commemorating a failed uprising in 1959 were suppressed by security forces.\nThe Chinese government has locked down the Tibetan regions of western China.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/world/asia/16tibet.html", "title": "Tibet Cabinet Says Talks With China Are Welcome", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

Until now, White House advisers have said they expect Mr. Obama to make his decision by late October or early November.\nIn an interview with CNN, Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Karzai that \u201cI think one can conclude that the likelihood of him winning a second round is probably pretty high.\u201d She also said that Mr. Obama would make his decision \u201con his own timetable\u201d and not link it to the election results.\nAfghan and American officials say they expect an Afghan election commission to announce Saturday that Mr. Karzai received less than 50 percent of the vote in the Aug. 20 election, which was marred by widespread evidence of fraud and ballot-stuffing for Mr. Karzai. Based on those results, a runoff would be required under the Afghan Constitution.\nAfghan and American officials say it is imperative that the second election occur by early November, before cold weather closes roads, making voting impossible before the spring. Even so, officials say that preparing for an election in such a short time will be extraordinarily difficult.\nMr. Obama has another meeting scheduled for late next week to discuss whether to send more troops. An administration official said that more meetings were anticipated for the following week.\nMr. Karzai\u2019s main challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, hinted this week that he might be willing to enter into a power-sharing agreement with Mr. Karzai, and Mr. Karzai\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Said Tayeb Jawad, did not reject the idea. But it is unclear if such a deal would be allowed under the Afghan Constitution.\nThe Obama administration has grown increasingly dispirited about what it sees as the many failures in Mr. Karzai\u2019s government, and has spent large parts of its meetings debating whether it would make more sense to focus on building up a stronger relationship with the country\u2019s regional leaders.\nMrs. Clinton told CNN that Mr. Obama was looking at \u201chow we can have a different and more effective relationship with the Afghanistan government, whoever is the final victor, but not only with the government in Kabul, but with governors throughout the country, with what they call subnational, regional, local leaders. And there\u2019s been a lot of thought given as to how we would do that.\u201d\n4 U.S. Soldiers and 2 Afghans Die\nTwo American soldiers were instantly killed and two others died of their wounds after their patrol vehicle hit a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan, military officials said Friday.\nThe explosion took place on Thursday, but no other information was released, pending notification of family members, said Lt. j.g. Tommy Groves, a spokesman for the American forces.\nIn a separate episode, an Afghan woman and a child were killed in cross-fire in southeastern Afghanistan during an operation to find militants, the international forces in Afghanistan said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/world/asia/17karzai.html", "title": "White House Sees Victory for Karzai in a Runoff", "author": "ELISABETH BUMILLER"}

{"date": "Sun, 08 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KARBALA, Iraq \u2014 On battered blast walls and rusted telephone poles, the election posters that line the rubble-strewn road from Baghdad to Karbala show the familiar faces of the would-be leaders of Iraq.\nAlready withered and peeling, the posters are the physical traces of the Jan. 31 elections, where national leaders, including Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, backed local candidates in an effort to solidify their power bases.\nYousef Majid al-Habboubi was not among those favored with an endorsement.\nYet Mr. Habboubi, a former Baath Party member who has largely been out of politics since the American invasion in 2003, managed to defeat soundly not only candidates from the religious parties that controlled Karbala Province, but also Mr. Maliki\u2019s preferred candidates, gaining nearly twice as many votes as his two closest competitors.\nIn one respect, Mr. Habboubi\u2019s victory is a reflection of how dominant an issue reconstruction and the restoration of basic government services have become.\nKarbala is dominated by religious Shiites and is home to some of their holiest shrines. Yet the votes here seemed driven more by a desire for pragmatism than piety, going to Mr. Habboubi, a secularist with government experience, over the religious parties that have held sway here since the American invasion.\nEven more noteworthy here in Shiite country, which greatly suffered under Saddam Hussein\u2019s Baathist rule, was the willingness to turn to a man with a Baathist past. Despite that, voters interviewed said Mr. Habboubi was an overwhelmingly better candidate because of his experience as a deputy governor and his recent activities in local government.\nBorn in Najaf, Mr. Habboubi worked in the 1970s at a firehouse in Karbala, and even as he ascended the Baathist ranks he maintained a reputation as a populist.\n\u201cHe sold his own car to help restore Ahmed bin Hashim shrine,\u201d recalled Mohammad Abdul Hassan, 35, a firefighter in Karbala.\nMr. Habboubi has not been reachable for comment since his victory. Some residents speculated that he might be in hiding, after weeks of rumors that the powerful interests he opposed had put him on a hit list or that he had actually been shot.\nThis, oddly, was taken as a good sign among the people who voted for him \u2014 the logic being that someone worth being killed may be someone capable of battling corruption and entrenched interests.\n\u201cIt was a great boost for him,\u201d said Ali Hussein, 24, the sales manager at a medical supply company.\nSince Mr. Habboubi had no list of candidates and could not fill all the seats he seemingly won, there is speculation that he may be negotiating with either the religious parties or Mr. Maliki\u2019s Dawa Party to share power. There are 28 seats on the provincial council. Mr. Habboubi won 14 percent of the vote, according to a preliminary count, and the next two closest parties won 8 percent each.\nIf Mr. Habboubi does manage to exercise a degree of control in Karbala, it will return him to a position he held before the war, when he was a deputy governor under Sabbr al-Dori, an appointee and confidant of Mr. Hussein.\nMr. Dori, who worked in intelligence in the Hussein government and was one of the people on the Americans\u2019 most-wanted list before the war, was tried and sentenced to life in prison for crimes he committed while in power, according to a local official, Sheik Ahmed Jabbar.\nBut Mr. Habboubi always maintained a strong reputation with the overwhelmingly Shiite population, he said.\n\u201cHe never caused problems for the people,\u201d Sheik Jabbar said in his office in downtown Karbala, sipping a can of orange soda as he sat in front of an enlarged photo of Miami harbor.\nMr. Habboubi, while viewed as a secularist, is perhaps best known here for creating four parks linking Karbala\u2019s holy shrines, often working on the project himself.\nDuring the invasion, he bolstered his reputation by returning to the firehouse where he once worked. \u201cHe came here as a supervisor to take care of the employees and he never left his position,\u201d said Mr. Hassan, the firefighter.\nA group of tribal leaders approached him after the invasion and asked him to resume his old duties, which he did, until being ushered out of office several months later by the militias that seized control of the city.\nSince then, associates said, Mr. Habboubi has mainly worked municipal jobs.\nBut he takes enormous pride in the city and the province, with roughly one million residents, and when elections were announced, he put his name in with some 1,200 other candidates.\nSheik Jabbar, 55, who also ran in the election but lost, said he believed that Mr. Habboubi was himself surprised by how well he did.\n\u201cThe influence of the religious parties has been reduced,\u201d Sheik Jabbar said. \u201cPeople looked at the terrible conditions and decided, \u2018They have not done anything for me, so why should I vote for them?\u2019 \u201d\nThe result is all the more surprising since Mr. Maliki, whose Dawa Party otherwise had a strong showing across the country, is from the Karbala region.\n\u201cPrime Minister Maliki took care of security all over Iraq,\u201d said Khalid Ali Abbas, 55. People were grateful for that, he said, adding that he might support the prime minister in a national vote.\n\u201cBut in these elections, Mr. Maliki himself was not the focus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus was on the candidates he supported and can they do the job or not.\u201d\nThe job, as Mr. Abbas sees it, is getting basic services working, the streets cleaned, the roads paved and bridges built.\n\u201cHabboubi, he will stop in his own car and pick up trash,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/world/middleeast/09karbala.html", "title": "A Secularist Finds Sway in a Hub of Shiite Islam", "author": "MARC SANTORA"}

After a quick exchange, he hung up the phone and politely announced that his friend was actually a government minder who would soon be arriving to guide the would-be clients away from any potential trouble.\nThe destination his \u201cfriend\u201d had in mind? The airport, where the reporters, subject to a ban on foreign journalists, would be escorted onto the next flight out of town.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Ali said as the journalists prepared to flee in a taxi. \u201cBut if I didn\u2019t make that call, I would get in big trouble.\u201d\nKashgar, the ancient Silk Road oasis and backpacker lure, has been besieged by fear since ethnic rioting about two weeks ago claimed at least 197 lives in Urumqi, the capital of this northwestern expanse known as the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. Although the two cities are separated by about 700 miles of punishing desert and snow-draped mountains, the authorities are especially anxious about potential unrest in Kashgar, a city of 3.4 million that is 90 percent Uighur, a Muslim minority that has long had a mercurial relationship with the Han Chinese who govern Xinjiang.\nThe authorities have good reason to be skittish. Last August, at least 16 military police officers were killed in an attack here, unnerving the government just as dignitaries and athletes were arriving in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics. The police called it a terrorist strike by two Uighur men armed with explosives and machetes, though some witnesses later challenged that version of events.\nIn the early 1990s, Kashgar was also the scene of bombings and demonstrations; at least 21 people were killed and thousands were arrested during one particular army crackdown. The city has long been a crucible for Uighur self-determination, even if nationalist aspirations were never the same after a Chinese warlord vanquished the newborn East Turkestan Republic, a short-lived nation that called Kashgar its capital for a few months in 1933.\nAlthough it is rapidly being bulldozed in the name of modernization, Old Kashgar and its ancient dusty warrens remain the heart of Uighur culture and a beguiling draw for tourists. To China\u2019s leadership, however, the city is also an incubator for those seeking to create a Uighur homeland by the borders of Pakistan, Afghanistan and a handful of other predominantly Muslim countries whose names end with \u201cstan.\u201d\nThis time around, Kashgar has been relatively quiet. During the turmoil in Urumqi, a crowd of 200 people tried to protest outside the city\u2019s Id Kah Mosque, the largest in China, and were quickly dispersed by the police.\nBut while journalists in Urumqi can roam with relative freedom, the few foreign reporters who made it to Kashgar were promptly hustled out of town.\n\u201cThe situation may look calm now, but it could change at any second,\u201d a local government official told Mark MacKinnon, a writer for The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, as he and his colleagues were sent to the airport.\nThe uncertainty and sense of isolation have been only magnified by the blocking of access to the Internet and shutdown of text messaging and international phone service that has severed communications in Kashgar and the entire region. The blackout has been especially challenging for export companies, banks, factory owners and academics, and some of them say they have been told that Internet and phone service will be curtailed until at least October, when China celebrates the 60th anniversary of the Communist revolution.\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting a group of Swiss tourists next week, but I have no way of knowing whether they\u2019re still coming,\u201d said one beleaguered tour operator.\nLike Urumqi, which has been flooded with soldiers since July 5, Kashgar is patrolled by young men in military camouflage, many of whom ride through the city day and night, their green army trucks draped with ostensibly calming slogans like \u201cNational Separatists Are Our Enemy.\u201d\nBut the government\u2019s most effective weapon against potential trouble is largely unseen: the neighborhood committees made up of appointed Uighur cadres and citizens who, driven by fear or ambition, are ready to do the government\u2019s bidding.\n\u201cYou have to be careful because informers are everywhere,\u201d said Ismail, a secondary school teacher who used only one name for his own safety. He said his brother had been detained after publicly criticizing plans to tear down the old mud-and-straw homes that, until recently, flanked Kashgar\u2019s historic mosque. \u201cI would not trust anyone if I were you,\u201d he said.\nHis words were not hyperbole. By late last week, hotel clerks, tour guides and taxi drivers had been instructed to be on the lookout for pesky foreign journalists. A woman employed by a state-owned tourism company told of a meeting during which her boss warned that people caught assisting reporters would lose their jobs \u2014 as would members of their immediate families.\nThe campaign appeared to be extremely effective. When his passengers asked to be taken to a rural county known for its unemployed and disaffected residents, one Uighur driver called the police and then warned other drivers against helping the passengers escape.\nAfter several close encounters with the authorities, the foreigners made it to the well-irrigated countryside that forms a lush buffer between Kashgar and the vast Taklimakan Desert stretching 590 miles to the east. In one town, a group of old men hacking at the soil spoke rapturously about the pace of modernization that had made farming, and their lives, much easier.\n\u201cWe have electricity, fertilizer and motorbikes now,\u201d one of the men said.\nLater, after some gentle prodding, the farmers allowed that life was not without difficulties. One man, pointing to a row of unfinished brick houses, said local officials had demolished the villagers\u2019 old homes and promised that the government would pay for the construction of new ones.\n\u201cThe homes they\u2019re building are half as large, and now we have to pay half their cost,\u201d he said as his neighbors nodded with disgust. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that kind of money.\u201d\nThe men continued on for a while, speaking animatedly as the tour guide\u2019s face registered a kaleidoscope of troubled expressions. Their ranting done, the guide, a graduate student best left unidentified, paused before declining to render their words into English.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s better for everyone if I just pretend I didn\u2019t hear that.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/world/asia/23kashgar.html", "title": "China Fears Ethnic Strife Could Agitate Uighur Oasis", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}
{"date": "Fri, 09 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander of American and allied forces in Afghanistan, presented his request for more troops directly to President Obama on Friday as the White House moved closer to settling on a new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nGeneral McChrystal discussed his proposal via a video feed from Kabul beamed into the Situation Room in the White House, where Mr. Obama gathered with his national security team.\nThe general\u2019s presentation offered the option of different troop levels with an analysis of the risks attached to each option, according to a senior military official.\nWhite House officials said Mr. Obama had made no decision at the three-hour meeting, his fourth so far during this review, and they announced that he would hold a fifth session with his top advisers next Wednesday to continue the discussion. Administration officials said he may be presented with proposals beyond those outlined by General McChrystal.\nThe general\u2019s request included three main options, according to people briefed on its contents. Most officials have focused on his request for 40,000 troops to avoid failure in Afghanistan, but some of them confirmed Friday an ABC News report that his maximum request outlined a troop buildup that was substantially larger than that.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that one of his options called for more than 60,000 additional troops, but several officials said the maximum variant was even larger.\nThe senior military official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said General McChrystal was concerned that some of Mr. Obama\u2019s senior advisers were arguing that the Taliban are not a direct threat to the United States.\n\u201cThe real question is, do you want the Taliban to be in power in Afghanistan?\u201d the official said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, then they have to be addressed through a counterinsurgency campaign.\u201d\nMr. Obama is coming under pressure from all sides, including liberals from his own party who oppose any additional troops and conservatives who are pressing for him to give General McChrystal whatever he wants.\nAmong those weighing in is Bruce O. Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who led Mr. Obama\u2019s first strategy review on Afghanistan and Pakistan earlier this year. In an interview Friday, he said Mr. Obama needed to make a decision soon to calm nervous allies and make clear to the Taliban that the United States cannot be driven out of Afghanistan.\nMr. Riedel also criticized as a \u201cfairy tale\u201d the notion that American forces could focus more on Al Qaeda without worrying as much about the Taliban. And he said he worried that Mr. Obama would seek some compromise that might not be workable.\n\u201cThe danger, of course, is in doing something like that is you get exactly what they don\u2019t want \u2014 the Vietnam syndrome of incrementalism,\u201d Mr. Riedel added.\n\u201cEach increment isn\u2019t enough to change the situation but gets you deeper in the hole,\u201d he said. \u201cMy recommendation to them would be to give McChrystal what he says he needs.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/world/asia/10prexy.html", "title": "Obama Hears General\u2019s Troop Request for Afghanistan", "author": "PETER BAKER"}

{"date": "Mon, 19 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "GAZA \u2014 Three young medical students were snapping photographs of a scene of devastation on Monday: five stories of mint-green, concrete rubble that until Israel\u2019s war with Hamas began had been their science lab.\n\u201cThey hit my future with a rocket,\u201d said Muhammad Baroud, one of the students at the Islamic University in Gaza City. \u201cThis is a university. What does it have to do with war?\u201d\nAs Gazans surveyed the destruction of the city on Monday, one question kept arising: Why had civilian institutions been hit? At lunch tables and in coffee shops, people listed the targets: the Ministry of Justice, Parliament, the central police station, the fire station, Islamic University.\nIsrael argues that those institutions help funnel money, supplies and people to Hamas, which it considers a terrorist organization, and for that reason they are legitimate targets in Israel\u2019s efforts to weaken the group.\n\u201cThe civilian infrastructure provides the administrative, logistical, human resources and funding structure, which supports Hamas\u2019s entire military effort,\u201d said Capt. Benjamin Rutland, a spokesman for the Israeli military.\nBut many Gazans say that the strikes, which left gaping holes and giant piles of rubble in the center of the city, felt more like an attack on them as a society, as the leveling of the institutions was a direct hit against the rule of law and the structure of the state.\n\u201cThe war was not against Hamas,\u201d said Rahmi el-Kheldi, the owner of a flower shop in central Gaza. \u201cIt was against me, my shop and my city.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cTheir aim was chaos, to disrupt society.\u201d\nFor Mr. Baroud and his friends, the bombing of the science lab building, which happened in the early days of the Israeli offensive, was a frontal attack on their future. The university is prestigious, and they said they worked hard to get there. It is one of the best medical schools in the region, and Israel recognizes its degrees.\n\u201cAre we going to study in a tent?\u201d asked Mr. Baroud\u2019s friend, Ahmed.\nBut the question of what is a legitimate military target can be tricky. An Israeli military official, citing intelligence reports and speaking on the condition of anonymity because of military rules, said that the labs functioned as research and development facilities for Hamas\u2019s homemade Qassam rockets, and that a large number of people at the university were involved. The attack was precise, the official said, with the science building\u2019s being the only one that took a direct hit.\nThose interviewed about the university on Monday strongly denied Israel\u2019s claim. Fakhr Abu Awad, a professor of chemistry at Islamic University, said that the school was a cross section of Gazan society, and that Hamas, popular in Gaza, was similarly represented there. But supporting Hamas, Mr. Abu Awad said, is a far cry from taking part in its military activities, and he dismissed the Israeli claim as almost too insulting to answer.\n\u201cThis is an academic institution, and it\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d said Mkhaimar Abusada, assistant professor of political science at Al-Azhar University-Gaza, referring to Islamic University. \u201cEven though Hamas was launching missiles against Israel, it does not mean Israel has the right to bomb civilian infrastructure.\u201d\nAhmed said, \u201cThe Israelis say there are weapons, but I\u2019ve been studying here and I never saw any.\u201d\nThe issue, in part, is about the very nature of Hamas. Gazans say that there is a range of relationships people have with the group, starting with sympathizer and ending with rocket launcher or suicide bomber. Just because someone likes Hamas does not mean that that person is necessarily working for the group, Gazans say.\n\u201cWe are sympathizers, but we have nothing to do with launching rockets,\u201d said Adam Ghabin, 21, a firefighter at Gaza City\u2019s main fire station, which has two giant craters in its complex from bombings. Hamas martyr posters were taped to the walls.\nBut many civilian jobs, like that of a police officer, for example, fall into gray areas.\nAs armed, uniformed members of a state that is run by Hamas, Israel argues, the police are legitimate targets. Abu Aymad, 52, who has worked in Gaza\u2019s police force as a prison guard since 1994, long before Hamas came to power, disagrees.\n\u201cThe police is a civil institution,\u201d he said outside the pile of rubble that once was Gaza City\u2019s central police station. \u201cIt serves the people, not the parties.\u201d\nHe points to his smoking habit as evidence that he is not a hard-core supporter of Hamas, which takes a strong Islamic line and disapproves of drinking and smoking. An attack on the police, he said, was a strike at the heart of a state ruled by law.\n\u201cThey hit the police building because they wanted to create anarchy,\u201d he said, his mustache yellow from smoking.\nA student at Islamic University who was visiting Mr. Kheldi\u2019s flower shop said, \u201cJust because Hamas is present in civil institutions doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not legitimate institutions.\u201d\nMr. Kheldi, a supporter of Fatah, Hamas\u2019s political rival, said that much of the police force was loyal to Hamas, and that even traffic police officers could help by monitoring the streets and informing the group.\nStill, the destruction felt profound and shocked even the most hardened observers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something very massive, beyond imagination,\u201d Mr. Abusada said.\nAbdel Hamid Khdair, a security guard at the Parliament building, which on Monday looked like a giant robot, its bare skeleton buckled but still standing, said: \u201cEveryone was hit by Israel this time. Education, health, life. Everything is paralyzed.\u201d\nAn Israeli official responded by saying, \u201cGiven the extensive nature of the Hamas infiltration of the civilian infrastructure,\u201d such as booby-trap bombs, \u201cdamage was unavoidable.\u201d\nMr. Baroud was unconvinced.\n\u201cI want to ask the Israelis,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy did you do this to us?\u201d\nPalestinians see the war as yet another attack on their national identity, Mr. Kheldi said. Though Israel was trying to drain support for Hamas, he said, violence will make Palestinians only more defensive.\n\u201cThey think the more they kill, the more we lose our will,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cNow, when I see a rocket fly, I hope it hits a bus. Not because I want to kill kids, but because they\u2019ve killed so many of ours.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/world/middleeast/20gaza.html", "title": "Many Civilian Targets, but One Core Question Among Gazans: Why?", "author": "SABRINA TAVERNISE"}

He was 86.\nFamily members said Captain Ahronovitch died after a long illness, The Associated Press reported.\nAn antiquated former Chesapeake Bay steamship originally known as the President Warfield, the Exodus 1947, as it was formally renamed, was acquired by the Haganah, the Jewish paramilitary organization, in 1946. The group planned to use it to transport refugees, most of them Holocaust survivors, to Palestine, then under British control.\nThe refugees had no legal authority to enter Palestine, and the British were determined to block the ship. In the battle that ensued, three Jews aboard the Exodus were killed. The ship\u2019s passengers \u2014 more than 4,500 men, women and children \u2014 were ultimately deported to Germany.\nThe attack and its aftermath, which focused attention on the plight of many European Jews after the war, made headlines worldwide and helped marshal support for an Israeli state.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Shimon Peres, the Israeli president, said Captain Ahronovitch had \u201cmade a unique contribution to the state which will never be forgotten,\u201d Agence France-Presse reported.\nThe story of the ship\u2019s thwarted journey formed the loose basis for Leon Uris\u2019s novel \u201cExodus,\u201d published in 1958. In 1960, the novel was made into a film starring Paul Newman as a character based on Yossi Harel, the overall commander of the Exodus operation. Neither book nor movie, apparently, included a character based on Captain Ahronovitch.\nMr. Harel died last year.\nYitzhak Ahronovitch, familiarly known as Ike, was born in Poland in 1923. (His family name has been rendered in news accounts over the years as Aronowicz, Aronowitz, Aharonowitz and Aharonovitz, among other spellings; his first name was sometimes given as Yehiel.) At 10, he moved with his family to Palestine.\nAs a young man, he was a member of Palmach, the Haganah\u2019s strike force, The New York Times reported in 1961. In World War II, he sailed on British and Norwegian merchant vessels.\nCaptain Ahronovitch was 23 when he took the helm of the Exodus. On July 11, 1947, he picked up the refugees at S\u00e8te, in southern France. On July 18, as the ship neared the coast of Palestine, the British Navy intercepted it. Captain Ahronovitch tried to break through, but two British destroyers rammed the ship.\nSeveral hours of fighting followed, with the ship\u2019s passengers spraying fuel oil and throwing smoke bombs, life rafts and whatever else came to hand, down on the British sailors trying to board, The Times reported at the time. Soon the British opened fire. Two immigrants and a crewman on the Exodus were killed; scores more were wounded, many seriously. The ship was towed to Haifa, and from there its passengers were deported, first to France and eventually to Germany, where they were placed in camps near L\u00fcbeck.\nAfterward, Captain Ahronovitch lived out of the limelight.

But if the deal has progressed as Guinean officials have described, it could clash with the tough positions laid out by the junta\u2019s critics, including France and the United States.\nMany nations condemned the massacre and swiftly backed away from any agreements with the military government after its soldiers fired upon protesters in a stadium in the capital, Conakry. On Tuesday, a group comprising the European Union, the African Union and the United Nations, among others, called for the junta\u2019s \u201cwithdrawal,\u201d and some of Guinea\u2019s neighbors in West Africa have threatened sanctions.\nFor the second straight day, shops, businesses and offices stayed shut in Conakry, as residents observed a call by unions to stay home to protest the killings. There was little traffic, and the city was quiet, residents said.\nMr. Kallo said the deal had been signed with a private company, not with the Chinese government. He said the company had agreed to invest \u201cup to $7 billion\u201d in electricity and aviation infrastructure \u2014 an enormous sum for a country whose gross domestic product is only $4.5 billion. Electric service in Guinea\u2019s capital is shaky at best, and the country of 10 million people, about the size of Oregon, is virtually without internal air links.\n\u201cHow the Chinese are to be compensated hasn\u2019t been decided,\u201d Mr. Kallo said.\nChina has been determined in its pursuit of minerals in Africa, often without consideration of how countries are governed, and analysts said a number of Chinese had been seen in recent months at Guinea\u2019s ministry of mines.\nThe Chinese approach has made serious headway on a continent where governments are routinely implicated in human rights violations; over the weekend, the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, praised China for \u201cinvesting in infrastructure and building roads\u201d and criticized the West for merely \u201chanding out development aid.\u201d\nMr. Kallo did not name the company involved in the agreement, but news reports have identified it as the China International Fund, which one expert described as a \u201csemi-independent operator.\u201d Mr. Kallo said the Angolan state oil company, Sonangol, was also part of the deal.\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with the current situation,\u201d Mr. Kallo said of the deal. \u201cThey came here well before the death of the former president,\u201d he said, referring to Lansana Cont\u00e9, the longtime dictator whose death last December gave rise to the military junta that rules the country.\nBut the government\u2019s sudden promotion of the agreement, an effort led by the country\u2019s minister of mines in interviews in recent days, has led analysts to say it is an attempt by the military regime to demonstrate that it is not an international pariah. State television has also repeatedly broadcast allusions to the Guinean-Chinese friendship.\nSeveral human rights leaders in Conakry said the quasi public relations offensive would be ineffective because Guineans were still angry, and grieving, over the stadium massacre.\nOne expert on Africa-China relations, David H. Shinn, a former United States ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, said \u201cthe announcement remains something of an embarrassment to China and plays into its policy of emphasizing state sovereignty and avoiding interference in governance and human rights issues in other countries.\u201d\nMr. Shinn said the deal \u201cclearly complicates the ability of those in the international community who want to put pressure on Guinea.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly the timing of this is unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, it puts Guinea in a much stronger position than it would have been.\u201d\nIn Conakry, human rights campaigners had a different view, drawing a sharply unfavorable comparison between the Chinese approach and heavy American criticism of the junta, which they said had broad popular appeal.\nThe Chinese are \u201cperceived as supporting the dictatorship and the junta and against the will of the people,\u201d said Mamadi Kaba, president of the Guinean branch of the African Assembly for Human Rights. \u201cGuineans are convinced there will never be development unless there is a lot more democracy. So the American support is much more important.\u201d\nThierno Bald\u00e9 of the Institut de Recherche sur la D\u00e9mocratie et l\u2019\u00c9tat de Droit, a Conakry good-government group, said: \u201cWhat the deal signifies is, \u2018Since the Western companies don\u2019t want to work with us, we\u2019ll turn to the Chinese and loosen the grip.\u2019\n\u201cBut people\u2019s preoccupations are definitely elsewhere now,\u201d Mr. Bald\u00e9 said. \u201cPeople are definitely more preoccupied with the killings.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/world/africa/14guinea.html", "title": "Guinea Boasts of Deal With Chinese Company", "author": "ADAM NOSSITER"}

When this city\u2019s voters go to the polls this month for parliamentary elections, they now appear likely to do the unthinkable: cast out the Liberal Democratic incumbent, a top party member whose family has held the seat for two generations.\nMatsuyama is not alone. If polls are correct, the Liberal Democrats are heading for a humiliating loss in the Aug. 30 national elections, which would knock them out of power for only the second time since the party\u2019s founding in 1955. One big reason has been the collapse of the party\u2019s traditional base in the countryside.\n\u201cThe countryside is angry,\u201d said Takayuki Miyauchi, a retired postmaster. \u201cWe want anyone but the Liberal Democratic Party.\u201d Mr. Miyauchi, 67, used to organize voters to support the party but is now campaigning against it.\nFor years, the dogged loyalty of Japan\u2019s conservative heartland kept the Liberal Democrats in power despite urban unhappiness with its chronic corruption scandals and policy bungling. Now, the party seems paralyzed by Japan\u2019s mounting problems, including the expense of supporting a rapidly aging population even as its economy continues to falter.\n\u201cWe are seeing the belated demise of the Liberal Democratic Party as we know it,\u201d said Naoto Nonaka, a political scientist at Tokyo\u2019s Gakushuin University. \u201cThe party failed to read the changing tide in Japanese politics.\u201d\nYoung people turned off by the party\u2019s colorless candidates and back-room politics are abandoning the Liberal Democrats in droves, while the aging ranks of loyal voters are inevitably thinning. At the same time the export-dependent Japanese economy has sagged badly.\nEven the construction industry, the major recipient of government largess and the most important cog in the rural patronage machine, has turned against the party as 40 percent of its companies have fallen into bankruptcy over the last decade.\nFeeling betrayed, the remaining construction companies no longer press employees to vote for the Liberal Democrats, as they once did, industry officials said, and have stopped paying party membership dues. At a recent wedding, a construction company executive even hit a local Liberal Democratic politician over the head with a beer bottle after arguing over whether to support the party.\n\u201cBefore, we were like one big family, all supporting the Liberal Democratic Party,\u201d said Takao Hoshika, chairman of the prefectural construction industry association, which still officially backs the Liberal Democrats. \u201cNow, the unity is gone.\u201d\nThe new political alignments, like the old, have intruded into everyday relationships. Postmasters in town have stopped asking customers to vote for the Liberal Democrats. So have doctors, who used to urge their patients to back the party.\nHere in Matsuyama, a relaxed city of 500,000 known for its hot springs and succulent mandarin oranges, even once die-hard elements of the Liberal Democratic machine talk of giving the opposition Democratic Party a shot at governing the country.\n\u201cThe vote machine has stopped working,\u201d said Yasuhisa Shiozaki, the Liberal Democratic incumbent. \u201cEven when a group backs us, the regular members don\u2019t follow the leader anymore.\u201d\nA former chief cabinet secretary with a Harvard education, Mr. Shiozaki, 58, is an international-minded lawmaker who was widely seen as a future leader for the party. The fact that he is now in the political fight of his life, for a district that he has won four times and that his father first won in 1969, is testimony to the size of the shift against the Liberal Democrats.\nWhile no public opinion poll has been conducted in Matsuyama, Mr. Shiozaki admits he faces an uphill fight.\nOn a recent day of campaigning, Mr. Shiozaki held town hall meetings, Japanese-style, in which members of support groups sit shoeless on tatami mats while the candidate takes questions. A glance across the room revealed one of the party\u2019s challenges: only two or three non-graying heads were present. The party seems to be aging at an even faster rate than Japanese society, members say.\n\u201cYoung people don\u2019t want to be members of the Liberal Democratic Party anymore,\u201d said Shunnosuke Shuno, 79, who leads a neighborhood chapter.\nIn Ehime, the prefecture on the rural island of Shikoku where Matsuyama is located, party membership has fallen to some 30,000, a third of its peak in 1990, because of natural attrition and members\u2019 dropping out, according to the prefectural branch.\nYasunori Nakaya, 64, who owns a women\u2019s clothing store squeezed between the pachinko parlors and karaoke shops on one of Matsuyama\u2019s roofed shopping arcades, said he remained loyal to the Liberal Democrats. But both his wife and his eldest son had switched to opposition parties. So had about half of the 100 or so shop owners on his arcade, who were solidly Liberal Democratic in the last lower house election four years ago.\nHe blames the party\u2019s failure to fix the nation\u2019s economy.\n\u201cIf we keep going like this, Japan will sink,\u201d Mr. Nakaya said.\nStill, it remains difficult for many residents in this tightly knit rural community to so openly break ranks and support the opposition.\nTakako Nagae, 49, the opposition Democratic Party\u2019s candidate for the Aug. 30 election, said that many former Liberal Democratic Party supporters, including doctors, truck drivers and laundry store owners, have been calling her offices to say that they secretly support her.\n\u201cThey back us from the shadows,\u201d said Ms. Nagae, a cheerfully charismatic former television show hostess.\nStill, Ms. Nagae had no trouble drawing a crowd at one of Matsuyama\u2019s long shopping arcades one recent morning with her message of reining in Tokyo\u2019s bureaucracy and giving more power to local governments. One listener, Sayoko Kinoshita, 72, said she was a lifelong backer of the Liberal Democrats. But in this election, she was giving the opposition serious consideration.\n\u201cMs. Nagae says such good things. I want to take these 40 days to consider both sides,\u201d she said, referring to the days then remaining until the election.\nIndeed, the apparent success of Ms. Nagae\u2019s photogenic style underscores an underlying sea change in Japanese politics that could also help decide this election: a shift toward campaigns driven by popular appeal instead of political patronage.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important now is making direct appeals via the TV,\u201d said Minoru Shinohara, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s Ehime prefectural chapter. \u201cThe vote-gathering machines are becoming a thing of the past.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/world/asia/06japan.html", "title": "Eroding Rural Base Threatens to Topple Japanese Party\u2019s Long Rule", "author": "MARTIN FACKLER"}

The North has adopted a bellicose stance toward all United Nations actions, firing off batches of missiles to thumb its nose at the threat of additional penalties.\n\u201cThis is probably not enough for a major North Korea response,\u201d David C. Kang, a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California, said by telephone from Seoul. \u201cIt will hurt them in any attempt to sell weapons, so as a restraint it might be good. But in terms of getting them to change their behavior, I don\u2019t believe that is going to happen.\u201d\nThe country\u2019s belligerent attitude has been linked to the question of who will succeed Kim Jong-il, the leader who is visibly ailing. South Koreans are debating whether a transition to one of Mr. Kim\u2019s sons would bring new calm or renewed challenges to the outside world, Professor Kang said.\nWestern diplomats said the new sanctions were determined by consensus among the Council\u2019s 15 members, with some horse-trading, particularly with China, North Korea\u2019s most important trading partner and ally. The Council will investigate other companies and individuals.\nThe sanctioned companies are the Namchongang Trading Corporation, linked to purchases of pumps, aluminum tubes and other materials used in uranium enrichment; Hong Kong Electronics, which has transferred millions of dollars for Tanchon Commercial Bank; the Korea Hyoksin Trading Corporation, involved in the development of nuclear and other weapons; the General Bureau of Atomic Energy, which runs the nuclear program; and the Korean Tangun Trading Corporation, which buys much of the military research materials.\nThe sanctioned individuals are Yun Ho-jin, director of Namchongang Trading; Ri Je-son, director of the atomic energy bureau; Hwang Sok-hwa, chief of science at the bureau; Ri Hong-sop, former director of the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center; and Han Yu-ro, head of another trading company involved in the ballistic missile program.\nThe goods subjected to a trading ban are a special kind of graphite and a Kevlar filament or tape, which an American official said were used in rockets.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/world/asia/17nations.html", "title": "U.N.

He inherits crises with Iran and North Korea, as well as the weakening of the global security system meant to curtail the spread of nuclear weapons.\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran\u2019s president, greeted Mr. Amano\u2019s first day in office with a defiant threat. \u201cFriendly relations with the agency are over,\u201d he told a television interviewer in Iran late Tuesday. He also declared that Tehran had no duty to tell the United Nations agency about its plans to build nuclear sites unless it used imported technology.\nThe I.A.E.A. has no such rule regarding imported technology. But if Mr. Ahmadinejad meant that Iran would tell the I.A.E.A. nothing about the plans it announced Sunday for building 10 enrichment plants, that silence would pose a major diplomatic test of Mr. Amano\u2019s short tenure.\nMr. Amano seemed to anticipate Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s remarks when he spoke to staff members in Vienna earlier on Tuesday at the outset of his four-year term. \u201cThe situation surrounding the agency is stormy now,\u201d he said, according to a statement posted on the agency\u2019s Web site. \u201cWe have a lot of difficult challenges, but I would like to do my best.\u201d\nHe pledged to fight the proliferation of nuclear arms, to enhance nuclear security and to provide a sound basis for nuclear energy. \u201cI will try to be an impartial, reliable and professional director general,\u201d he added.\nMr. Amano is the first Asian to lead the agency and comes from the only nation ever attacked with nuclear arms. Born two years after the end of World War II, he grew up as his country wrestled with the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nAfter being elected in July, he alluded to that experience and pledged to work hard to battle nuclear proliferation. \u201cAs a national coming from Japan,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll do my utmost to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\u201d He has extensive experience in disarmament and nonproliferation diplomacy, as well as nuclear energy issues.\nMr. Amano takes the agency\u2019s helm from Mohamed ElBaradei, 67, an Egyptian-born lawyer who served in the post for 12 years and recently acted as the West\u2019s representative in negotiations with Iran to have it export the majority of its enriched uranium for processing into reactor fuel.\nIn an interview last month, Dr. ElBaradei called the global system for nuclear security \u201ca mess,\u201d saying events were undermining authorities and promoting crises and dangerous proliferation trends.\nThe Vienna agency, which has about 2,200 professional and support staff members from more than 90 nations, wears two hats \u2014 both promoting and regulating the global development of civilian nuclear industries, including nuclear power. Its most conspicuous role is that of atomic police officer. Its teams of inspectors fan out around the globe to try to discern if governments are breaking their commitments to the peaceful declarations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by secretly turning civilian nuclear complexes to military ends and the making of atomic bombs.\nThe agency\u2019s biggest challenge currently is Iran, where a crisis that began seven years ago \u2014 over two secret nuclear projects that the West suspected were aimed at making fuel for weapons \u2014 has recently veered into new confrontations.\nOn July 2, Mr. Amano was elected director general after repeated failures to win the necessary two-thirds vote from the agency\u2019s 35-nation board of governors. The breakthrough vote came after an unidentified country changed its vote from no to an abstention.\nHis chief rival was Abdul Samad Minty, South Africa\u2019s representative to the agency. Mr. Minty was supported by developing states that were worried that the world\u2019s existing nuclear powers would seek to limit their access to atomic technologies.\nMr. Amano led the board of governors from September 2005 to September 2006. Before that, at the Japanese Foreign Ministry, he worked as director general for the disarmament, nonproliferation and science department.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/world/middleeast/02nuke.html", "title": "New Chief Takes Charge at the U.N.

Since then, tens of thousands of members of the security forces have been purged, and the Iraqi Army and police have struggled to regain public confidence as the American military presence recedes.\nBut in the past two weeks, there have been two attacks by men wearing Iraqi Army uniforms that have revived the specter of the death squads, stirring concern at the highest levels of the Iraqi and American commands.\nBefore dawn on Wednesday, men dressed in Iraqi Army uniforms stormed a house in a small village north of Baghdad, rounded up six members of a family, including women and children, and killed them, Iraqi officials said. The attack occurred nine days after men dressed in Iraqi Army uniforms raided a house near the Abu Ghraib district of Baghdad Province and killed 13 civilians.\nDetails of both episodes remain murky, with relatives, local officials and government security officials giving different accounts of the motivations of the attackers \u2014 and their theories often break along sectarian lines.\n\u201cWe are witnessing the return of the death squads,\u201d said Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi after the first attack.\nMr. Hashimi is engaged in a bitter struggle over a proposed election law that he has maintained disenfranchises Sunni voters, a fight that has largely occurred along sectarian lines and threatens to delay the first national elections in four years.\nThe political wrangling, which has left Sunnis feeling increasingly disenfranchised, is raising concerns that it could fuel a parallel rise in sectarian violence.\nBoth attacks occurred in areas that were once strongholds for Sunni insurgents, and all of the victims were Sunnis. There has been concern that militants are trying to regain a foothold in the areas around Baghdad to step up attacks before the elections, which were expected to be held in January.\nOne theory about the attacks is that militants are posing as members of the army to foment distrust among Sunnis, turning them against government troops, and in that way making it easier to establish havens. The government, however, has provided no evidence to this effect and the theory is based on little more than speculation by local security officials, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity.\nThe official statements from the Shiite-led government have been subdued, saying only that the killing of the 13 civilians resulted from \u201ctribal disputes\u201d and offering no immediate comment on Wednesday\u2019s killings.\nWhen asked about the earlier attack, Gen. Ray Odierno, the commander of American forces in Iraq, said that Americans were involved in the investigation and that several suspects had been detained.\n\u201cThere are several different theories why that happened,\u201d he said at a news conference last week. The suspects could be \u201csome people who at one time were picked up for working with Al Qaeda and have since been released and went after the security forces that arrested them.\u201d\n\u201cThere is also a theory that it could be tribal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to work our way through.\u201d\nSpeaking about the attack on Wednesday, witnesses told local police officers that men in army uniforms stormed a house in Tarmiya, 20 miles north of Baghdad, shortly before dawn.\nThe assailants then killed six members of the family, according to a local police official, who said the victims\u2019 throats were slit. An official at police headquarters in Baghdad confirmed the number of dead but said the victims had been shot.\n\u201cThese people are terrorists and they wore the Iraqi Army uniforms to make the government look bad,\u201d said a local police commander, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak with reporters. \u201cThis has nothing to do with sectarian issues.\u201d\nThere were other attacks across Iraq on Wednesday, including two bombings in the Shiite holy city of Karbala that killed three people and wounded at least 36 others.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/world/middleeast/26iraq.html", "title": "In Iraq, 2 Attacks Raise Fears of Sectarianism", "author": "MARC SANTORA"}

The guilty verdict and sentence, which he will serve in a secure psychiatric facility, brought to a close a sensational tale of incest in a homemade basement dungeon that horrified but riveted the world.\nMr. Fritzl, 73, was found guilty on all counts, including rape, incest, imprisonment and enslavement.\nBut it was the charge of negligent homicide that carried the highest sentence. Prosecutors demanded the maximum sentence before the eight-member jury retired to deliberate. The verdict was unanimous.\nTelevised images from the courthouse in St. P\u00f6lten, Austria, showed Mr. Fritzl displaying no emotion as he was led out of the courtroom by guards. Mr. Fritzl\u2019s lawyer, Rudolf Mayer, said that his client would not appeal the ruling and that it was \u201cthe logical consequence of his guilty plea.\u201d\nTwo days after refusing to take responsibility for his newborn son\u2019s death, Mr. Fritzl abruptly reversed himself on Wednesday and pleaded guilty to all counts against him, including negligent homicide and enslavement.\nThe crime began a quarter-century ago when Mr. Fritzl locked his daughter in the basement of the apartment house where the family lived. Over the course of the 24 years in which he held her in captivity in the windowless cellar, Mr. Fritzl repeatedly raped his daughter, who gave birth to seven children.\nA twin boy who died shortly after he was born became a focal point of the legal proceedings.\nUnder Austrian law, sentences are served concurrently and not consecutively.\nIt is unlikely that Mr. Fritzl will ever be freed, but it remains at least a possibility.\n\u201cHe could theoretically be released after 15 years at the earliest, and then of course three judges would have to decide again about his release,\u201d said Franz Cutka, a court spokesman, speaking through an interpreter at a news conference.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/world/europe/20austria.html", "title": "Life Sentence in Austria Incest Case", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH"}

For now, their answer seems to be a wide-ranging campaign by officials to investigate ministers on corruption charges and push for their ouster.\nThe electoral success of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\u2019s party in January\u2019s provincial elections seemed to stem in large part from the perception, which he promoted vigorously, that he had brought security and rule of law to Iraq. Since then, Mr. Maliki has been promising to fight corruption and bring about a significant government shake-up.\nThe urgency comes in part from a corruption investigation into the Trade Ministry. Nine officials, including two of the trade minister\u2019s brothers, have been charged, and the minister, Falah al-Sudani, is being investigated.\nMr. Sudani, faced with the almost certain prospect of a no-confidence vote in Parliament, has agreed to offer his resignation, lawmakers said. Mr. Maliki would still need to accept the resignation, and even if he did, it would not stop the criminal investigation, they said.\nBut the Trade Ministry is apparently only the beginning. The next target, several members of Parliament said, was Hussain al-Shahristani, the oil minister, who has come under intense criticism over the financial management of his ministry, the sluggishness of development in Iraq\u2019s oil sector and the decline in oil exports.\nLawmakers said last week that Mr. Shahristani had been summoned to appear before Parliament to answer to charges of mismanagement in his ministry. But Assem Jihad, a spokesman for the Oil Ministry, denied that. \u201cIf it happens, the minister will be ready to attend,\u201d he said.\nSeveral lawmakers rattled off a list of other ministers who they say are being investigated or are likely to be called to appear before Parliament. Each lawmaker seems to have a different list, perhaps illustrating the intensely political nature of such a campaign.\nSeparately, American officials said Saturday that a rocket had landed just north of the American Embassy around 8:15 p.m. on Friday, killing the contractor. Officials declined to provide further details, but after several months of relative quiet, Western officials who live in the Green Zone have said, there has recently been an increase in mortar and rocket attacks, sometimes several a week.\nThe other civilian who was killed, James Owen Kitterman, 60, also a contractor, was found Friday.

{"date": "Mon, 22 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "Ralf Dahrendorf, a German sociologist whose experiences in Nazi Germany led him to develop a theory of liberalism and human freedom that often went against the grain of German politics in the postwar period, died Wednesday in Cologne. He was 80.\nHis death was confirmed in a statement from Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said, \u201cEurope has lost one of its most important thinkers and intellectuals.\u201d The cause was cancer, said his wife, Dr. Christiane Dahrendorf.\nDemocracy and its problems preoccupied Mr. Dahrendorf for his entire career as a scholar and as a politician in West Germany in the 1960s and 1970s. As a high school student he had been imprisoned by the Nazis for spreading leaflets opposing the regime, and early in his life he developed a deep suspicion of what he called \u201cclosed, encompassing systems.\u201d\nMr. Dahrendorf championed liberal pluralism, which he defined as a social system that recognizes divergent interests and aspirations and puts institutions in place that allow them to be expressed.\nDemocracy is \u201cabout organizing conflict and living with conflict,\u201d he told an audience at the Institute of International Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1989.\n\u201cThe world isn\u2019t simple, nor should it be simple,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s rich because it\u2019s complicated. Let\u2019s learn to live with this.\u201d\nHe explored these ideas in \u201cClass and Class Conflict in Civil Society\u201d (1957), which famously proposed the counter-Marxist idea that power, rather than property, defined social class. Later books like \u201cSociety and Democracy in Germany\u201d and \u201cModern Social Conflict\u201d pursued similar themes.\n\u201cAs a scholar he was always addressing human value problems in democracy, especially freedom, but he was also deeply involved in the civic life of Germany,\u201d said Neil J. Smeltser, an emeritus professor of sociology at Berkeley. \u201cHe bridged the gap between social theory and social practice as well as anyone I can think of.\u201d\nRalf Gustav Dahrendorf was born in Hamburg, where his father, a Social Democratic politician, was arrested and removed from his job by the Nazis in 1933. The family moved to Berlin soon after. Mr. Dahrendorf\u2019s father was arrested again in 1944, and a few months later, Ralf was arrested by the Gestapo for anti-Nazi activities and sent to a concentration camp in Poland. He was released as Soviet forces advanced in 1945.\nAt the University of Hamburg, Mr. Dahrendorf studied philosophy and classics, earning a doctorate in philosophy in 1952. He went on to earn a second doctorate, in sociology, at the London School of Economics, where he studied under Karl Popper. It was Mr. Popper\u2019s \u201cOpen Society\u201d that provided the answers, he once said, to the great questions of modern industrial society posed by Marx.\nAfter teaching at the universities of Saarbr\u00fccken, T\u00fcbingen and Konstanz in West Germany, and at Stanford in California, he ran for a seat in the regional Parliament of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1969 he was elected to the federal Parliament as a Free Democrat. He was a junior foreign minister in Willy Brandt\u2019s first government and in 1970 became a European commissioner.\nAt a time when liberal democracy was under attack, Mr. Dahrendorf, as both a university professor and a politician, held fast to the principles of pluralism and personal freedom. His convictions were Social Democratic with a libertarian spin.\nHe favored laws and policies that encouraged personal freedom, a sense of citizenship and a broadening of social, economic and political opportunities. Germany\u2019s problems, he argued, stemmed from a belief in absolute answers and in the yearning for an all-powerful leader to put them into effect.\nIn 1974 he was invited to become director of the London School of Economics, a post he held for the next decade. He later wrote a history of the school.\nHe returned to Germany to become chairman of the social sciences department at Konstanz University, but in 1987 he accepted the position of warden of St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford. He became a British citizen in 1988 and was made a life peer under the name Lord Dahrendorf of Clare Market in the City of Westminster in 1993.\nIn addition to Dr. Dahrendorf, his third wife, he is survived by three daughters, Nicola, Alexandra and Daphne, and one grandchild.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/world/europe/22dahrendorf.html", "title": "Ralf Dahrendorf, Sociologist, Dies at 80", "author": "WILLIAM GRIMES"}

They were scheduled to arrive later during the weekend.\nThe meeting, which follows one in April that was canceled when Thai anti-government protesters stormed the summit venue, will address preparedness for natural disasters, the response to future economic crises and free-trade agreements, among other issues.\nThe leaders of several non-Asean members \u2014 Australia, China, India, New Zealand and South Korea \u2014 were scheduled to join the meeting later during the weekend.\nIn his opening address on Friday, Thailand\u2019s prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, emphasized the achievements of Asean, which was initially set up more than four decades ago partly as a bulwark against communism. In recent years, Asean has adopted a charter for the grouping, signed free trade agreements with other countries in the region and reduced tariff levels to negligible levels \u2014 although numerous other barriers to trade still exist between member countries.\n\u201cWhat remains is the onus that lies on Asean to prove that it can implement whatever has been agreed, declared, or envisioned,\u201d Mr. Abhisit said, in an apparent response to criticism that the grouping is more talk than substance.\nThe human rights body inaugurated Friday appeared to reinforce that criticism. The job of the commission will be to promote human rights, but it will have no power to investigate governments or impose sanctions.\nA statement distributed by the Thai government here said the commission would \u201cpromote and protect human rights by promoting public awareness and education.\u201d\nMr. Abhisit acknowledged concerns that the commission\u2019s scope was too limited but said it was part of an \u201cevolutionary\u201d process.\n\u201cThe issue of human rights is not about condemnation, but about awareness, empowerment and improvement,\u201d Mr. Abhisit said. \u201cWe shall not only demonstrate to the world that human rights is a priority but also show them realistic and constructive ways to deal with it.\u201d\nYuyun Wahyuningrum, an Indonesian human rights delegate who walked out of the meeting with government representatives Friday, said human rights groups supported the creation of the commission, but were concerned that it was not independent enough. Commissioners were chosen by governments without outside consultation, she said.\n\u201cThe process was very secretive,\u201d she said.\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s human rights record is blemished at best. Myanmar\u2019s military government, which is a member of Asean, is currently detaining more than 2,000 political prisoners including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy leader whose party won a landslide election victory in 1990 that the ruling generals ignored. Cambodia\u2019s parliament passed a law on Wednesday that bars demonstrations of more than 200 people. Malaysia\u2019s government detains people it deems threats to domestic security without trial and maintains tight controls on television stations and newspapers.\nAsean has ambitions to create a single market by 2015 among its 10 member nations, which have a combined population of nearly 600 million people, twice the population of the United States.\nBut its main challenge in recent months has been to tamp down long-running conflicts and disagreements. Relations between Thailand and Cambodia have worsened over a border dispute near an ancient hilltop temple, Preah Vihear. Over the past year, troops in the border area have skirmished several times, leaving seven people dead.\nCambodia\u2019s nationalistic and authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, regularly delivers diatribes against Thailand and has pointedly offered asylum to Thaksin Shinawatra, the ousted Thai prime minister who is sought by the Thai authorities on outstanding arrest warrants.\nSoon after arriving at the meeting Friday afternoon Mr. Hun Sen said Mr. Thaksin would be allowed to stay in Cambodia and serve as his economic adviser.\n\u201cPeople talk about Aung San Suu Kyi from Myanmar. Why can\u2019t we talk about Thaksin?\u201d he asked.\nThe Cambodian government said Friday it would reject any extradition request from Thailand if Mr. Thaksin moved to Cambodia.\nThe host of the meeting, Thailand, deployed more than 30,000 security personnel for the summit to deter supporters of Mr. Thaksin from disrupting the event. Mr. Thaksin was removed from power in a 2006 military coup.\nElsewhere in the region, Indonesia and Malaysia have failed to resolve disputes over territory on Borneo island. Emotionally charged disagreements over the origins of songs, traditional dances and batik cloth-printing techniques have flared in recent months.\nTerritorial disputes also strain relations between the Philippines and Malaysia and Singapore and Malaysia. In the South China Sea, Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam all have claims to areas rich in natural gas deposits.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/world/asia/24asean.html", "title": "Asean Inaugurates Human Rights Commission", "author": "THOMAS FULLER"}

Among the dead were the officer\u2019s wife, his mother and several of her grandchildren, according to a statement from Rafael Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez Lastra, the Tabasco state attorney general. The youngest was a 2-year-old boy.\nA frozen-strawberry vendor, who had driven up to the modest family compound in the hamlet of Monte Largo, was also killed in the attack.\nAnother salesman, who survived the shooting, told the local newspaper Tabasco Hoy that he heard the gunmen move through three small houses where the extended Reyes family lived, shooting high-caliber weapons.\nThree people were wounded in the attack, including Caledonio Reyes L\u00f3pez, a brother of the slain policeman. Local news media reported that he is also a police officer.\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office said prosecutors were investigating whether a feud between the police officer\u2019s family and another family may have been the motive behind the attack. Earlier, officials had told local news media that the killings may have been in retaliation for drug-related arrests that Carlos Reyes L\u00f3pez had made last week.\nMexico faces growing violence as a government crackdown on drug cartels has unleashed a brutal war among rival traffickers over territory. Last year, almost 6,000 people were killed in drug-related violence, according to the federal attorney general\u2019s office.\nOver the past two years, President Felipe Calder\u00f3n has sent tens of thousands of troops around the country to combat the cartels. Despite the government\u2019s success in seizing more drugs and arresting top cartel leaders, the violence has increased and become more brutal.\nThe majority of the dead are members of drug gangs, officials say, but a growing number of police officers and soldiers also are among the dead. The attacks on law enforcement, however, have rarely included their families.\nMuch of the killing has occurred in the states along the United States border. But it has spread increasingly to other states as drug traffickers respond to the crackdown by finding new routes.\nIn Mexico City, the police said Saturday that they had found the decapitated bodies of two women left in the trunk of an abandoned car. Such grisly discoveries have become routine in the border cities of Tijuana and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, but had not been found to have occurred in the capital.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/world/americas/16mexico.html", "title": "Mexico Gunmen Kill Officer and 11 Others", "author": "ELISABETH MALKIN"}
{"date": "Tue, 03 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CHONGQING, China \u2014 Wen Qiang had a fondness for Louis Vuitton belts, fossilized dinosaur eggs and B-list pop stars. For a public employee in charge of the local judiciary, he also had a lot of money: nearly $3 million that investigators found buried beneath a fish pond.\nBut Mr. Wen\u2019s lavish tastes were nothing compared with the carnal appetites of his sister-in-law, Xie Caiping, known as \u201cthe godmother of the Chongqing underworld.\u201d Prosecutors say she ran 30 illegal casinos, including one across the street from the courthouse. She also employed 16 young men who, according to the state-run press, were exceedingly handsome and obliging.\nIn recent weeks, Ms. Xie, Mr. Wen and a cavalcade of ranking officials and lowbrow thugs have been players in a mass public trial that has exposed the unseemly relationships among gangsters, police officers and the sticky-fingered bureaucrats.\nThe spectacle involves more than 9,000 suspects, 50 public officials, a petulant billionaire and criminal organizations that dabbled in drug trafficking, illegal mining, and random acts of savagery, most notably the killing of a man for his unbearably loud karaoke voice.\nBut like all big corruption cases in China, this one is as much about politics as graft. The political machine in Chongqing, a province-size mega-city of 31 million people in the southwest, has been broken up by a new Communist Party boss, Bo Xilai, who is the son of a revolutionary party veteran and has his eye on higher office.\nMr. Bo, a former trade minister sent to Chongqing to burnish his managerial credentials, has conducted the crackdown in a way that appears devised to maximize national attention. The drawn-out nature of the trial and the release of lurid details of the criminal syndicate have given him a reputation as a leading corruption fighter, though the inquiry has yet to implicate any really high-ranking party officials.\nSo far six people have been sentenced to death. Ms. Xie got off relatively lightly, receiving an 18-year prison term on Tuesday.\nHow Mr. Bo\u2019s performance is regarded by the party elite is a matter of speculation. There are some suggestions that his swagger, including boastful comments to the news media, strikes some fellow officials as excessive. Anticorruption campaigns by China\u2019s one-party state are generally calibrated to show resolution in tackling venality, but also to reassure the public that whatever problems are uncovered are localized and effectively contained.\n\u201cThese guys are all for fighting corruption, but they are a little alarmed by the way Bo Xilai has been going about it and building up his personality,\u201d said Sidney Rittenberg, one of the few American citizens to join the Communist Party here and a confidant of Chinese leaders since 1944. \u201cPeople I talk to say he\u2019s getting too big for his britches.\u201d\nA so-called princeling whose father, Bo Yibo, was an economic planner and a onetime ally of the paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, Mr. Bo, 60, is already a member of the Communist Party\u2019s powerful Politburo. He is often talked about as a future top leader in Beijing, although in the party\u2019s rigid hierarchy the No. 1 posts in the party and the government have already been assigned to other younger officials.\nRecent statements by Mr. Bo suggest he understands the perils of drawing too much attention. Two weeks ago, he defended the crackdown, saying he was forced to act by the rampant violence and brazen criminality that had given this perpetually foggy city a reputation for lawlessness.\n\u201cThe public gathered outside government offices and held up pictures of bloodshed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gangsters slashed people with knives just like butchers killing animals.\u201d\nIn the three weeks since trials began, the crowds have continued to come, and their stories of bloodshed are indeed horrifying. They press outside the gates of the Fifth Intermediate Court, hoping to glimpse the orange-vested defendants who are paraded through the hearings.\nOthers desperately seek out reporters willing to hear tales of crimes unpunished. \u201cThe bandits used to live in the mountains; now they live in the Public Security Bureau,\u201d said Zheng Yi, a vegetable wholesaler.\nUnlike past sweeps that brought down crime bosses and their henchmen, the crackdown in Chongqing has yielded a number of wealthy businessmen and Communist Party officials, exposing the depth of corruption that has resulted from the mixing of state control and free-market economics in China.\nKo-lin Chin, who studies the intermingling of organized crime and government in China, said the line between legitimate business and illegal conduct had become increasingly blurred, although most official corruption involved bribery, not violence.\n\u201cAs these gangs have become more powerful, their existence depends entirely on the cooperation and tolerance of the Communist Party,\u201d said Mr. Chin, a professor of criminal justice at Rutgers. \u201cBut when things get out of hand, as they did in Chongqing, the party can really go after these groups with a vengeance.\u201d\nAmong those on trial this week is Li Qiang, a local legislator and billionaire who the authorities say owned a fleet of 1,000 cabs and 100 bus routes. So great was his power, they say, that he orchestrated a taxi strike last year that brought the city to a standstill. On trial with him are three government officials suspected of acting as his \u201cprotection umbrellas\u201d in exchange for payments of about $100,000 each.\nWhile Mr. Li stood in the dock, more than 200 people gathered outside in the rain, including women who said they were roughed up in October last year when they refused to vacate their homes for a redevelopment project. One of them, Wu Pinghui, 67, said 40 people were herded into a government-owned bus and dumped in the countryside. By the time they made it back, their homes were gone.\n\u201cWe called 110,\u201d she said, referring to the Chinese emergency number, \u201cbut the police said they couldn\u2019t get involved in a government affair.\u201d\nHong Guibi also came to the courthouse. She said the Communist Party chief of her village, enraged when she and her husband refused to give him part of their orchard, watched as thugs attacked the couple with cleavers. Ms. Hong, 47, was critically wounded, and her husband was killed. \u201cThe neighbors heard our screams, but they were afraid to do anything,\u201d she said.\nAlthough heartened that so many are being prosecuted, Ms. Hong is still waiting for someone to come after the village chief. \u201cIf I could just kneel down in front of Bo Xilai,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m sure he would solve my problem.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/asia/04crimewave.html", "title": "Chinese Trial Reveals Vast Web of Corruption", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}

It was the second boatload of refugees from Myanmar to land in Aceh in the last month.\nInterviews by the Indonesian Navy indicate that the men are part of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar who fled to Thailand in December.\nSurvivors from the first boat, which was found in early January and was also carrying about 200 men, told Indonesian authorities that they had been rounded up by the Thai military after escaping Myanmar, and then were beaten, towed out to sea and abandoned.\nPrime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva of Thailand denied the claims.\nThe survivors rescued Monday told navy personnel a similar story, adding that originally there was a flotilla of nine motorless boats that had been led out to sea by the Thais, containing about 1,200 people.\n\u201cBased on interviews with some of the survivors, there were originally 220 people on the most recent boat, but 22 people died at sea,\u201d Tedi Sutardi, a naval commander in East Aceh, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe know that nine ships originally left Thailand, so we will monitor the waters around Aceh for the possibility of finding any remaining boats.\u201d\nAbout 850 Rohingya have been rescued in the last month. Three boats were discovered by Indian authorities and another was found near Thailand. The other three boats are still missing.\nThe United Nations calculates that about 723,000 Rohingya live in Myanmar. Rohingya are officially considered foreigners in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar and are not entitled to own land or hold passports.\nIllegal migrants from other parts of Myanmar typically travel across Thailand\u2019s porous borders and either stay in Thailand or travel on to Malaysia, where they work in restaurants, on construction sites or in factories.\nBut the Rohingya have followed different paths: over the past decade many traveled through Bangladesh to Middle Eastern countries to find work. That changed in 2006 when the Bangladeshi government made it harder for the Rohingya to get travel documents, according to Chris Lewa, an expert on the Rohingya who heads a human rights group, the Arakan Project.\nLast week, a spokesman at the Indonesian Foreign Ministry indicated that the first boatload of migrants would be repatriated to Myanmar, saying they were economic migrants, not political refugees. The decision angered human rights organizations as well as Indonesian Muslim groups.\nAlmost 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, and many believe that the government should be reaching out to the Rohingya.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/world/asia/04indo.html", "title": "Myanmar Refugees Rescued at Sea", "author": "PETER GELLING and THOMAS FULLER"}

Christian Bouchacourt, the director of the Latin America branch of the Catholic Society of St. Pius X, said in the statement. He expressed \u201csadness\u201d that the Bishop Williamson\u2019s statements had prompted accusations that \u201cdiscredited\u201d the congregation.\nPope Benedict XVI provoked widespread anger last month when he rescinded the excommunications of Bishop Williamson and three fellow bishops, all members of the Society of St. Pius X, as part of an effort to heal a 20-year schism.\nApparently surprised by the vociferous reaction to the rehabilitation of Bishop Williamson, including unusual public criticism from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the pope\u2019s native country, the Vatican said Bishop Williamson must recant his views on the Holocaust.\nThe pope has also made efforts to soothe offended relations with Jews and other groups angered by Bishop Williamson\u2019s rehabilitation, saying he had been unaware of the bishop\u2019s views.\nNews of Bishop Williamson\u2019s dismissal from the Argentine seminary came after the pope and Chancellor Merkel had a \u201ccordial and constructive\u201d phone conversation, spokesmen for both said Sunday.\nA joint statement issued Sunday by the Vatican and the chancellor\u2019s office said that both the pope and Mrs. Merkel referred to Benedict\u2019s Jan. 28 remarks condemning Holocaust denial and expressing solidarity with Jews.\nA statement released Wednesday by the Vatican Secretariat of State called on Bishop Williamson to recant his comments.

{"date": "Wed, 12 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In March 2003, two C.I.A. officials surprised Kyle D. Foggo, then the chief of the agency\u2019s main European supply base, with an unusual request. They wanted his help building secret prisons to hold some of the world\u2019s most threatening terrorists.\nMr. Foggo, nicknamed Dusty, was known inside the agency as a cigar-waving, bourbon-drinking operator, someone who could get a cargo plane flying anywhere in the world or quickly obtain weapons, food, money \u2014 whatever the C.I.A. needed. His unit in Frankfurt, Germany, was strained by the spy agency\u2019s operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, but Mr. Foggo agreed to the assignment.\n\u201cIt was too sensitive to be handled by headquarters,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI was proud to help my nation.\u201d\nWith that, Mr. Foggo went on to oversee construction of three detention centers, each built to house about a half-dozen detainees, according to former intelligence officials and others briefed on the matter. One jail was a renovated building on a busy street in Bucharest, Romania, the officials disclosed. Another was a steel-beam structure at a remote site in Morocco that was apparently never used. The third, another remodeling project, was outside another former Eastern bloc city. They were designed to appear identical, so prisoners would be disoriented and not know where they were if they were shuttled back and forth. They were kept in isolated cells.\nThe existence of the network of prisons to detain and interrogate senior operatives of Al Qaeda has long been known, but details about them have been a closely guarded secret. In recent interviews, though, several former intelligence officials have provided a fuller account of how they were built, where they were located and life inside them.\nMr. Foggo acknowledged a role, which has never been previously reported. He pleaded guilty last year to a fraud charge involving a contractor that equipped the C.I.A. jails and provided other supplies to the agency, and he is now serving a three-year sentence in a Kentucky prison.\nThe C.I.A. prisons would become one of the Bush administration\u2019s most extraordinary counterterrorism programs, but setting them up was fairly mundane, according to the intelligence officials.\nMr. Foggo relied on C.I.A. finance officers, engineers and contract workers to build the jails. As they neared completion, he turned to a small company linked to Brent R. Wilkes, an old friend and a San Diego military contractor.\nThe business provided toilets, plumbing equipment, stereos, video games, bedding, night vision goggles, earplugs and wrap-around sunglasses. Some products were bought at Target and Wal-Mart, among other vendors, and flown overseas. Nothing exotic was required for the infamous waterboards \u2014 they were built on the spot from locally available materials, the officials said.\nMr. Foggo, 55, would not discuss classified details about the jails. He was not charged with wrongdoing in connection with the secret prisons, but instead accused of steering other C.I.A. business to Mr. Wilkes\u2019 companies in exchange for expensive vacations and other favors. Before leaving the C.I.A. in 2006, he had become its third-highest official, and his plea was an embarrassment for the agency.\nAfter the 2001 terrorist attacks, the intelligence world\u2019s embrace of dark-of-night snatch-and-grabs, hidden prisons and interrogation tactics that critics condemned as torture has stained the C.I.A.\u2019s reputation and led to legal challenges, investigations and internal divisions that may take years to resolve. The Justice Department is now considering opening a criminal investigation, with much of the attention focused on the agency\u2019s network of secret prisons, which have become known as the \u201cblack sites.\u201d\nFrom Fringes to Spotlight\nThe demands of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had transformed Mr. Foggo from a fringe player into the C.I.A.\u2019s indispensable man. Before the 9/11 attacks, the Frankfurt base was a relatively sleepy resupply center, running one or two flights a month to outlying stations. Within days of the attacks, Mr. Foggo had a budget of $7 million, which quickly tripled.\nHe managed dozens of employees, directing nearly daily flights of cargo planes loaded with pallets of supplies, including saddles, bridles and horse feed for the mounted tribal forces that the spy agency recruited. Within weeks, he emptied the C.I.A.\u2019s stockpile of AK-47s and ammunition at a Midwest depot.\nHe was a logical choice for the prison project: aggressive, resourceful, patriotic, ready to dispense a favor; some inside the C.I.A. jokingly compared him to Milo Minderbinder, the fictional character who rose from mess hall officer to the black-market magnate of Joseph Heller\u2019s World War II novel \u201cCatch-22.\u201d\nEarly in the fight against Al Qaeda, agency officials relied heavily on American allies to help detain people suspected of terrorism in makeshift facilities in countries like Thailand. But by the time two C.I.A. officials met with Mr. Foggo in 2003, that arrangement was under threat, according to people briefed on the situation. In Thailand, for example, local officials were said to be growing uneasy about a black site outside Bangkok code-named Cat\u2019s Eye. (The agency would eventually change the code name for the Thai prison, fearing it would appear racially insensitive.) The C.I.A. wanted its own, more permanent detention centers.\nEventually, the agency\u2019s network would encompass at least eight detention centers, including one in the Middle East, one each in Iraq and Afghanistan and a maximum-security long-term site at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, that was dubbed Strawberry Fields, officials said. (It was named after a Beatles song after C.I.A. officials joked that the detainees would be held there, as the lyric put it, \u201cforever.\u201d)\nThe C.I.A. has never officially disclosed the exact number of prisoners it once held, but top officials have put the figure at fewer than 100.\nAt the detention centers Mr. Foggo helped build, several former intelligence officials said, the jails were small, and though they were built to house about a half-dozen detainees they rarely held more than four.\nThe cells were constructed with special features to prevent injury to the prisoners during interrogations: nonslip floors and flexible, plywood-covered walls to soften the impact of being slammed into the wall.\nThe detainees, held in cells far enough apart to prevent communication with one another, were kept in solitary confinement 23 hours a day. For their one hour of daily exercise, they were taken out of their cells by C.I.A. security officers wearing black ski masks to hide their identities and to intimidate the detainees, according to the intelligence officials.\nJust like prisons in the United States, the jailers imposed a reward and punishment system: well-behaved detainees received books, DVDs and other forms of entertainment, which were taken away if they misbehaved, the officials said.\nC.I.A. analysts served 90-day tours at the prison sites to assist the interrogations. But by the time the new prisons were built in mid-2003 or later, the harshest C.I.A. interrogation practices \u2014 including waterboarding \u2014 had been discontinued.\nWinning a Promotion\nMr. Foggo\u2019s success in Frankfurt, including his work on the prisons, won him a promotion back in Washington. In November 2004, he was named the C.I.A.\u2019s executive director, in effect its day-to-day administrative chief.\nThe appointment raised some eyebrows at the agency. \u201cIt was like taking a senior NCO and telling him he now runs the regiment,\u201d said A. B. Krongard, the C.I.A.\u2019s executive director from 2001 to 2004. \u201cIt popped people\u2019s eyes.\u201d\nMr. Foggo soon became embroiled in agency infighting. The C.I.A. was reeling from criticism that it had exaggerated Iraq\u2019s weapons programs. Mr. Foggo came to Washington as part of a new team that almost immediately began firing top C.I.A. officials, causing anger among veteran clandestine officers. Mr. Foggo\u2019s fast rise and blunt approach unsettled some headquarters officials, according to Brant G. Bassett, a former agency officer and friend who served with Mr. Foggo.\n\u201cDusty went in there with a blowtorch,\u201d Mr. Bassett said. \u201cSome people were overjoyed, but there were a few others who said, we\u2019ve got to take this guy down.\u201d\nIn 2005, before he came under investigation, Mr. Foggo and other officials, including John Rizzo, the agency\u2019s top lawyer, paid a rare visit to some of the prison sites, assuring C.I.A. employees that their activities were legal, according to former intelligence officials. Mr. Foggo also met with representatives of Eastern European security services that had helped with the prisons. He expressed gratitude and offered assistance \u2014 a gesture the officials politely declined.\nIn February 2007, Mr. Foggo and Mr. Wilkes were indicted. Prosecutors believed that the C.I.A. had paid an inflated price to Archer Logistics, a business connected to Mr. Wilkes that had a $1.7 million C.I.A. supply contract. In return, the prosecutors claimed, Mr. Wilkes had taken Mr. Foggo on expensive vacations, paid for his meals at expensive restaurants and promised him a lucrative job when he retired.\n\u201cI was taking a trip with my best friend,\u201d Mr. Foggo said in his defense. \u201cIt looked bad, but we had been taking trips together since we were 17 years old.\u201d\nMr. Foggo said he had turned to Mr. Wilkes\u2019 companies to bypass the cumbersome C.I.A. bureaucracy, not to provide a sweetheart deal to his oldest friend. \u201cI needed something done by someone I trusted in private industry,\u201d Mr. Foggo said.\nDownfall in Court\nMr. Wilkes maintains his innocence, but he was eventually convicted in a bribery scandal involving former Representative Randall Cunningham of California. Mr. Foggo pleaded guilty and is serving a sentence on the fraud count, but he still maintains that he was unfairly prosecuted.\nHis lawyer, Mark J. MacDougall, said he believed that Mr. Foggo\u2019s legal problems stemmed in part from controversies over his stint as executive director. \u201cNobody ever accused Dusty Foggo of putting a dime in his pocket, failing to do his job, or compromising national security,\u201d Mr. MacDougall said. \u201cDusty may have made some mistakes, but this case was driven by professional animosity at C.I.A. and personal ambition.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Foggo\u2019s lawyers tried unsuccessfully to obtain access to agency files about his role in the prison program, prosecutors complained that he was trying to disclose a secret program. Mr. Foggo claimed that he was reluctant to divulge his role in classified programs and pleaded guilty, in part, to avoid revealing his secrets.\nIn an Aug. 1, 2007, letter, a C.I.A. lawyer informed Mr. Foggo\u2019s lawyers that they could not review any classified files related to the prisons. The agency\u2019s letter concluded, \u201cIn light of the president\u2019s statements regarding the extraordinary value and sensitivity of the C.I.A. terrorist detention and interrogation program, the C.I.A. denies your request in its entirety.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/world/13foggo.html", "title": "A Window Into C.I.A.\u2019s Embrace of Secret Jails", "author": "DAVID JOHNSTON and MARK MAZZETTI"}

Which is why Tuesday was such a surprise: instead of bombings, it brought the unveiling of stolen treasures, some as old as the Bronze Age.\nThe National Museum was celebrating the return of about 2,000 artifacts that had been smuggled into Britain over the years of war in Afghanistan. British authorities confiscated the smuggled items and, after several years spent figuring out where the artifacts had come from, sent them back to Afghanistan in February.\nThe pieces were on public display for the first time on Tuesday. Visitors peered into glass cases holding delicate blue bowls from the 12th century, a bird-shaped oil burner, and an assortment of tools described as cutter, shaver, bayonet and chopper.\n\u201cThese news stories don\u2019t always make the front pages, but they should,\u201d Mark Sedwill, the British ambassador to Afghanistan, said of the artifacts\u2019 return.\nAfghanistan founded the museum in the 1920s, shortly after the country gained full control over its affairs from Britain. Situated at the crossroads of four great civilizations \u2014 Chinese, Central Asian, Indian and Persian \u2014 Afghanistan is a treasure trove for archaeologists.\n\u201cThis whole area is so rich,\u201d said Nancy Hatch Dupree, director of the Afghanistan Center at Kabul University, who has been involved with Afghan antiquities since the 1960s. \u201cPart of the reason is its geopolitical location.\u201d\nBy the time the Soviet Union invaded in 1979, the museum owned about 100,000 items. But when the pro-Moscow government collapsed in the early 1990s and civil war convulsed the country, artifacts began to disappear.\nThe neighborhood around the museum became too dangerous for government workers to visit. Archaeologists concerned about the museum\u2019s fate negotiated with a rebel leader for the chance to reinforce it against intruders, but the steel doors they had installed proved ineffective. Thieves pulled them out of the mud walls, stole from the storeroom, and put the doors back.\nMost of the artifacts in the Islamic room were burned when a rocket shell punched through the roof. \u201cThey were just little lumps of metal,\u201d Mrs. Dupree recalled of the damaged items.\nThe plunder was devastating. Omara Khan Masoudi, the museum director, estimates that about 70 percent of the museum\u2019s artifacts were stolen from 1992 to 1995, in the brutal years of civil war before the Taliban took over the country. The Taliban were not friends of the country\u2019s archaeological heritage, either; they blew up ancient statues of Buddha in the name of Islam.\nBut some of the most important pieces the museum had were locked away in a secret location by museum administrators in the last years of the Communist government. The museum closed in 1991 and reopened again in 2004 after 13 years of war.\nThe items from Britain are not the first to be returned. About 13,000 artifacts have come back to Afghanistan from Norway, Denmark, Switzerland and the United States since the Taliban fell in 2001, according to Mr. Masoudi.\nSome in the crowd on Tuesday were asking whether it was wise to display valuables.\nMrs. Dupree was sure that it was. \u201cAfghanistan has to give a face to the world that they are more than just the Taliban and NATO,\u201d she said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/world/asia/07afghan.html", "title": "Returned Artifacts Displayed in Kabul", "author": "SABRINA TAVERNISE"}
{"date": "Fri, 16 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 This city\u2019s network of arterials, five ring roads that are fed by nine more freeways, is barely two decades old, but it is already sclerotic. Roughly four million vehicles clog Beijing roads, seven times the number about 15 years ago. On any given day, another 1,500 new vehicles join the crush.\nSo it is no surprise that Beijing has some of the worst air pollution of any big city on earth.\nNo, the surprise is this: Beijing\u2019s air is actually getting cleaner.\nChina may have a hard-earned reputation for long-neglected and fearsome environmental problems, from poisoned rivers to chemical-belching smelters. But the nation\u2019s capital, Beijing, is trying hard to clean up its dirty air.\nThe results show up not only in recent pitch-perfect October days, but in the data that for years have presented a bleak picture of pollution here.\nThrough September, the government counted 221 days in which the 0-to-500 pollution index \u2014 the lower the number, the better \u2014 was below 101. It was the greatest number of \u201cblue-sky days,\u201d as the city calls them, since daily measurements were first published in 1998.\nAt the same time, the city has recorded only 2 days with dangerously high air pollution. That is the lowest number in a decade, and fully 17 days fewer than were logged in the same period in 2000.\nOutside experts caution that the city\u2019s measurements are not just imprecise \u2014 they do not measure the tiniest particulates that are most damaging to lungs, for instance \u2014 but potentially misleading.\nThe government index is a 24-hour average of readings from monitors citywide. In contrast, a single monitor operated by the United States Embassy in downtown Beijing, where traffic is heavy, consistently reports less healthy air conditions than the official index.\nAnd Beijing\u2019s air remains far from pristine by any measure. The average concentration of particulates in city air during 2008, for example, was six times the ideal standard recommended by the World Health Organization. Indeed, Beijing has yet to meet the W.H.O.\u2019s interim air standards for developing countries \u2014 or even the less stringent standards posted by China\u2019s national government.\nYet if the air remains bad, experts say, the trend toward clearer skies is both steady and undeniable.\n\u201cFor those of us who have been monitoring air pollutants for about 10 years, we see a clear reduction in pollution,\u201d Zhu Tong, a professor and air pollution scientist at Peking University\u2019s College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, said in an interview.\nIn the past decade, in fact, authorities have moved against air pollution problems with a tenacity that some environmentalists in developed nations, pitted against industry lobbyists and balky political machinery, can only envy.\nConsider: since 1999, the city has ratcheted up its new-car emissions standards from nonexistent to the level of Euro IV, the same clean-tailpipe requirements that are now enforced across the European Union nations. The rest of China will move to Euro IV next year.\nWith the switch to Euro IV, Beijing environmental officials last year ordered a 90 percent reduction in the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as significant new cuts in polluting compounds like benzene and aromatic hydrocarbons in gasoline.\nNor is that all. More than 4,100 of the 20,000 city buses run on clean-burning compressed or liquefied natural gas \u2014 the largest such fleet in the world. The Beijing subway system, currently about 125 miles of tunnels and overhead tracks, is undergoing a breakneck expansion that will nearly triple its length in the next five years.\nNor is that all, either. Before last year\u2019s Olympics, the government imposed a regimen based on even and odd license-plate numbers that effectively banned half of all private automobiles from the road on weekdays. Officials \u2014 and the public \u2014 liked it so much that a modified version, banning one in five cars, is now a permanent rule.\nThe city also bans heavy trucks from entering the city during the day; after dark, the 18-wheelers can be seen lining up on suburban freeways, waiting for permission to enter. The oldest, dirtiest automobiles \u2014 called \u201cyellow-label\u201d cars, after the sticker glued to their windshields \u2014 are banned from the center city altogether.\nAnd in July, 11 national government ministries took a leaf from the Obama administration\u2019s Cash for Clunkers program and began offering rebates of $440 to $880 to people who trade in old high-pollution cars and trucks for new ones. Officials estimate that the program will sweep about 2.7 million dirty autos from the roads nationwide.\nImpressive as all that is, it may not be enough. While Beijing\u2019s air is cleaner now than in the recent past, the improvements have been largely, though not totally, offset by a sevenfold increase in the number of vehicles since 1993.\nMany of the easy cleanup measures, like improving fuel quality and banning the dirtiest vehicles, have already been made. Future improvements will be harder to attain \u2014 and yet the flood of cars onto the streets is only growing.\nThe government insists that it is winning the race. Because older autos emit as much as 30 times the pollution of new ones, officials say, scrapping a relatively few clunkers makes room for many new replacements. Moreover, improvements in gasoline and diesel fuel quality have lowered pollution from all vehicles, including the older ones.\nBut the city\u2019s cleanup drive is not stopping at its highways.\nIn the past five years, Beijing has converted 60,000 boilers and commercial heaters to run on clean natural gas instead of coal. The city\u2019s four coal-fired power plants \u2014 all of them major polluters \u2014 have installed state-of-the-art pollution scrubbers.\nNearly 2,900 gas stations and petroleum storage tanks have been equipped with recycling controls. Hundreds of heavily polluting factories have been moved from central Beijing, including a coking coal plant and a steel mill that is scheduled to depart by the end of 2010.\nThe mill is a prime example of environmental action, China-style. A unit of the Shougang Group, China\u2019s fourth largest steelmaker, it has been one of Beijing\u2019s biggest employers. When its 140-mile move to neighboring Hebei Province is completed next year, 65,000 Beijing workers will lose their jobs.\nOn the other hand, thousands more are getting a better life. Consider Wang Shuqin, a 64-year-old resident of one of Beijing\u2019s century-old hutongs, or alleys, who recently got a new electric space heater for her two-bedroom apartment.\nLike most all hutong denizens, Mrs. Wang and her husband, Liu Xingye, have weathered decades of Beijing winters by feeding round bricks of coal into a squat pot-bellied stove. Every day they emptied the stove\u2019s ashes, turning their bedroom floor black. Every night they worried about carbon-monoxide poisoning.\nEvery year, they burned 1,200 one-kilogram coal bricks \u2014 one and one-third tons of coal \u2014 to stay warm. Until now: this month, Beijing\u2019s city government gave the couple a two-thirds discount on the electric heater, and a laughably low nighttime rate for electric power, 3 cents a kilowatt-hour.\nSince 2004, Beijing has replaced 94,000 pot-bellied coal stoves with efficient electric heaters, eliminating the filth that came from chimneys burning roughly 100,000 tons of coal a year.\nBecause of that and other changes, Beijing\u2019s sulfur emissions have been cut almost in half compared with 2000, and industrial dust has decreased by two-thirds.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cleaner. It\u2019s much safer,\u201d Mrs. Wang said, flashing a thumbs up. \u201cNow we no longer worry about getting poisoned.\u201d\nIncreasingly, neither does the rest of Beijing.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/world/asia/17beijing.html", "title": "Beijing\u2019s Air Is Cleaner, but Far From Clean", "author": "MICHAEL WINES"}
{"date": "Mon, 14 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 With the turn of a ceremonial valve, China\u2019s president, Hu Jintao, opened a big natural gas pipeline from central Asia to China on Monday, significantly increasing China\u2019s access to the fuel and providing the first major alternative to exporting the region\u2019s gas through Russia.\nThe ambitious project runs 1,140 miles across three Central Asian nations to the Chinese border, linking Turkmenistan to the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Once inside China, it connects with a pipeline that can carry the fuel even farther east.\nThough helpful to energy-parched China, the project siphons potential supplies from the long-delayed pipeline that the European Union would like to see built from Turkey to Central Europe. Such a project could also tap sources of natural gas in Turkmenistan, a stark illustration of the overlapping energy interests at play in the region.\nFor the China pipeline, Turkmenistan says it can supply 40 billion cubic meters of gas for 30 years once the line reaches full capacity, reported China Daily, an official English-language newspaper. That is about the equivalent of half of China\u2019s current consumption of natural gas.\nThe pipeline is the first major export corridor for natural gas out of the region that does not pass through Russia. It breaks from the Soviet-era design of a pipeline system built to supply Eastern Europe via Russia to the north of Central Asia. The new pipe revives a pre-Soviet view of trade in the region, in which economic exchanges flow east and west, not just through Russia.\n\u201cThe startup of this pipeline reconstructs the ancient Silk Roads and symbolizes friendship and cooperation,\u201d Kazakhstan\u2019s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, said at the ceremony on Monday, the Interfax news agency reported.\nMr. Hu was in Turkmenistan to turn the valve, which signaled the start of gas being transported along the pipeline. An inauguration ceremony was also held Saturday in Kazakhstan for that country\u2019s part of the project.\nChina\u2019s accomplishment was all the more notable because Europe and the United States have been jousting with Russia for years to break its natural gas pipeline monopoly.\nAlexander A. Cooley, an authority on Central Asia at Barnard College, said China succeeded because it did not blend energy ventures with support for democratic change in the region, or demands for access to the military bases the United States needs to help wage the war in Afghanistan, as was the case with the Western powers. These other Western policy goals in Central Asia served only to stiffen Russian opposition to European and American oil and gas ventures, which fed into Russia\u2019s fear of being encircled by Western interests in the region, he said.\nRussia also acquiesced to the Chinese because the pipeline poses far less of an immediate threat to the business of Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, than a westbound pipe would, according to Vitaly Y. Yermakov, research director for Russia and the Caspian for IHS CERA, an energy consulting group.\nRussia\u2019s paramount goal is to prevent the West from breaking a monopoly on natural gas pipelines from Asia to Europe, which is the core of Gazprom\u2019s business. The eastbound Chinese pipeline, in contrast, does not undercut an existing Russian export market, because Russia sells no pipeline gas to China now.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/world/asia/15pipeline.html", "title": "New Gas Pipeline From Central Asia Feeds China", "author": "ANDREW E.

He spent four months in prison in 2007 on charges of endangering national security.\nThe sentence came as high-profile negotiations continued over Iran\u2019s nuclear program in Vienna, and some analysts said they believed that the Iranian government might intend to use the harsh jail term as leverage during talks. Similar sentences against political dissidents have been commuted in the past.\nThe charges against Mr. Tajbaksh included being a consultant for the Open Society Institute, which the indictment identifies as a C.I.A. satellite institution devoted to fomenting \u201cvelvet revolutions\u201d in Iran and elsewhere, according to Iran\u2019s official IRNA news agency. The institute was created by the investor and philanthropist George Soros, who finances democracy-building programs in many countries.\nMr. Tajbaksh was also charged with belonging to an e-mail list run by Gary Sick, a professor at Columbia University whom the indictment identifies as a C.I.A. agent. The members of Mr. Sick\u2019s list, known as Gulf/2000, include numerous scholars, diplomats, businesspeople and journalists with a professional interest in the Persian Gulf region.\nMr. Tajbaksh\u2019s court-appointed lawyer, Hushang Azhari, told the news agency that he was appealing the sentence, handed down by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Court. Mr. Azhari said the law forbade him to disclose the exact length of the sentence, which is between 12 and 15 years.\nSeveral analysts said the charges against Mr. Tajbaksh were especially galling because the government had previously approved his work with the Open Society Institute and even invited the organization to work on projects.\n\u201cThe notion that he was somehow behind the electoral unrest is farcical,\u201d said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cShortly after the election he even sent me an e-mail saying he hadn\u2019t seen any proof of fraud.\u201d\nThe sentencing comes during a continuing effort by Iran to quell protests by its dogged opposition, which maintains that the June 12 election was rigged in favor of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nOn Tuesday, over a third of the lawmakers in Iran\u2019s Parliament signed a letter calling for the prosecution of the opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi, IRNA said. Their demand came two days after Mr. Moussavi said once again that the opposition movement would not give in.\nAlthough some prominent detainees have been released in recent days, arrests have continued as well. Last week top aides to Mr. Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, a fiery cleric and presidential candidate, were detained.\nBut antigovernment protests \u2014 albeit much smaller than the vast rallies that followed the election \u2014 have taken place almost daily in universities across Iran since the academic year began late last month. There were more protests on Tuesday at Islamic Azad University in Tehran, just days after security forces sprayed student protesters with tear gas. In the city of Qazvin, students held up banners and chanted antigovernment slogans at Imam Khomeini International University, the Autnews Web site reported.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/world/middleeast/21iran.html", "title": "Scholar Who Was Held After Disputed Iranian Election Is Given at Least 12 Years", "author": "ROBERT F.

The closed market, called Pyongsong, had included an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 stalls where people sold everything from home-grown foods \u2014 cultivated outside collective farms \u2014 to goods smuggled from China.\nSome analysts say the North is cracking down on the markets because it fears the spread of capitalist ideas. But others say its move, against Pyongsong at least, might not be ideological.\n\u201cMany members of the elite are making money off these markets, so I don\u2019t think the government will try to completely shut down the markets,\u201d said Kay Seok, a Seoul-based researcher for Human Rights Watch who has studied the North\u2019s market activities. \u201cInstead, they will try and figure out a way to control the markets as much as possible while making as much profit out of them as possible.\u201d\nNKNet reported that the authorities had shut Pyongsong because vendors in the prosperous market did not donate to \u201curban beautification.\u201d North Korea watchers have said the government is making a push to beautify cities before 2012, when the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-il, is expected to say which of his three sons will succeed him.\nAfter years of allowing unofficial markets to operate, North Korea began placing restrictions on them in 2005, a campaign that defectors say has had limited success as people find ways around the rules.\nIn January, for example, North Korea announced that informal markets should open only once every 10 days, and should sell only clothes and privately produced farm produce, according to the mass-circulation daily Chosun Ilbo of South Korea. Manufactured and imported goods should be sold only in state-run stores, the new directive said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/world/asia/20korea.html", "title": "North Korea Said to Shut Market in Bid for Control", "author": "CHOE SANG-HUN"}

Tauscher, will focus on increasing health security to reduce the impact of outbreaks of infectious disease, whether natural or man-made, administration officials said Tuesday.\nThe United States, these officials said, will pledge to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention, a 1975 treaty barring the development, production and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons.\nBut Ms. Tauscher will declare that the Obama administration does not support efforts to create a mechanism for monitoring compliance with the treaty because, a senior administration official said, supplies of biological weapons are \u201ctoo difficult to verify.\u201d\nIn 2001, the Bush administration abruptly withdrew from lengthy negotiations to create a verification regimen. It cited, in part, the regulatory burdens that verification would place on the American pharmaceutical industry and on the military\u2019s bio-defense research activities.\nRestarting those negotiations would also likely invite demands from Russia and Iran that could undermine the effectiveness of the broader treaty, according to experts on biological weapons.\nBut the major hurdle, they said, is that biological weapons are simply harder to monitor than chemical or nuclear weapons. They can be produced in small labs, using equipment readily converted from peaceful uses, by a rapidly growing and mostly private biotechnology industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost beyond the capacity of traditional arms control, which is why they are proposing these alternative means,\u201d said Jonathan B.

But they concluded with only a cautious statement suggesting a move away from the dollar\u2019s role in global commerce and a call for greater representation of developing countries in global financial institutions.\nBy some predictions, the four nations, Brazil, Russia, India and China, a group referred to as the BRIC group, will surpass the current leading economies by the middle of this century, a tectonic shift that by this reckoning will eventually nudge the United States and Western Europe away from the center of world productivity and power.\nRussia\u2019s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said the main point of the meeting was to show that \u201cthe BRIC should create conditions for a more just world order.\u201d\nThe four countries produce about 15 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product and hold about 40 percent of the gold and hard currency reserves, but they are not a unified bloc and do not do enough business among themselves to justify a trade alliance.\nRussia and Brazil export natural resources, China exports manufactured goods and India bases its growth primarily on domestic demand. As such, India is not as concerned with the status of the dollar and is by no means as intent on scoring ideological points against the United States as is Russia.\nThe acronym BRIC was coined by a Goldman Sachs economist in 2001 to describe the four countries that were expected to surpass today\u2019s largest economies by 2050, owing to their faster growth rate.\nA communiqu\u00e9 issued after the meeting highlighted the common goals of a \u201cgreater voice\u201d in international financial institutions and a \u201cmore diversified\u201d global monetary system. They agreed to meet again in 2010, in Brazil.\nThe gathering was the second of back-to-back summit meetings sponsored by Russia in this city in the Ural Mountains on the divide between Europe and Asia.\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional security alliance intended loosely as a counterweight to NATO, met in an expanded format with many Eurasian nations holding observer status. It even included a brief appearance by the president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election last week has touched off street demonstrations in Tehran.\nIn a sign of regional economic integration, China\u2019s president, Hu Jintao, pledged $10 billion in aid to Central Asian nations in the group, which consists of China, Russia and four former Soviet states: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\nMr. Hu and Mr. Medvedev then met separately with India\u2019s prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\nMr. Medvedev encouraged China, the world\u2019s largest holder of dollar reserves, and other nations to put their money in some other currency or financial mechanism. He also urged members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to use their national currencies in conducting bilateral trade.\n\u201cThere can be no successful currency system, and particularly a global system, if the financial instruments that are used are denominated in only one currency,\u201d Mr. Medvedev said. \u201cToday, this is the case and the currency is the dollar.\u201d\nA top economic policy aide to Mr. Medvedev, Arkady Dvorkovich, said Russia would like to diversify its currency reserves away from dollars by buying bonds from Brazil, China and India, but only if they bought Russian rubles as a reserve.\nThe dollar fell slightly against the euro and other currencies on Tuesday, though some traders quoted by Bloomberg News cited a more workaday cause: good results on new American housing starts were encouraging investors to move out of Treasury bonds and into equities.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/world/europe/17bric.html", "title": "Emerging Economies Meet in Russia", "author": "ANDREW E.

Mr. Kerry said he had repeatedly been assured by intelligence officials that the evidence was inconclusive.\nMr. Kerry and other senior members of Congress were reacting to an article in The New York Times on Wednesday in which current and former American officials said that Mr. Karzai, the younger brother of President Hamid Karzai and a powerful figure in southern Afghanistan, was on the C.I.A. payroll for much of the past eight years.\nThe Obama administration is wrestling with a new Afghanistan strategy amid uncertainty about whether President Karzai\u2019s government can survive questions about its legitimacy.\nAhmed Wali Karzai is believed by many top American military and civilian officials to be enriching himself from the opium trade, although some American intelligence officials said that there was no concrete proof.\n\u201cWe should not condemn Ahmed Wali Karzai or damage our critical relations with his brother, President Karzai, on the basis of newspaper articles or rumors,\u201d Mr. Kerry said Wednesday.\n\u201cBut the appropriate Congressional committees must be immediately provided with the most comprehensive and untainted information about his alleged entanglements,\u201d he said.\nGeorge Little, a C.I.A. spokesman, said agency officials \u201cengage regularly with Congress, providing objective information on a wide range of national security topics.\u201d\nIn Kabul last week, Mr. Kerry helped cajole President Karzai to agree to a runoff election with his top competitor after the Afghan elections in August were marred by widespread voting fraud.\nSenator John McCain of Arizona, a leading Republican voice on national security issues, reacted angrily to the news about Ahmed Wali Karzai, calling the C.I.A. payments \u201cwrong\u201d and suggesting that military commanders in Afghanistan opposed the strategy. \u201cKarzai\u2019s brother should not be in the country,\u201d Mr. McCain said on \u201cThe Early Show\u201d on CBS.\nRobert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, declined to comment on Mr. Karzai\u2019s financial relationship with the C.I.A., referring questions to the spy agency.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/world/asia/29intel.html", "title": "Reported Ties From C.I.A. to a Karzai Spur Rebukes", "author": "MARK MAZZETTI"}

But after they discovered that they did not have the right tools, they left, only to return early the next morning, the police said.\nSurveillance cameras at the site were not working properly, and no security personnel were patrolling that part of the site, officials said.\nThe sign was found in a wood in northern Poland on Monday.\nThe Polish government already provides more than $3.6 million a year for the memorial. But museum officials said they considered that far too little to maintain the museum and grounds.\nJaroslaw Mensfelt, spokesman for the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, said money was a consideration at the vast complex, which during World War II was used to kill more than 1.1. million people, most of whom were Jews.

Without giving further details, he said some of the museum staff, too, would have to pay the consequences.\nFive men, aged 20 to 39, were arrested and charged with theft and for damaging a cultural artifact, according to the Krakow Police Department, which is overseeing the crime.

The announcement came just hours after French investigators said that the airline had not yet replaced a key part for monitoring air speed on the plane as recommended by its manufacturer.\nThe bodies and some personal items \u2014 which appeared to be the first physical evidence of the plane \u2014 were fished from the sea hundreds of miles off Brazil\u2019s northeast coast, according to Brazilian officials. Crews also found a leather briefcase containing an Air France boarding pass with the flight number on it, a blue airplane seat with a serial number and a nylon backpack with a vaccination card inside, the officials said.\n\u201cThe important thing is taking the weight off the shoulders of the relatives,\u201d Jorge Amaral, the assistant head of the Brazilian Air Force Press Office, said at a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s sad news, but it will bring them a certain comfort.\u201d\nThe jet was carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew members.\nInvestigators have been looking into whether inconsistent speed measurements could have played a role in the crash of the Airbus 330. The speed-sensing system includes what is known as a Pitot tube, the part Airbus recommended replacing on some of its planes. The tubes are vulnerable to icing in high-altitude storms, the type of weather the plane may have encountered four hours into the flight to Paris from Rio de Janeiro.\nStill, Paul-Louis Arslanian, director of the French agency investigating the disaster, BEA, said Saturday at a news conference that it was \u201cfar too early to conclude\u201d that a malfunction of the sensors was to blame for the accident, saying that the crew might still have been able to fly the aircraft if it had \u201cdegraded systems.\u201d And an Airbus spokesman said the company issued its advisory two years ago because a better part was available, not because the existing one was \u201ca safety issue.\u201d\nAir-speed sensors can be crucial to the pilots\u2019 ability to control an aircraft. A plane that flies too slowly can lose lift and crash, while one that is moving too fast can break up in the air.\nAirbus said that it had informed air safety regulators in Europe and North America about the recommendation, but on Friday a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration was not able to confirm this, and said that there were no plans to turn the recommendation into a requirement.\nIn a statement posted on its Web site late Saturday, Air France said that the replacement had only been recommended by Airbus, and that regulators would have made it mandatory \u201cshould flight safety be concerned.\u201d\nThe company said it had replaced the tubes on its A320s, a smaller plane earlier, because some of the tubes had malfunctioned on that model. Airbus initially did not think the redesigned tube would solve the problem on the 330, which had fewer tube malfunctions, but after lab tests this year showed an improvement, Air France began a replacement program on the larger planes, the airline said.\nAlthough the tube has not been conclusively implicated in the crash, the airline said it was speeding up the replacements.\nStefan Schaffrath, the Airbus spokesman who confirmed the recommendation to replace the tubes, said the advice was issued because there was a new generation of devices out there with improved performance regarding its measurement capability. \u201cThis is nothing unusual, as there are constant updates ongoing throughout the life of an aircraft,\u201d he said.\nThe discovery on Saturday came after the Brazilian military had recovered floating debris on Thursday and mistakenly concluded that it had belonged to the plane, drawing criticism from French investigators. The military then circled back to try to find other flotsam that surveillance aircraft had sighted earlier in the week.\nThe crew\u2019s discovery on Saturday offered some relatives of the victims at least a small measure of relief.\n\u201cEach relative has a different reaction, but I personally think it is good because you at least know where to start looking and you can begin to understand what is going on,\u201d said Marco Tulio Moreno, whose parents were on the flight and who spoke on Globo News, a television news channel.\nAt least five ships and as many as 14 search planes from France and Brazil have been scouring a 50-mile-long strip of water just north of the equator searching for remains and debris that might help crews locate the black boxes that will be the key to determining what happened to Flight 447.\nThose boxes, which contain data and voice recorders, probably rest at the bottom of the ocean, submerged in 3,000 to 13,000 feet of water in rocky and muddy terrain. The boxes emit signals from a \u201cpinger,\u201d but those will start to fade after 30 days. The French Navy is sending a nuclear-powered submarine to the area in an effort to detect the signals.\nFinding the bodies and the debris Saturday could help the search for the black boxes, since investigators will calculate the winds and currents in the area to try to determine where the plane entered the water. Before crews were searching in the general area of the flight path.\nBut even so, the search will not be easy.\nAt Saturday\u2019s news conference, the French investigator held up a pinger \u2014 a canister about the size of the cardboard inside a toilet paper roll \u2014 and said: \u201cThis is what we are looking for in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/world/europe/07plane.html", "title": "Brazilian Crews Recover Two Bodies From Crash", "author": "ANDREW DOWNIE and NICOLA CLARK"}

Here he is in a festive scene at a park, gamely wearing a red fleece and a Santa Claus hat. Here he is again, playing Frisbee on the beach, clad in a pair of snug bathing trunks that show off his muscular, if pale (he is British) legs.\nOops. It turns out that this is not a regular person at all. He is in fact Sir John Sawers, diplomat and spy, currently the British ambassador to the United Nations and soon to be the chief of MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service. It is as if, suddenly, the Internet were awash with pictures of the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, cavorting half-naked on vacation.\nThe photographs, and a great deal more, came from the collection of Sir John\u2019s wife, Shelley, who has for some time enjoyed chronicling the life and times of her family and friends on a Facebook page. Since its presence was revealed in the tabloid newspaper The Mail on Sunday, the page has been altered so that any revealing photographs it may or may not contain can no longer be seen by the general public.\nBut the disclosure, such as it was, raised a little flurry of excitement in diplomatic and journalistic circles. On one hand, The Mail on Sunday fulminated that the existence of the now-defunct items represented a shocking breach of security that exposed the failings of the state apparatus, possibly compromised the safety of Sir John and Lady Sawers and was \u201cpotentially useful to terrorists.\u201d\nOn the other, \u201cIt is not a state secret that he wears Speedo swimming trunks,\u201d Foreign Secretary David Miliband declared snippily in a television interview. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s a picture that the head of MI6 goes swimming \u2014 wow, that really is exciting.\u201d\nSir John, 53, has previously served as the political director of the Foreign Office, as the ambassador to Egypt and as a foreign affairs adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair. He is due to take over at MI6 in November, replacing Sir John Scarlett. \u201cHe\u2019s an outstanding professional who will do a really good job in an outstanding organization that does a huge amount for this country,\u201d Mr. Miliband told the BBC.\nBecause the items are not available anymore, it is unclear whether the Facebook page indeed contained compromising or secret information. According to The Mail on Sunday, it revealed \u201cthe location of the London flat used by the couple and personal details about their three children and about Sir John\u2019s parents.\u201d By the newspaper\u2019s own account, most of the details were contained in photographs \u2014 19 pictures of the couple on vacation with their friends in the West Country and 22 pictures of Sir John\u2019s mother\u2019s 80th birthday party, among others.\nIt was not so long ago that MI6, the agency that in fiction employs James Bond, was so shrouded in secrecy that the government barely admitted that it existed, let alone condescended to reveal the identity of its chief (forget photographs). That never seemed to stop counterspies from, say, the KGB from knowing a great deal about the secret services, as various episodes over the decades proved.\nBut the days of John Le Carr\u00e9-esque euphemisms and mysteries are over. Sir John\u2019s appointment was announced by Downing Street last month in a statement with only the merest hint of intrigue \u2014 a coy reference, without elaboration, to his \u201crejoining\u201d MI6.\nThe agency now recruits on the Internet and has its own Web site, which describes its mission to \u201ccollect secret foreign intelligence in support of the British Government\u2019s policies and objectives.\u201d\nWhile the Labour government played down the news of the Facebook page, that the page existed at all seemed to divide members of the opposition Conservative Party.\nReferring to the MI6 chief, Patrick Mercer, a Conservative member of Parliament who is chairman of the counterterrorism subcommittee of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: \u201cA great deal of taxpayers\u2019 money has been spent over the past several decades making sure he and his family are protected from security compromises. Well, it doesn\u2019t seem to be very relevant any more, does it?\u201d\nBut Ken Clarke, another Conservative legislator, said: \u201cIn the old days we used to keep the name secret, all photographs were banned \u2014 and I never really believed that the Russians didn\u2019t know who the head of MI6 and MI5 was.\u201d (MI5 is the domestic security agency.)\n\u201cI suspect that the enemies of this country do not wholly rely on The Mail on Sunday and Facebook for their information,\u201d Mr. Clarke told Sky News. \u201cSo I, personally, would get a little more calm.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/world/europe/06britain.html", "title": "On Facebook, a Spy Revealed (Pale Legs, Too)", "author": "SARAH LYALL"}

Laurent Nkunda, the Congolese rebel leader whose brutal tactics and Congo-size ambitions have threatened to bring about another catastrophic war in central Africa, was arrested late Thursday, removing an explosive factor from the regional equation.\nAccording to United Nations officials and Rwandan authorities, General Nkunda was captured by Rwandan troops as he tried to escape a Congolese-Rwandan offensive that has taken aim at several rebel groups terrorizing eastern Congo.\nGeneral Nkunda had seemed untouchable, commanding a hardened rebel force that routinely humiliated Congolese troops and then calmly gliding through muddy villages in impossibly white robes. But he may never have anticipated that his old ally, the Rwandan Army, would take him away.\nThe surprise arrest could be a major turning point for Congo, which has been mired in rebellion and bloodshed for much of the past decade. It instantly strengthens the hand of the Congolese government, militarily and politically, right when the government seemed about to implode. But it could also empower other, even more brutal rebel figures like Jean Bosco Ntaganda, General Nkunda\u2019s former chief of staff, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for war crimes.\nStill, analysts and politicians say they hope that General Nkunda\u2019s capture at the hands of Rwanda means that the proxy war between Rwanda and Congo is finally drawing to a close.\nA United Nations report in December accused high-ranking Rwandan officials of sending money and troops to General Nkunda, a fellow Tutsi who claimed to be protecting Congolese Tutsi from marauding Hutu militias. This cross-border enmity has been widely blamed for much of the turmoil, destruction, killing and raping that has vexed Congo for years.\nJohn Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough Project, which campaigns against genocide, called it a \u201cmassive turn of events.\u201d\n\u201cFinally the two countries are cooperating,\u201d he said.\nKikaya bin Karubi, a member of Congo\u2019s Parliament, said General Nkunda\u2019s arrest \u201ccould be the beginning of the end of all the misery.\u201d\n\u201cLook what happened at Kiwanja,\u201d he said, referring to a small Congolese town where United Nations officials said General Nkunda\u2019s forces went door to door, summarily executing dozens of civilians in November.\nNow, if Congo gets its way, General Nkunda will have to face the consequences. The government is urging Rwanda to extradite General Nkunda so he can stand trial in Kinshasa, Congo\u2019s capital, where he could face a war crimes tribunal and treason charges, punishable by death.\nBut Rwandan authorities were tight-lipped on Friday about what they would do with General Nkunda. \u201cI can\u2019t speculate,\u201d said Maj. Jill Rutaremara, a spokesman for Rwanda\u2019s Defense Forces. All he would say was that General Nkunda was \u201cin the hands of Rwandan authorities.\u201d\nThough General Nkunda never controlled more than a handful of small towns in eastern Congo, he was Congo\u2019s No. 1 troublemaker. His troops have been accused of committing massacres dating back to 2002. General Nkunda recently began cultivating national ambitions to overthrow Congo\u2019s weak but democratically elected government, which threatened to draw in Congo\u2019s neighbors and plunge central Africa into a regional war, something that has happened twice before.\nGeneral Nkunda\u2019s confidence may have been his undoing. On Thursday night, hundreds of Rwandan troops cornered him near Bunagana. Congolese officials said he refused to be arrested and crossed into Rwanda, where he was surrounded and taken into custody. It is not clear how many men he had with him at the time, but it appears he was taken without a shot.\nJust a few days ago, Rwanda sent several thousand soldiers into Congo as part of a joint operation to flush out Hutu militants who had killed countless people in the 1994 Rwanda genocide and were still haunting the hills on Congo\u2019s side of the border.\nFew expected the Rwandan troops to go after General Nkunda. Not only is he a Tutsi, like Rwanda\u2019s leaders, but he had risen to power by fighting these same Hutu militants. Several demobilized Rwandan soldiers recently revealed a secret operation to slip Rwandan soldiers into Congo to fight alongside General Nkunda. He had been trained by the Rwandan Army in the mid-1990s and was widely believed to be an agent for Rwanda\u2019s extensive business and security interests in eastern Congo.\nBut it seems that the Rwandan government abruptly changed its tack, possibly because of the international criticism it has endured for its ties to General Nkunda. Several European countries recently cut aid to Rwanda, sending a strong signal to a poor country that needs outside help. Rwanda may have figured the time was ripe to remove General Nkunda, analysts said.\nEarlier this month, some of General Nkunda\u2019s top commanders split from him, saying they were fed up with his king-of-the-world brand of leadership. One of those commanders was Mr. Ntaganda. Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court have accused him of building an army of child soldiers, a war crime.\nBut Mr. Ntaganda suddenly switched sides, denouncing General Nkunda and saying that he and his men were now eager to join the Congolese Army, which they had been battling for years. Many analysts believe that the Congolese government promised to try to protect Mr. Ntaganda from being sent to The Hague.\nAccording to Jason Stearns, an analyst who recently served on a United Nations panel examining the conflict: \u201cIt\u2019s fairly clear that Kigali and Kinshasa have struck a deal. Kinshasa will allow Rwanda onto Congolese soil to hunt down\u201d the Hutu militants, \u201cand in return Rwanda will dethrone Nkunda.\u201d\nCongolese officials are now talking about restoring full diplomatic relations with Rwanda, which had been suspended for years, and reinvigorating economic ties. But many uncertainties remain, including a possible power scramble by other militant groups hoping to fill the vacuum.\n\u201cNkunda\u2019s arrest is part of a larger, radical realignment,\u201d Mr. Stearns said. \u201cThere are, however, many unknowns and risks.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/world/africa/24congo.html", "title": "A Congolese Rebel Leader Who Once Seemed Untouchable Is Caught", "author": "JEFFREY GETTLEMAN"}

{"date": "Fri, 09 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "QUITO, Ecuador \u2014 The multibillion-dollar legal case between Amazon peasants and Chevron over oil pollution in Ecuador\u2019s rain forest keeps unfolding more like a mystery thriller than a battle of briefs.\nEver since the oil giant released videos in August that were secretly taped by two businessmen who seemed to have the ambition of feasting off the expected $27 billion in damages sought, Ecuadorean officials and Chevron have accused each other of gross improprieties, including espionage.\nThe Ecuadorean judge hearing the case recused himself after he appeared in the recordings discussing the case and potential damages. He was returned to the case by another judge, but he was then removed again.\nThe two mysterious businessmen, who used watches and pens implanted with bugging devices to make the recordings, have refused to explain their motivations for going to the furtive meetings in Quito and a jungle outpost to discuss a bribery plot. And now, with questions mounting, one of them has enlisted a lawyer who has represented Barry Bonds.\nIn recent days the plot has thickened further. The Ecuadorean political go-between whose taped remarks about apportioning bribes put him in the middle of the scandal, Patricio Garc\u00eda, said he was entrapped in a dirty-tricks campaign by Chevron.\nIn an interview, he claimed that Chevron had masterminded an industrial espionage project, with digitally manipulated videos and gangsters disguised as entrepreneurs on the prowl for contracts, intended to smear him and Ecuador\u2019s legal system.\n\u201cThis was all planned from the United States, by Chevron itself,\u201d said Mr. Garc\u00eda, 55, a businessman and former car mechanic. He chafed at any suggestion, as laid out in recordings made public by Chevron, that he had discussed a bribery scheme that was to include President Rafael Correa\u2019s sister, Pierina Correa, and Judge Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who was then overseeing the case.\nIt is not clear from the recordings and transcripts provided by Chevron whether any bribes were paid or whether Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Ms. Correa were aware of plans to try to bribe them. Ms. Correa has denied knowing Mr. Garc\u00eda, or having anything to do with the plot, and Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez has also denied any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, governing party and government officials have characterized Mr. Garc\u00eda as a man of little influence.\nEcuador\u2019s attorney general still somewhat echoes Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s interpretation of the events caught on the tapes, saying that Chevron\u2019s contacts with the businessmen who discussed bribes mean the company should be investigated in the United States for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which outlaws bribery of foreign officials to obtain business.\n\u201cIt seems to me that Chevron\u2019s strategy is to delegitimize the actions of our judges,\u201d said Washington Pes\u00e1ntez, the attorney general. He added that he regretted that a resolution of the lawsuit, which has dragged on for 16 years, had been delayed by a month with the disclosure of the videos. \u201cJustice that is delayed is not justice,\u201d Mr. Pes\u00e1ntez said.\nThe tapes were the latest turn in a legal marathon over oil contamination left by Texaco years before it was acquired by Chevron. On one tape, Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez seems to suggest that he plans to rule against Chevron and that damages could exceed $27 billion, making it potentially the biggest environmental suit in history.\nWhether Chevron avoided such an outcome by releasing the tapes may not become clear for months, or even years. Chevron gambled that the disclosure of the videos would enable it to cast doubt on the integrity of the trial and the honesty of the Ecuadorean legal system. But the tapes have also raised questions about its ties to the men who made the recordings, potentially opening the company to a new legal fight.\nTaping conversations without everyone\u2019s permission is illegal in Ecuador, and trying to bribe foreign officials is illegal under American law. But shades of gray tinge nearly everything to do with the videos. For instance, Mr. Garc\u00eda, the political go-between, said the businessmen who tied him to the bribery plot joked about recording their meetings with a wristwatch, potentially giving them a way out if scrutiny of their tactics intensifies.\n\u201cFor someone who is trying to figure out what you can learn from this, it\u2019s not as though it yields a rational narrative,\u201d said Ralph G. Steinhardt, professor of law and international affairs at George Washington University Law School, who has been following the case. \u201cIn trying to appreciate the complexities of this case, you need to have the skills of a poker player rather than the skills of a lawyer.\u201d\nChevron says that it neither coached nor paid the businessmen to make the tapes, and that it did not edit the material, though it did give one of the men, Diego Borja, an undisclosed amount for moving and living expenses so he could safely move his family out of Ecuador.\nCompany spokesmen say that when Mr. Borja, an Ecuadorean logistics contractor working with an American businessman, brought tapes of three meetings to Chevron, company officials urged him not to go to more meetings because doing so could be dangerous.\n\u201cChevron had no involvement in the videotaping,\u201d said Kent Robertson, a company spokesman. \u201cChevron referred this matter to the U.S. Department of Justice and Ecuador\u2019s prosecutor general after making every reasonable effort to verify the evidence that was presented.\u201d\nMr. Borja went back for a fourth meeting, taped it, and gave more evidence to the company. But no one has yet explained what motivated him and his partner, Wayne Hansen, an American, to travel around Ecuador meeting officials and collecting evidence of a bribery scheme, especially one in which they stood to gain lucrative contracts.\nNeither the men nor their lawyers would talk, although Mr. Borja\u2019s lawyer, Cristina C. Arguedas, who has represented Mr. Bonds and other elite athletes in connection with the investigation into performance-enhancing drugs, released a statement: \u201cDiego is an outstanding and proud Ecuadorean who came forward on his own to expose corruption. He will answer all questions in a fair proceeding.\u201d\nThe video and transcripts have been open to interpretation. Still a mystery, for instance, is why supposedly well-connected Ecuadoreans with knowledge of the case would discuss bribes in exchange for government cleanup contracts to come out of a settlement in the Chevron case.\nChevron hopes to delay any future payments for many years; since it has no major assets in Ecuador, it would not be easy to get it to pay, even if it lost. Had the Ecuadorean officials checked Mr. Borja\u2019s background, they would have seen that he had been a contractor for Chevron for years.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/world/americas/10chevron.html", "title": "Ecuador Oil Pollution Case Only Grows Murkier", "author": "SIMON ROMERO and CLIFFORD KRAUSS"}
{"date": "Tue, 10 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 More than a decade after United Nations peacekeepers failed to prevent massacres in Rwanda and Srebrenica, Bosnia, what many consider the organization\u2019s flagship mission appears to be slouching toward crisis once again, diplomats and other experts say.\nThe most immediate cause, they say, is a sharp rise in the number of peacekeeping commitments worldwide and a type of \u201cmission creep\u201d that has added myriad nation-building duties to the traditional task of trying to keep enemies apart. The new demands come at a time when member states with advanced armies in particular have become more resistant to committing additional troops or even necessary equipment like helicopters.\nThose challenges have only added to a deeper and longstanding problem: the continued lack of clarity about how the United Nations should intervene when its members lack either the military force or the political will \u2014 or both \u2014 to halt carnage.\n\u201cPeacekeeping has been pushed to the wall,\u201d said Bruce Jones, the director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University, which is working with the United Nations on reform efforts. \u201cThere is a sense across the system that this is a mess \u2014 overburdened, underfunded, overstretched.\u201d\nAmong the most noticeable failures in recent months: the inability of troops in Congo and the Darfur region of Sudan to stop the violence that is killing civilians, the difficulty in finding enough troops for either of those missions, and the unwillingness of any nation to lead a possible mission in Somalia.\nIn Congo in December, a contingent of 100 peacekeepers that was less than a mile away did not intervene in a rebel massacre that human rights investigators said killed 150 people; the peacekeepers reported that they were short of equipment and manpower and lacked the intelligence capacity to figure out what was happening in the nearby town.\nIn some conflict zones, peacekeepers do not have the technology to fulfill even one of their most basic tasks: tracking the movements of the armed groups they are trying to keep separate.\nThe problems prompted several leaders of the United Nations\u2019 peacekeeping efforts to embark on a new round of studies about how to ensure peacekeepers can fulfill their missions, the efforts being extended over several months to try to avoid suggestions for quick fixes that get shelved.\nBut some experts say the most important fix is perhaps the hardest. The Security Council, they say, needs to avoid sending missions to countries where there is not yet a real peace to keep.\nThe difference between peacekeeping mandates, one written in 1974 and the other taking effect less than 14 months ago, goes a long way toward explaining the difficulties United Nations troops now face.\nThe mandate that established the United Nations force on the Syria-Israel border nearly 35 years ago is just a few sentences long \u2014 basically directing the troops to monitor the cease-fire. Ever since, the bloodiest scenes witnessed by the blue-helmeted soldiers deployed with little more than binoculars have mostly been of stray cows blown up by land mines.\nThe 2007 mandate establishing the United Nations peacekeeping force for Darfur covers more than two pages and details a battery of tasks, which include protecting civilians, guiding an inclusive political process, promoting economic development and human rights, and monitoring the border with neighboring states.\n\u201cPreviously, you were there as an important symbol rather than as an active force,\u201d said Nicholas Haysom, the United Nations director for political, peacekeeping and humanitarian affairs.\nThe scope and number of missions expanded, in good part, to try to address past failures.\nAfter sending five successive missions to Haiti, where the violence erupted again after they left, for example, the United Nations decided that peacekeepers should do more to ensure that countries were economically stable when they departed.\nAnd after the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia, the United Nations added the protection of civilians as a priority for each mission.\nBut many feel that peacekeeping has become a panacea, with the deployment of United Nations forces considered proof that the Security Council is paying attention to a crisis, whether the troops are effective or not. The Council has a tendency to just keep extending missions once approved.\nAs a result, the number of personnel on peacekeeping missions has grown to 113,000 soldiers, police officers and civilians assigned to 18 missions, from 40,000 in 2000.\nIn the past few months alone, the Security Council has voted to take over a European mission deployed in Chad, to beef up the force in eastern Congo and to contemplate deploying a new force in Somalia.\nThe peacekeeping budget has ballooned to $8 billion.\nThe United States pays about 27 percent of that budget, and Ambassador Susan E. Rice has suggested that the Obama administration will seek changes in peacekeeping missions, but she has yet to define them.\nAt least three different efforts have started recently within the United Nations system to find ways to streamline and improve peacekeeping, including one by the Council itself.\nExperts inside and outside the United Nations say two changes are essential.\nThe forces need to train specifically for every aspect of their expanded mandates \u2014 how to intervene to stop a rape epidemic in the Congo, for example.\nBut the most critical change, the experts say, would be for the United Nations to resist sending forces into active battle zones, including those where they could find themselves pitted against a national government.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t start a war against a host government like a well-organized Sudanese campaign,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Patrick C. Cammaert, a Dutch marine with long experience in United Nations peacekeeping operations. \u201cThat goes beyond protecting civilians; it is on a magnitude that a U.N. mission cannot deal with. It is a political issue that the Security Council has to decide before issuing the mandate.\u201d\nAnd Maj. Gen. B. T. Obasa, the military attach\u00e9 at the United Nations Mission of Nigeria, which deploys some 4,000 soldiers in Darfur, expressed frustration that the countries contributing troops are not consulted more.\n\u201cWe were supposed to go to Sudan to keep the peace, not for peace enforcement, which we find ourselves doing now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the U.N. goes into any country, they should know and be certain what we are going to do there, what the requirements are and how long we will stay.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/world/11peacekeeping.html", "title": "In Peacekeeping, a Muddling of the Mission", "author": "NEIL MacFARQUHAR"}
{"date": "Fri, 06 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Iraqi leaders in Kirkuk Province have charged that twice in the last two weeks the American military violated the hard-won security agreement signed in November by attacking Iraqi criminal suspects without coordinating with Iraqi security forces.\nThe first episode occurred last month, when American soldiers fatally shot an Iraqi couple in their home near Kirkuk after the wife reached for a pistol hidden under a mattress, American and Iraqi officials said. The couple\u2019s 8-year-old daughter was wounded. The shooting was reported at the time, but the charges of failure to coordinate emerged on Friday, hours after an American raid in which a 58-year-old man was shot and killed outside of Kirkuk.\nThe two episodes highlight the difficulties the Americans and Iraqis are encountering as they try to comply with the security agreement\u2019s requirement that American troops have \u201cfull coordination with Iraqi authorities,\u201d particularly in places where there are still active counterinsurgency operations.\nIn some places, Iraqi and American special forces are conducting many of the raids, but it appears that they do not necessarily contact units stationed in the field. Interviews with witnesses to the Friday raid, including the 58-year-old man\u2019s son, suggested it did not involve the military units that regularly patrol in the area.\nThe son, Nihad Muhammad Hassan al-Bachary, 16, described a sudden, brutal invasion of the family home. \u201cThe American forces stormed into our house, and they handcuffed me, my two brothers and my uncle,\u201d the son said. \u201cWhen my father came out of his room, they opened fire on him point blank and then they stuffed his body in a large, black plastic bag.\u201d\nThe soldiers who came in were directed by an American in a military uniform, the son said, but unlike most soldiers, he had a beard. The other armed men with him were wearing masks and Iraqi commando uniforms and speaking in \u201cKurdish and inaccurate Arabic,\u201d the son said. He said that his father was an Agriculture Ministry employee, and that several other family members were detained elsewhere in the village at the same time.\nThe police chief of the nearby city of Hawija said that he had not been warned of the raid, and that when his officers tried to enter the village, they were stopped by American soldiers. \u201cAn American force told us that, \u2018There is a special force in there,\u2019 \u201d said the police chief, Ibrahim al-Juboori.\n\u201cThe police department for Hawija District had no knowledge of the operation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who were arrested and the one that was killed were not known as terrorists.\u201d\nHawija was a onetime stronghold for Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a homegrown insurgent group that American intelligence believes has foreign leadership. Hussein Ali Saleh al-Juboori, a powerful local politician and the founder of the Hawija Awakening Council, which chased Al Qaeda from the area, warned that such episodes ran the risk of inspiring insurgents. \u201cHawija will become a center for resistance, not terrorism as it was before,\u201d the politician said. \u201cI have spoken with the Americans in Bachary and Kirkuk and the Joint Coordination Center, and they have no knowledge of what happened.\n\u201cThere have been repeated breaches after the signing of the strategic agreement,\u201d he said, citing the January case \u201cwhen a man and his wife were killed and his daughter was injured. We demand immediate investigation.\u201d\nIraqi Army commanders underscored the coordination problem. Speaking on condition of anonymity, they said that the men who were detained and the man who was killed were suspected of manufacturing explosives, and that they had resisted arrest. But they said such considerations did not exempt Americans from the requirement to coordinate.\nCol. Jassim Saadon, head of the Hawija force in the Iraqi Army, said that he, too, knew nothing of the raid until afterward. \u201cThere is a lack of coordination between the forces that execute the orders and the local forces,\u201d he said.\nAngriest was a high-ranking Iraqi commander. He said that the Americans had apologized, but said, \u201cUpsetting and violating the families will not help the process at all. And though the Americans came down here to apologize for the incident, we said that we did not want an apology but precoordination.\u201d He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press on this subject.\nIn the future, he said, military forces undertaking raids outside the city of Kirkuk without coordinating with his division would be treated as \u201chostile forces.\u201d The only exceptions, he said, were \u201csituations where a terrorist is arrested wearing an explosive belt or planting a bomb.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/world/middleeast/07iraq.html", "title": "U.S. Military Violated Security Agreement Twice in 2 Weeks, Iraqi Leaders Say", "author": "ALISSA J.

James L. Jones.\nMr. Garcia said that \u201cvery important countries \u2014 the majority in terms of population and political weight \u2014 won\u2019t recognize\u201d the results of the election.\nNeither Mr. Micheletti nor Mr. Zelaya, who has been living in the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, the capital, since sneaking back into Honduras in September, is running for president.\nMuch of Latin America had hoped that President Obama would herald a new era in Latin American diplomacy, after eight years of the unpopular Bush administration and decades of perceived meddling by Washington.\n\u201cIt would be good if that expectation were not frustrated,\u201d Mr. Garcia said he had told General Jones.\nMr. Garcia and other Latin American diplomats contend that recognizing the election will essentially legitimize a coup in a region that has been consolidating its democracies.\nHe and others say that conditions for free elections do not now exist in Honduras.\n\u201cThe election has the fingerprints of a coup,\u201d Mr. Garcia said.

{"date": "Tue, 10 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 The Dalai Lama delivered one of his harshest attacks on the Chinese government in recent times on Tuesday, saying that the Chinese Communist Party had transformed Tibet into a \u201chell on earth\u201d and that the Chinese authorities regarded Tibetans as \u201ccriminals deserving to be put to death.\u201d\n\u201cToday, the religion, culture, language and identity, which successive generations of Tibetans have considered more precious than their lives, are nearing extinction,\u201d said the Dalai Lama, 73, the spiritual leader of Tibetans.\nHe spoke in Dharamsala, India, the Himalayan town that is the seat of the Tibetan government in exile. Tibetans outside of China and their supporters held rallies around the world on Tuesday to mark the 50th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule. China crushed the rebellion, forcing the Dalai Lama to flee to India.\nThe furious tone of the speech may have been in reaction to a new clampdown by China on the Tibetan regions. The Dalai Lama may also have adopted an angry approach to placate younger Tibetans who have accused him of being too conciliatory toward China. He advocates genuine autonomy for Tibet and not secession, while more radical Tibetans are urging him to support outright independence.\nIn the rugged Tibetan regions of China, where there is widespread resentment at Chinese rule, no reports emerged Tuesday of any large-scale protests. The Chinese government, fearing civil unrest among six million Tibetans, has locked down the vast areas, which make up a quarter of Chinese territory, by sending in thousands of troops in the past few weeks and cutting off cellphone and Internet services in some locations. An unofficial state of martial law now exists, with soldiers and police officers operating checkpoints, marching through streets and checking people for identification cards.\nPresident Hu Jintao called this week for the building of a \u201cGreat Wall\u201d of stability in Tibet.\n\u201cWe must reinforce the solid Great Wall for combating separatism and safeguarding national unity, so that Tibet, now basically stable, will enjoy lasting peace and stability,\u201d Mr. Hu said while meeting with Tibetan officials in Beijing on Monday, according to Xinhua, the state news agency.\nAcross Tibet, monks at large monasteries have been ordered to stay indoors.\nIn the town of Tongren, in Qinghai Province, monks at the Rongwo Monastery, where protests erupted last year, were told that they could not leave the compound from March 6 to March 16, said two monks reached by telephone. Security forces in riot gear have encircled the monastery. No classes or prayer gatherings were held Tuesday, and one monk said he and his peers were reading scriptures in their rooms.\n\u201cThis morning, I cried,\u201d he said.\nThe monk declined to give his name for fear of government retribution. A year ago this month, he was studying in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, and taking part in protests to mark the 49th anniversary of the failed uprising. When security forces suppressed those protests, Tibetans began rioting in the streets, attacking ethnic Han Chinese civilians and burning shops and vehicles.\nThe uprising quickly spread to Tibetan areas in other provinces, becoming the largest rebellion against Chinese rule in decades. At least 19 people were killed in Lhasa, most of them Han Chinese civilians, according to the Chinese government. In the violent repression that followed, 220 Tibetans were killed, nearly 1,300 were injured and nearly 7,000 were detained or imprisoned, according to the Tibetan government in exile. More than 1,000 Tibetans are still missing.\nIn a report released Tuesday, Human Rights Watch said that official Chinese accounts of last year\u2019s uprising and its aftermath showed that \u201cthere have been thousands of arbitrary arrests, and more than 100 trials pushed through the judicial system.\u201d\nOfficials from Lhasa said last week that 953 people were detained after the riots and that 76 of them were sentenced on charges of robbery, arson and attacking government institutions. The others have all been released, the officials said.\nThe Chinese government has accused the Dalai Lama of fomenting separatist violence; he says he is pushing only for autonomous powers that are outlined in the Chinese Constitution.\nIn his speech, the Dalai Lama reiterated that such autonomy had been promised to Tibet by Mao and other senior Chinese leaders whom he met in Beijing in 1954 and 1955. The Dalai Lama began negotiations over the future of Tibet after Chinese troops invaded the Tibetan plateau and seized full control of Tibet in 1951.\nDespite the promises from Mao, he said, the Chinese government carried out \u201ca series of repressive and violent campaigns\u201d through the decades, including what the Chinese called \u201cpatriotic re-education\u201d and \u201cstrike hard\u201d campaigns after the protests last year.\n\u201cThese thrust Tibetans into such depths of suffering and hardship that they literally experienced hell on earth,\u201d the Dalai Lama said.\nChina has defended its policies in Tibet by saying that it abolished a feudal slave-holding system overseen by the Dalai Lama and poured vast sums of money into building roads, railroads and other infrastructure projects.\nDespite his harsh words, the Dalai Lama reaffirmed his commitment to trying to maintain a dialogue with China.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/asia/11tibet.html", "title": "Dalai Lama Says China Has Turned Tibet Into a \u2018Hell on Earth\u2019", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}
{"date": "Mon, 26 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Four American soldiers were killed in a crash involving two helicopters in northern Iraq, the United States military said Monday. It was the largest loss of life for American forces here in four months.\nThe military command in Baghdad said in a brief statement that the cause was unclear but that it did not appear to be \u201cenemy action.\u201d The statement did not say whether the helicopters had collided with each other.\nAn Iraqi security source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was forbidden to speak to the news media, said the helicopters had crashed in an open field in an area known as Chalak, about 10 miles south of Kirkuk. An oil city, Kirkuk is 180 miles north of Baghdad.\nThe security source and Mohammed Jarallah, a guard at an irrigation project in the area, said the crash happened Sunday before midnight. They reported hearing loud explosions and seeing large flames rising from the site of the crash.\nThe same sources said that after the American military retrieved the wreckage, the Sunni Arab insurgent group known as the Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order, sometimes referred to as the Naqshbandi Army, distributed leaflets in the area claiming it had downed the two helicopters with makeshift rockets.\nThe group is known to operate in the Kirkuk area and other parts of the north, but its claim could not be independently verified.\n\u201cTo the children of our resisting Iraqi nation,\u201d the leaflet said, \u201cwe bring you the joyous news of downing two helicopters belonging to the American enemy with the Sadeed rockets.\u201d The group promised to post a video of the attack later on the Internet.\nThe group, named after a Muslim Sufi order, is linked to Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who was one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s top aides, and members of his family, according to American military intelligence officers. Mr. Douri, who is ailing but whose whereabouts remain a mystery, is an ardent follower and patron of the Naqshbandi order in Iraq.\nThe latest deaths raised to at least 4,236 the number of American service members reported to have died in the Iraq war since it began in March 2003.\nThe helicopter crash in Chalak had the largest single toll of American troops since Sept. 18, when seven American soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash in the southern desert west of Basra. While combat deaths for American forces in Iraq have fallen sharply in the past few years, there has been a string of aviation deaths. In November, a helicopter made a hard landing after hitting wires in the northern city of Mosul, killing two American soldiers.\nThe American military relies heavily on helicopters and other aircraft to ferry troops, dignitaries and supplies to avoid the threat of ambushes and roadside bombs in Iraq. At least 70 American helicopters have gone down since the war started, according to military figures. Of those, 36 were confirmed to have been shot down.\nSeparately on Monday, police officials said that 18 Iraqis were wounded in bomb attacks aimed at members of Iraq\u2019s security forces in Baghdad, Baquba and Mosul.\nMeanwhile, the recent plunge in oil prices continued to affect Iraq\u2019s 2009 budget, in which about 86 percent of revenues are derived from oil exports. The government met Sunday to revise this year\u2019s budget for a second time, to 72.9 trillion Iraqi dinars ($62 billion), said a statement issued Monday by a government spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh.\nThe 2009 budget was slashed in November to $67 billion from $80 billion. The latest budget draft, which is expected to be discussed in Parliament next month, puts capital investment at $12 billion, down about 18 percent from November\u2019s draft.\nThe squeeze in Iraq\u2019s finances comes as the government seeks to solidify fragile security gains by improving basic services, spurring job creation and rehabilitating the country\u2019s battered infrastructure. In the past week, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has been on a whirlwind campaign tour of impoverished southern Iraq, drumming up support for his slate of candidates in provincial elections this Saturday.\nHe promised rapt audiences everywhere to provide jobs and housing.\n\u201cWe have set our sight on rebuilding Iraq, providing an honorable life for its citizens, supporting agriculture, resuscitating our factories and plants, and building our armed forces,\u201d Mr. Maliki told crowds during a rally on Monday in Babil Province.\nBut given the country\u2019s immense investment needs, fulfilling some of these promises, at least in the short term, hinges on stable oil prices and higher production.\nOil prices have come down by nearly two-thirds in the past six months, from a peak of $147 a barrel. The latest budget draft assumes an oil price of $50 a barrel and an export rate of two million barrels a day, according to Mr. Dabbagh.\nProjected revenues are $43 billion, resulting in a deficit of $19 billion, which would be plugged with last year\u2019s surplus.\nIraq sits on the world\u2019s third largest oil reserves, but the government has been unable since 2003 to achieve any significant increase in production, which now hovers around 2.4 million barrels a day. Only 15 of Iraq\u2019s 78 oil and gas fields are operational. The government has in the past blamed sabotage by insurgents, and the large investment sums needed for infrastructure rehabilitation, for the flat production.\nIn an effort to triple production within five years, Iraq invited 35 international oil companies to bid last year on two rounds of licenses for the development of 19 oil and gas fields. The first round is expected to be concluded in June.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/world/middleeast/27iraq.html", "title": "Crash in Iraq Kills 4 U.S. Soldiers", "author": "SAM DAGHER"}

The declaration on Thursday represented the broadest coalition of opposition groups to date, behind increasingly radical demands.\nDavid Gamkrelidze, a chairman of the New Rights party, noted that three months ago, his party was alone in calling for the president\u2019s resignation.\n\u201cToday almost all the political parties agree,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day more people and politicians understand that he has no capacity to overcome the crisis and that he is responsible for all these mistakes in Georgia and he must resign.\u201d\nMr. Saakashvili\u2019s popularity was at its lowest point in 2007, after the government used force to break up massive protest rallies.

{"date": "Sun, 06 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Lawmakers pulled Iraq back from the brink of a constitutional crisis on Sunday night, brokering a last-minute compromise that will allow for the first national elections since 2005.\nA deal on the election law has fallen apart before, underscoring the deep sectarian divide that remains in Iraq, despite a drop in violence. Fighting over the law also threatens to complicate the American withdrawal.\nAfter months of wrangling, the Iraqi Parliament gathered just before midnight to approve a deal that had been secured only hours before in closed-door talks.\n\u201cIt is a great achievement for Iraq,\u201d said Khalid al-Attiya, a deputy speaker of Parliament, shortly after the vote. The deal had been approved Sunday by Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish leaders, according to government officials, so it was unlikely to collapse again.\nAmerican and United Nations diplomats worked furiously over the weekend to secure the compromise, but were often unsure of what was happening as the discussions among Iraq\u2019s senior political leaders broke down time and again.\nAt one point on Sunday, a group of Western diplomats gathered in the dismal Parliament cafeteria, which was bombed by militants in 2007, comparing notes to see if they could make sense of the latest developments.\nThe deal was not very different from the original election law, which was vetoed by Tariq al-Hashimi, a Sunni and one of Iraq\u2019s two vice presidents. He said the law underrepresented Iraqis outside the country, who are largely Sunnis who fled the sectarian war that plunged the country into turmoil.\nEssentially, the dispute centered on the allocation of seats in Parliament, with each sect angling to get as many seats as possible in the areas where it felt strongest. Because a national census that was supposed to take place earlier this year was postponed, there is no accurate count of Iraqi citizens, and each political faction was wary of being shortchanged.\nThe initial effort to pass an election law was delayed on 11 separate occasions, but when an agreement was reached Nov. 8, it was hailed as a sign of progress.\nThat deal quickly fell apart when Mr. Hashimi used his constitutional authority to veto it.\nMr. Hashimi is one of three members of Iraq\u2019s Presidency Council, which also includes President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, and Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi, a Shiite. Together they have the power effectively to veto any law passed by Parliament.\nIn response to the first veto, Parliament passed a law that was viewed as even more unfavorable to Sunnis, prompting Mr. Hashimi to threaten a veto once again.\nFearful that another veto could delay elections indefinitely, top American officials have been appealing directly to the country\u2019s top lawmakers to step back from the abyss.\nThe White House said in a statement on Sunday that the United States welcomed adoption of the resolution on the Iraqi election law.\nYet as night fell in Baghdad on Sunday and no deal had been reached, aides to Mr. Hashimi waited outside the door of the speaker\u2019s office with a veto order at the ready.\nIt was only around 10 p.m. that the outlines of a deal became clear. Parliament would be expanded to 325 seats from 275, with 310 of those seats allotted to Iraq\u2019s 18 provinces and the remainder reserved for Iraqis living outside the country. But even after the deal had been largely agreed upon, lawmakers were still haggling over such issues as how the Christian minority would be represented.\nFor all the fighting, the compromise represented little change from the law passed Oct. 27 and then vetoed.\nPrime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki had warned that the delay could lead to increased violence, and there were fears of a replay of the 2005 election, which was largely boycotted by the Sunnis and fueled a sense of anger that bolstered Sunni militants.\nOver the weekend, a series of attacks underscored just how fragile the security gains remain. On Friday, militants in Saddam Hussein\u2019s hometown, Tikrit, killed four members of the police force, including a local commander who had gained a reputation as one of the staunchest foes of Sunni insurgents.\nWhile much of the recent violence has been concentrated in Sunni strongholds, there has been concern about Shiite militias regaining traction. In Basra, where more than 150 prisoners once affiliated with the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr have been released in recent weeks, there have been a spate of assassinations of political figures, according to local security officials.\nIf the deal holds, it will be a relief to American military commanders, who have been timing their withdrawal to the elections.\nWhile the American military role here has already been greatly reduced, the idea was to still have a sizable presence at the time of the election and during the seating of a new government.\nElection officials have said they would need at least 60 days\u2019 notice to write up ballots, secure polling stations and generally prepare for a vote. Barring another political meltdown, that means a date for the elections could be set for as early as the end of February.\nGen. Ray Odierno, the commander of American forces in Iraq, has said that while the military has built flexibility into the withdrawal timeline, the plan was to step up troop departures in the spring to meet President Obama\u2019s goal of having all combat troops out of the country by August 2010.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/world/middleeast/07iraq.html", "title": "After Delays, Deal Set on Iraq Election Law", "author": "MARC SANTORA and RIYADH MOHAMMED"}

The funeral was for the mother of Khairi Obaid al-Gughaifi, a minor official in Saddam Hussein\u2019s government, the security official said. It was not clear whether Mr. Gughaifi was among the victims. One of his brothers, a policeman, was killed, the security official said.\nIn the Anbar Province city of Falluja on Monday three bombs were detonated, killing one person and wounding five others.\nAnbar Province, which was at the center of the Sunni Arab insurgency against American forces, has calmed significantly since the end of 2007 when tribal leaders switched sides and joined Awakening Councils allied with the United States military and the Iraqi government in return for steady pay.\nBut as American troops have been leaving bases and camps throughout the province in large numbers during the past year, violence \u2014 much of which has been committed by suicide bombers \u2014 has increased. On July 30, a truck bomb exploded in the Anbar Province town of Qaim, killing 5 people and wounding 10 \u2014 the first attack there in two years. Two days later, in Haditha, 5 people were killed and 20 wounded after a car parked near a hospital exploded.\nOn Sept. 7, a suicide car bomber in the Anbar Province capital of Ramadi killed 7 police officers and wounded 9. Less than three weeks later, a suicide bomber drove his car into a police checkpoint in Ramadi, killing 3 people and wounding 10. And a week ago in Falluja, a suicide bomber driving a water tanker full of explosives killed 7 police officers and wounded 10 others.\nIn early September, Anbar Province officials had deemed the security situation in the province so safe that the local provincial council voted to remove concrete blast walls from in front of its Ramadi headquarters.\nBut as the violence has picked up, instead of having the walls removed officials have erected additional barriers.\nIn other violence on Monday, two police officers were killed after a roadside bomb exploded in the northern city of Mosul, and an explosive placed in a mound of trash killed a 10-year-old boy who was playing there, officials said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/world/middleeast/06iraq.html", "title": "6 Are Killed by Bomber at Funeral in West Iraq", "author": "TIMOTHY WILLIAMS"}

Now comes a mysterious virus that runs the risk of turning the country into a no-go zone in the minds of many travelers.\nRafael Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, president of the Mexico City Hotel Association, reported a 20 percent drop in national tourism to the capital over the weekend and said the effects of the crisis on international visitors were still being assessed. Daniel Loaeza, vice president of the National Restaurant Association, said the closing of restaurants for even a few days could mean significant damage to the industry.\nAlejandro Rojas, Mexico City\u2019s secretary of tourism, met with Rodolfo Elizondo, the national tourism director, and others in the industry on Sunday to assess how the health crisis could affect tourism and to mount an aggressive response.\n\u201cWe are going to come to an agreement to distribute to the world the real situation in Mexico,\u201d Mr. Rojas told the newspaper Reforma.\nStill, the news from health officials only seems to get worse, with the number of deaths believed tied to the flu virus rising to 103, according to government officials, and the number of people suspected to have been sickened across the country about 1,600 since April 13.\nMexican officials took pains to note that no government had issued an official ban on travel to Mexico. But there were worrisome indications on the horizon, with Hong Kong issuing a strong warning against travel here.\nFor those who had already arrived, many of the recommended tourist destinations, including historical sites, museums and top restaurants, have been shut down on the order of health officials. And Mayor Marcelo Ebrard told reporters on Sunday that if the epidemic grew worse he might order additional measures, including the closing of the public transportation system.\nDouble-decker tour buses continued to traverse Mexico\u2019s capital over the weekend, rolling past the majestic National Palace, areas in the expansive Chapultepec Park, including the zoo, and the Frida Kahlo Museum. But the tourists aboard, who took in the sights wearing face masks, were unable to go inside the popular attractions because of the emergency measures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a shame,\u201d said Elena Rogova, who was visiting from Moscow with a friend. \u201cWe wanted to go to the Anthropology Museum and the Frida Kahlo Museum and so many other museums. All we can do is walk.\u201d\nAnother visitor, Paula Sezenna, walking along the Paseo de la Reforma, found a silver lining to the crisis. Ms. Sezenna, who was on a business trip from Italy, said the normal crowds at the pyramids of Teotihuacan outside the capital on weekends had thinned considerably.\nWarned at a youth hostel that they should not go downtown, a group of women from Australia and New Zealand decided to go anyway, equipped with hand sanitizer and accepting masks from a soldier once they got to the Z\u00f3calo, the city\u2019s central square. \u201cWe put them on for photos,\u201d said Stephanie Gawne, 24, who professed not to be alarmed.\nBut Jessamyn Cull, 23, said she had been recovering from the flu when she arrived. \u201cI am a tad worried,\u201d she said, indicating that the group might leave Mexico soon and head for their next stop in Guatemala.\nThere was no apparent rush to leave the country at Mexico City\u2019s airport, although a few foreign tourists said in interviews there that they had changed their flights to return home early.\n\u201cI was afraid they would stop people from flying back to the United States,\u201d said Tom Dillon, 43, who was returning to New York.\nA soccer team from the German School of White Plains considered its trip a bust. The boys had arrived to play in a tournament on Friday and Saturday, only to find that all their matches had been canceled.\nThe United States Embassy in Mexico City, which has warned Americans about the effects of drug violence in a travel alert, said there were no constraints on travel between the United States and Mexico. But after Mexico decided to limit public gatherings, the embassy said it would suspend the processing of thousands of tourist visas this week.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/world/americas/27mexico.html", "title": "Mexican Tourism, Already Hurt by Violence, Bears Blow of a Health Scare", "author": "MARC LACEY"}

But it also raised broader questions about whether the software would lead to more censorship of the Internet in China and restrict freedom of expression.\n\u201cChina is putting companies in an untenable position by requiring them, with virtually no public notice, to pre-install software that appears to have broad-based censorship implications and network security issues,\u201d Mr. Locke said in a news release. The government did not release the text of the letter.\nThe letter, by two cabinet-rank officials, represents an escalation of the concern over the software plan. Last week United States officials met with their Chinese counterparts in Beijing to raise objections to the new policy.\nEd Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, one of several trade groups that have objected to the Chinese plan, said the letter represented a significant change in American policy.\n\u201cThe issue of Internet freedom and openness was something that should have been at the top of the U.S. international agenda and hasn\u2019t been,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cThis administration is far more in tune with and ready to support Internet openness.\u201d\nChina already has an elaborate system that blocks access to sites that discuss delicate topics like the Dalai Lama and Falun Gong, the banned spiritual movement.\nIn their statement, the American officials rejected the argument that the software was simply a way to block pornography.\n\"Protecting children from inappropriate content is a legitimate objective, but this is an inappropriate means and is likely to have a broader scope,\u201d Mr. Kirk said in the statement. \u201cMandating technically flawed Green Dam software and denying manufacturers and consumers freedom to select filtering software is an unnecessary and unjustified means to achieve that objective.\u201d\nSecurity experts have expressed concerns that once installed, the software might also be used to block other sorts of content or even to monitor the online activities of citizens.\nThe letter suggested that China\u2019s move might violate World Trade Organization rules because American companies were given only six weeks\u2019 notice to comply. While formal complaints to the trade organization are difficult and cumbersome, pointing to the regulations is another signal that the United States will continue to pursue the issue.\nWith only one week before the new rules are to go into effect, it is unclear if American computer companies will comply.\nPamela Bonney, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard, said the company was still studying the rules and seeking clarification. A spokesman for Dell did not return calls seeking comment.\nSeparately, access to Google\u2019s main search engine at Google.com and other services like Gmail was temporarily blocked in China on Wednesday. It was restored a few hours later.\nAccess to foreign Web sites in China can be erratic, and determining whether the government is responsible can be difficult.\nIt is not clear whether the blocking of Google\u2019s sites is related to a dispute that erupted last week between Google and Chinese authorities. The Chinese government disabled some search functions of Google\u2019s Chinese-language search engine, Google.cn, saying the site offered too many links to pornographic material.\nGoogle\u2019s license to operate in China requires that it not show pornographic sites.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/world/asia/25censor.html", "title": "U.S. Objects to China\u2019s Web Filtering", "author": "SAUL HANSELL"}

But fellow prisoners and officials have told them that his case was \u201cpolitical,\u201d she said, and that other inmates have been told to avoid him.\n\u201cOur family demands that they release him immediately and call to account those who have illegally detained him,\u201d Ms. Zhou said.\nMr. Zhou\u2019s partner, Zhang Yuewei, said in a telephone interview from their California home that he had gone back to China to see his parents because they were in poor health.\n\u201cHe also wanted to take his parents to the States to emigrate, so they could have a better life,\u201d she said.\nJohn Kusumi, the founder of the China Support Network, an organization in the United States formed after the 1989 protests, said that Mr. Zhou apparently was detained as he tried to cross from Hong Kong into mainland China in early October.\nMr. Zhou, who is also known by his English name Majer Zhou, fled China in the early 1990s and has been a permanent resident of the United States since 1993.\nA spokesman for the American Embassy in Beijing said that officials there had heard reports of the arrest and were looking into it but had no other comment.\nMr. Zhou, now 41, was an undergraduate at the China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing in 1989, when students began to flock to Tiananmen Square to honor Hu Yaobang, the reform-minded Chinese leader whose death set off the democracy protests.\nMr. Zhou was elected the first president of the new Students\u2019 Autonomous Union but lost the position after a disagreement over whether to proceed with a crucial demonstration in late April of that year. Mr. Zhou remained part of the democracy movement, however, and was in Tiananmen Square during the June 4 military assault.\nHe served two years in prison for his role in the protest, then fled to Hong Kong and, later, the United States. He tried to re-enter China in 1998 and was imprisoned for three more years.\nAlso on Wednesday, the Dui Hua Foundation, which advocates for human rights in China, lowered its estimate of the number of Tiananmen protesters who remained imprisoned.\nThe foundation, based in San Francisco, said it believed that about 30 people remained in jail, down from the 50 to 60 prisoners it had previously reported. The group lowered its estimate after Chinese officials notified it of the early release of several former protesters, and other researchers documented the status of 104 demonstrators who had been jailed in Beijing No. 2 Prison after the June 4 crackdown. All but six of those prisoners have been released, the foundation stated.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/world/asia/14china.html", "title": "China Holds an Ex-Leader of \u201989 Rallies, Family Says", "author": "MICHAEL WINES"}

The roof has shifted off its center. In the back yard, a white cherry tree is in full bloom, and the snow-capped Apennines rise in the distance.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, two days after a devastating earthquake, Alessia Tiberti, 30, cried as firefighters climbed up a ladder and entered her second-floor bedroom window. Below, the two family dogs squealed at the gate.\n\u201cI cannot tell you how sad I am,\u201d Ms. Tiberti said as she stood with her parents, Wanda and Rolando, outside their home in Paganica, one of the villages hardest hit by the earthquake here in the Abruzzo region east of Rome.\nStill, Ms. Tiberti smiled as the firefighters carried out a pile of clothes and some personal papers. The family, who plan to move to their beach house, later embraced the firemen, wishing them a good Easter.\nIt was unclear if the house would ever be habitable again, but Ms. Tiberti said the family did not care. \u201cWe touched death with our own hands,\u201d she said.\nAs the death toll rose to 272 Wednesday and rescue efforts continued, teams of firefighters from across Italy were escorting residents like the Tiberti family back to their homes and helping retrieve a few essentials: some clothes, car keys, a cellphone.\nThe firefighters were also hoping to salvage a touch of home for survivors struggling to cope with their futures. Thousands are facing long months living in the tent cities being set up by Italy\u2019s Civil Protection Agency.\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi put the number of homeless at about 28,000: 17,700 living in tent camps around the city of L\u2019Aquila, and 10,000 in hotels along the coast. That is higher than the estimates of 17,000 homeless reported by officials on Tuesday, but much lower than initially believed.\nSpeaking at a news briefing in L\u2019Aquila, Mr. Berlusconi said that it would take \u201ca month and a half, two months\u201d to have the total picture of the damage from the 6.3-magnitude quake. \u201cIt was much worse than I thought,\u201d he said, the ANSA news agency reported.\nThe prime minister, who has toured the area daily since Monday, also said that he would step up efforts to prevent looting.\nMr. Berlusconi was criticized in the news media for an earlier comment, made to a German television crew, that encouraged the displaced to treat their stay in the tent camps as \u201ca camping trip.\u201d He has since explained that he was trying to keep an optimistic tone, and many residents have praised the government\u2019s swift response to the crisis.\nSome funerals had already begun Wednesday, and hearses have become an increasingly common sight on local roads.\nOn Friday, a large outdoor funeral will be held for the victims on the grounds of a police training school in L\u2019Aquila because all the nearby churches have been destroyed or are unsafe.\nThe Vatican granted a special dispensation so the funeral Mass could take place on Good Friday, the only day that Mass is not celebrated, The Associated Press reported.\nPope Benedict XVI said he would visit the stricken area as soon as possible after Easter.\nAt the camp in Paganica, which houses 3,500 people, the authorities were settling in for the long haul. A mobile post office had been driven in.\n\u201cNow we have to set up a police station, then a church, then a health care center,\u201d said Andrea Pascucci, who is running the camp for the Civil Protection Agency.\nHe said that residents would eventually be given more substantial, semipermanent housing.\nAt lunchtime, a long line of homeless people, many of them with facial bruises and bandages, stretched to a trailer serving pasta, sausages and bread.\nAnna Maria De Paulis said she had slept in her car and had not eaten a real meal in two days.\nLooking around at the tents that might well be her future, she said, \u201cThings don\u2019t look good.\u201d\nBut there were small signs of improvement. Five red and black espresso machines had arrived in the mess tent.\n\u201cFinally today we had a coffee,\u201d said a smiling Serena Tenina. \u201cIt might seem like nothing, but to me it\u2019s at least a sign that things are moving forward.\u201d\nIn one tent, three generations of the Idrizi family, immigrants from Albania, lay on their cots and cooed over a 4-month-old granddaughter.\n\u201cLuckily we escaped,\u201d said Adem Idrizi, a 44-year-old carpenter, flanked by his wife, three daughters and a son.\nNone seemed terribly saddened to lose their house. \u201cIt was a rental,\u201d Mr. Idrizi said.\nOthers were more bereft.\n\u201cI worked an entire life to reach a certain position, and in five minutes it all collapsed,\u201d said Antonio Colaianni, 79 and a retired farmer, as he sat on a green army cot in a tent and tried on donated shoes in Onna, where 40 of the village\u2019s some 300 inhabitants had died.\nA few feet away, a 4-year-old girl stacked up blocks in a tower, then knocked them over again.\nDonations have begun pouring in. On Wednesday, Madonna pledged $500,000, according to The A.P., which reported that two of her grandparents were born near here.\nInterior Minister Roberto Maroni said that the search for survivors would continue until Sunday. \u201cThen,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will start to secure buildings and begin the process of reconstruction, which will not be easy or brief.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/world/europe/09quake.html", "title": "After Italy Quake, Homeless Struggle", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}

{"date": "Fri, 16 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Riots broke out once again in the Baltic states on Friday, this time in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, where a group of 7,000 gathered to protest planned economic austerity measures. A smaller group began throwing eggs and stones through the windows of government buildings until the police moved in, using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd.\nThe episode was nearly identical to one on Tuesday in Latvia, when a peaceful protest of 10,000 people erupted into violence.\nIn both countries, years of steady economic growth have come to a jarring halt, and citizens are facing layoffs and cuts in wages. In each case, the authorities were left wondering whether they were facing organized activism or just the anger of people whose expectations have been disappointed. \u201cI think this is just the beginning,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cWe should expect this to happen in many places.\u201d\nLike its neighbor, Latvia, Lithuania has enjoyed a reputation as a \u201cBaltic Tiger,\u201d buoyed by foreign investment, a housing boom and annual growth rates of around 8 percent. Although Lithuania is not facing as dire an outlook as Latvia, economists predict a 5 percent drop in gross domestic product there next year, and the newly elected Parliament has announced tough austerity measures: workers in the public sector will see pay cuts of up to 15 percent, pensions will fall and an array of taxes will rise.\nThe Friday demonstration was organized by trade unions, and about 1,500 people were present when violence broke out, said Danute Daunoraviciute, a police spokeswoman, in a telephone interview. She said some protesters had prepared for violence by bringing gasoline-filled bottles. More than 80 people were arrested and 15 injured in the fray, including one protester whose finger was shot off by a rubber bullet.\nMs. Daunoraviciute said that it did not appear that specific political organizations had been behind the violence. \u201cIt was a good chance for people to express their social unhappiness,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were just angry and tired.\u201d\nThe authorities are looking closely at the question of \u201cwhether they were planned provocations or simply an emotional reaction,\u201d said Rita Grumadaite, a spokesman for Lithuania\u2019s president, Valdas Adamkus. Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius told reporters that he believed the violence was scripted. \u201cThere are forces that are interested in destabilization and chaos in Lithuania, and they are using the public\u2019s dismay over painful reforms to achieve their hostile plans,\u201d he said, according to Reuters.\nIn Latvia, people were still reeling from Tuesday\u2019s riots, the worst there since the fall of the Soviet Union. The largest party in the ruling parliamentary coalition, which was sharply criticized by demonstrators, moved to dissolve Parliament and prepare for spring elections, saying that was \u201cthe only possibility to overcome the crisis and return the country to the path of stability.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to bring down the Parliament, and through that the government,\u201d said Krisjanis Karins, a member of Parliament and former leader of the opposition New Era party. \u201cIt\u2019s already happening, and the pace is such that nobody really understands.\u201d\nMr. Aslund, the economist, said that the Baltic nations were encountering unrest because their economies were \u201coverheated,\u201d but that similar outbreaks were likely to spread throughout the former Soviet Union. On average, he said, post-Soviet countries have experienced a decade of 8 or 9 percent annual growth, and people have grown to expect it. He said he expected \u201cmassive blowups\u201d in Russia and Ukraine, as well as Tajikistan, which will have to absorb as many as one million unemployed guest workers.\nIn neighboring Estonia, the third of the Baltic tigers, all was quiet on Friday night. Estonia, which enjoyed double-digit growth in recent years, is likely to see its gross domestic product contract in 2009. Still, Marko Mihkelson, a member of the Estonian Parliament, said he thought Estonians would deal with the trouble through political debate. \u201cIt is our chance to show that our democracy is much more mature than to just go out into the street and throw things in the windows,\u201d he said.\nThe financial meltdown is not the only factor throwing Baltic countries off balance this winter, said Julianne Smith, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The war between Russia and Georgia and the gas deadlock between Russia and Ukraine underlined their vulnerability, she said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve spent the better part of the last two decades transforming their economies,\u201d she said. \u201cSuddenly, they wake up and they are no longer the Baltic tigers. When you pair that with the energy concern and acts of Russian intimidation, it definitely can be described as the perfect storm.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/world/europe/17lithuania.html", "title": "Baltic Riots Spread to Lithuania in the Face of Deteriorating Economic Conditions", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}
{"date": "Wed, 03 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 Soaked in sweat, his heart racing, Chen Guang descended the steps of China\u2019s Great Hall of the People and aimed his automatic rifle at the sea of student protesters occupying Tiananmen Square. A 17-year-old soldier from the countryside, Mr. Chen and his comrades had just been given chilling orders: to clear the symbolic heart of the nation, even if it meant spilling blood.\n\u201cWe were assured there would be no legal consequences if we opened fire,\u201d Mr. Chen recalled in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cMy only hope was that the students would not put up a fight.\u201d\nTwenty years after Chinese troops shot their way into the center of Beijing, killing hundreds of people and wounding many more, Mr. Chen provided a rare window into the military crackdown that re-established the Communist Party\u2019s supremacy after six weeks of mass unrest and then, for most Chinese, disappeared in an official whitewash.\nSpeaking publicly for the first time \u2014 and defying security officials who have told him to keep silent \u2014 he explained how soldiers from the 65th Group Army dressed in civilian clothes on June 3 and stealthily made their way to the Great Hall on Tiananmen Square\u2019s western edge. At midnight, with clips of ammunition slung across their chests, they faced off against demonstrators, the air filled with the singing of students and the sound of gunfire.\n\u201cI can assure you I didn\u2019t shoot anyone,\u201d he said.\nNow an artist and a bit of a provocateur living on the outskirts of Beijing, Mr. Chen said he spent the next 20 years suppressing memories of that day. But last year he began working on a series of paintings based on hundreds of photographs, taken at his unit\u2019s request while he was on the square. They include gauzy images of protesters commandeering a public bus, exuberant students parading with pro-democracy banners and soldiers feeding their abandoned encampments into bonfires.\n\u201cFor 20 years I tried to bury this episode, but the older you get the more these things float to the surface,\u201d he said, chain-smoking in his apartment. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for my experiences, my truth, to be shared with the rest of the world.\u201d\nBut by publicizing his experiences through his art, Mr. Chen risks provoking the authorities, who are eager to suppress discussion of the episode and excise June 4 from public memory. In recent weeks, as the anniversary of the crackdown approached, the police have harassed or detained dissidents who they feared might draw attention to June 4. Last spring, Zhang Shijun, a former soldier from north China, was arrested after telling The Associated Press that he regretted his role in crushing the pro-democracy protests.\nLast summer, after local galleries refused to show his paintings, Mr. Chen posted them on the Internet. Within hours, however, they had been taken down.\nA slightly built man who talks softly and without emotion, Mr. Chen says he is not worried about the consequences of speaking out, even if he has received warnings to keep his paintings to himself.\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just talking about my experiences.\u201d\nRaised in rural Henan Province, the son of a factory worker, he dropped out of high school at 15 because, he said, he was a poor student. He wanted to be an artist, but everyone told him that was no way to make a living. \u201cThe pressure from my family was intense so I decided to join the army,\u201d he said. Because enlistees had to be at least 18, he lied about his age.\nLess than a year later, in mid-April, Beijing was convulsed by protests touched off by the death of Hu Yaobang, the Communist Party chief who had been forced to resign to take responsibility for what some rival leaders viewed as reckless economic and political reforms.\nIsolated in their barracks three hours north of the city, Mr. Chen said he and his fellow soldiers understood little about protests. They knew only what military officers told them: \u201cthat bad people were trying to destroy the nation that was established with the death of martyrs,\u201d he recalled.\nOn May 19, they were given orders to enter the city. But their path was blocked by throngs of students and average Beijing residents supporting the demonstrators. For two days the troops were lectured to and fed by strangers while the nation\u2019s military leaders debated what to do.\nOn the third day, his unit withdrew, but Mr. Chen said the episode left him confused. \u201cWe were told they were bad people but the students seemed so honest and earnest,\u201d he said.\nAfter nearly two weeks isolated in their barracks, the soldiers were given civilian clothes and told to make their way to the Great Hall in groups of two or three. Mr. Chen said his assignment was far more unnerving. He said he was the only passenger in a double-length bus with its seats removed and its interior filled to the windowsills with guns and ammunition.\nUnfed and terrified, the soldiers, most of them teenagers, waited inside the Great Hall while military commanders, perched at a second-floor window, strategized the assault. Around midnight, power to the square was cut and the soldiers eased their way down the broad steps to the street. To frighten the students into leaving, he said, the men were told to fire into the air. The tactic had the desired effect.\nBy 2 a.m., tens of thousands of students were weeping and singing the Internationale as they filed out of the square. Not long afterward, armored vehicles rolled in. One went to work on the Goddess of Democracy, a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 statue that art students had built just days earlier. \u201cIt took them three rams before it fell to the ground,\u201d Mr. Chen said.\nMost of the deaths in the crackdown, according to multiple accounts of the incident, occurred in the streets leading toward the square, not in the square itself.\nLess than a year after the suppression, Mr. Chen enrolled in the military\u2019s art school, then transferred to the Chinese Academy of Fine Art. In 1995, he left the army.\nIn those early years, Mr. Chen was drawn to photography and performance art, creating work that was lurid and provocative. He spent months filming prostitutes and took photographs of himself copulating on the Great Wall. He also produced a series of sexually explicit photos of himself posing with an elderly intellectual man who had been persecuted by the Communist Party. \u201cI wanted to portray myself having a visceral connection to someone who had experienced China\u2019s tumultuous history,\u201d he said.\nAlthough none of his early work refers directly to Tiananmen Square, he said most of it had been influenced by the trauma there. \u201cEven if a connection is hard to see, everything I do is touched by that experience,\u201d he said. Mr. Chen said he saw soldiers bloodied by rocks and a protestor having his head rifle butted by soldiers. But the image that haunts him most is rather mundane. As he was cleaning up the square that morning, he spotted a luxuriant ponytail amid the detritus of crushed bicycles and tangled blankets.\nThe clump of hair, held by a purple band, had been crudely shorn, perhaps as an act of protest but possibly the result of something more sinister. \u201cIt was a startling image,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about that hair and why it had been cut off.\u201d\nIn recent months, he has produced a score of self-portraits. In each, his neck, shoulder and chest are littered with scraps of hair. He cuts his own hair only every year or two and then stores the clippings in his apartment. So far he has filled the equivalent of two dozen coffee cans, raw material for a future project.\nHe said he did his most intense work every June, around the same time that he was hit with wrenching stomach pain. It is the same twisting of the gut that he first experienced on the square, he said.\nIt was around this time last year that Mr. Chen decided to revisit the cache of photographs he had taken in 1989. Just before the assault on the square began, Mr. Chen\u2019s commander handed him a camera and 20 rolls of film and told him to wander freely. When it came time to hand back the film, he hid three rolls in his army-issued satchel.\nHe said the photographs inspired him to take on a subject that few in China care, or dare, to touch. His paintings are artistic depictions of history, he insisted, not expressions of right or wrong. The images are largely dispassionate, although Mr. Chen has rendered them in a washed-out, melancholy blue.\n\u201cI have no regrets about what I did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I feel that this tragedy could have been avoided. Maybe if we start talking about this event, we can prevent it from happening again.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/world/asia/04soldier.html", "title": "Tiananmen Square Scars Soldier Turned Artist", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}
{"date": "Tue, 08 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NONGOMA, South Africa \u2014 The bull was badly outnumbered, and while its muscular body, thick black hide and rock-hard horns offered significant advantages, this was not a brawl the animal was likely to win. Forty Zulu warriors were circling about, there to kill it with their bare hands.\nPenned up in the royal kraal, the bull trotted around for a while, looking nervously for an escape. Then it hesitated, and the warriors \u2014 all in their late teens or early twenties \u2014 moved in, their hands reaching for anything to grasp, the tail, the legs, those horns.\nThe killing of the bull is part of Ukweshwama, an annual ceremony that celebrates a new harvest. It is a day of prayer when Zulus thank their creator and their ancestors. By tradition, a new regiment of young warriors is asked to confront a bull to prove its courage, inheriting the beast\u2019s strength as it expires. It is believed this power then transfers to the Zulu king.\nUsually, the Ukweshwama is viewed by outsiders as little more than a curiosity. King Goodwill Zwelithini is largely a ceremonial figure these days, his monarchy more an emotional bond than a political reality. But this year, a South African animal rights group took up the cause of the doomed bull, assailing the slaying as unnecessarily cruel. Fissures were pried open in South African society, and the back-and-forth between the two sides became ugly.\nCritics of the ritual were condemned as neo-colonialists trying once again to stamp out African culture. \u201cThis is reminiscent of the arrival of European settlers on our shores who declared that our people were barbaric heathens who needed to be civilized,\u201d wrote Zizi Kodwa, a spokesman for President Jacob Zuma, who is Zulu himself and a passionate defender of Zulu traditions.\nLeaders of Animal Rights Africa had never attended the Ukweshwama, but they said they had gathered anonymous accounts from some who had. The depiction quoted in the group\u2019s news releases was a grisly portrayal.\n\u201cFor 40 minutes, dozens trampled the bellowing, groaning bull, wrenched its head around by the horns to try to break its neck, pulled its tongue out, stuffed sand in its mouth and even tried to tie its penis in a knot.\u201d\nMany people were horrified. Shouldn\u2019t traditions be revised to fit a modern view of the world, they asked. Otherwise, culture is used as an excuse for outrages like the forced circumcision of women and the killing of supposed witches.\nFred Khumalo, a well-known journalist and commentator, said too many \u201cnegligible beliefs\u201d were supported with the catchall defense of tradition. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the protracted debauchery of pulling a bull by its testicles and pulling its tongue out, seen in so many pictures recently,\u201d he wrote.\nActually, few photos of the ritual exist. Cameras are generally not allowed at the Ukweshwama when it comes time to kill the bull. So what actually goes on inside the kraal?\nSeveral experts on Zulu culture insisted that the critics were ill informed. Ndele Ntshangase, a lecturer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said the technique used in killing the bull was to deftly grab its legs and horns and then pull it down. The animal was dispatched with a skillful twist of the neck.\n\u201cThere is no question of torture,\u201d he said. \u201cThe duration of the killing may be longer than if a gun was used. But the intention is to kill the bull as fast as it can be done. It\u2019s over in a few minutes.\u201d\nOther defenders of the rite disparaged the animal rights activists as hypocrites. Why weren\u2019t they campaigning against hunters who killed animals just to place a stuffed trophy on a wall \u2014 or sport fishermen who snared their catch with a painful hook only to release it back into the water?\nBut Animal Rights Africa persisted and took the matter to court, where Judge Nic van der Reyden was implored to stop the ritual. He said it was a difficult decision to make. But killing the bull was an important Zulu tradition, he finally agreed, and Zulus were the biggest ethnic group in the country, numbering more than 10 million. Interfering with the ceremony would be like asking Catholics to stop taking communion, he said.\nThe judge was further troubled by unforeseeable consequences: \u201cIf I rule that the bull should not be killed, it means that the power will not be transferred to the king,\u201d he said, according to wire service reports. \u201cLet\u2019s say the king is struck by lightning after the ruling. People will say it is because I have interrupted their ritual.\u201d\nLast Friday, Judge van der Reyden dismissed the request to stop the ceremony, and on Saturday, with clouds hanging low above the Enyokeni Palace, Zulu men turned off their cellphones and exchanged their everyday street clothes for leopard skins and sandals. They carried clubs and shields and danced along the road leading to the sliding metal gate of the royal homestead here in the hilly north of KwaZulu-Natal Province.\nOnce inside the kraal, a circular palisade of intertwined timber, the men continued the chanting and dancing, taking slow steps back and forth, shaking their clubs toward the ground. The king himself eventually joined this group of warriors. The more important of the dignitaries wore elaborate headdresses with decorative feathers. The king\u2019s was a striking nest of black with outward thrusts of orange.\nLate in the afternoon, a lectern was placed on the soggy ground and the king opened the leather binder that held a lengthy speech. President Zuma, arriving late and dressed in a business suit, stood respectfully behind him.\nThe king\u2019s remarks, delivered in Zulu, included a rebuke to anyone who questioned his people\u2019s love of animals. He also berated traitors who had photographed the ceremony and handed the pictures to \u201cenemies.\u201d\nWith that, journalists were ordered away from the kraal, left to observe the killing of the bull atop plastic chairs from a distance. Spectators inside did not see much anyway. The bull was down within minutes, its body concealed behind the long limbs of its many attackers. By the account of some participants, veteran warriors had to be recruited to properly snap the animal\u2019s neck.\nThe throng of men did not break up for about 20 minutes, and then the dancing and chanting began again. Several feet away, the bull, no longer the center of attention, lay motionless in the mud, its bulky head wrenched far past the limits of its natural swivel.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/world/africa/09safrica.html", "title": "Spilling the Blood of Bulls to Preserve Zulu Tradition", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}
{"date": "Mon, 09 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 After years of sharply reduced political violence in Northern Ireland, the gunning down of a group of British soldiers by suspected Irish Republican Army dissidents has shaken the Protestant and Catholic communities and challenged the still fragile cohesion of the province\u2019s power-sharing government.\nSuch is the concern that Prime Minister Gordon Brown flew to Northern Ireland on Monday after politicians from both communities joined Sunday in condemning the attack on the soldiers and two pizza deliverymen outside a British Army base in Antrim, 15 miles northwest of Belfast. Calling the soldier\u2019s killers \u201ccallous murderers,\u201d Mr. Brown insisted that the shootings would not unravel the Northern Ireland peace effort. \u201cThe political process will not and can never be shaken,\u201d he said, according to Britain\u2019s Press Association news agency.\nMr. Brown traveled to the barracks where the soldiers were killed and planned also to meet political leaders in the province. \u201cThese are callous people who carried out executions outside these barracks,\u201d he said of the killers. \u201cI believe the whole population of Northern Ireland is saying that these people have got to be hunted down and brought to justice as quickly as possible.\u201d\nThe attack, which took place late Saturday, killed two soldiers and seriously wounded two other soldiers and the deliverymen, who somehow survived follow-up volleys of automatic fire as they lay sprawled on the road outside the base\u2019s main gate.\nIt was the first deadly assault on the British military in Northern Ireland since an I.R.A. sniper shot a soldier in 1997, a year before the Good Friday peace agreement, with the United States as a broker, set out a road map for ending sectarian violence in the province of 1.8 million people.\nPoliticians in Northern Ireland said the shooting had the earmarks of a bid by dissident republicans to destabilize the power-sharing government. It took office nearly two years ago after 30 years of violence that killed 3,700 people.\nA dissident faction that calls itself the Real I.R.A. and that has rejected the government claimed responsibility for the attack in a telephone call to a reporter in Belfast from the Dublin-based Sunday Tribune newspaper. The police said the group, after carrying out a 1998 bombing in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh that killed 29 people, had undertaken a sporadic but mostly marginal campaign of attacks, mainly against the province\u2019s police force. They described the group as a shadow of the main I.R.A., with few committed gunmen, a limited budget and a shortage of weapons.\nOutrage across the province on Sunday was compounded by the brutality of the attackers. The police said that three men in a stolen vehicle had tracked the deliverymen to the Massareene base on Antrim\u2019s outskirts. Police said two of the attackers then served as gunmen, advancing on the victims, still firing, after an initial fusillade as the soldiers collected their pizzas.\nThe attack had echoes of the harsh tactics used during the province\u2019s most violent years by the I.R.A., which made a policy of killing not only soldiers and policemen but also civilians whose work supported them. That violence, and attacks by Protestant paramilitaries, killed as many as 300 people a year at the height of the sectarian struggle, but the advent of power sharing has made political killings a relative rarity. Last year, only three deaths were attributed to sectarian attacks.\nBut fears had grown recently that attacks by dissident republicans were mounting. The dissidents wounded several police officers in 15 attacks in the past 17 months, and a 250-pound bomb was defused last month outside another army base. Sir Hugh Orde, the province\u2019s police chief, announced last week that concern about the attacks had caused him to ask for help from a \u201csmall number\u201d of troops from the army\u2019s Special Reconnaissance Regiment, an intelligence-gathering unit based on the British mainland.\nThat decision ran counter to the reduction of army units under the peace accord, which has cut the pre-1998 British garrison from a high of 25,000 troops to barely 4,000, concentrated on 10 bases that no longer play active roles in the province\u2019s security.\nThe men killed Saturday were from an engineering unit only hours away from deployment to Afghanistan. The British military identified them on Monday as Mark Quinsey, 23, and Patrick Azimkar, 21.\nOn Sunday, as the police announced that they had recovered the Antrim gunmen\u2019s getaway vehicle at Randalstown, about five miles west of Antrim, Protestant leaders said the attack had vindicated the police\u2019s decision to call on the army intelligence specialists. The move was condemned last week by Martin McGuinness, the former I.R.A. commander who is the province\u2019s deputy first minister, as \u201cstupid and dangerous\u201d for reviving memories of the role played by army intelligence units in strikes against the I.R.A. in the past.\nBut that disagreement was stilled as leaders on both sides of the historic divide joined in condemning the attack, showing a common front that many in Northern Ireland saw as a measure of how far the province had come under the power-sharing accord. Mr. McGuinness and Peter Robinson, the province\u2019s first minister and head of the Democratic Unionist Party, the most powerful of the mainly Protestant parties in the province, announced they were postponing a joint investment-promoting trip to the United States that was to have begun on Sunday.\n\u201cThe people responsible for this tragic incident are signaling that they want to restart the war,\u201d Mr. McGuinness said. \u201cWell, I deny their right to do that.\u201d\nGerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., described the Antrim gunmen as \u201cmerchants of doom\u201d and their attack as \u201cwrong and counterproductive.\u201d\nShaun Woodward, the minister responsible for Northern Ireland, said the government would not allow anger at the Antrim shooting to destabilize the power-sharing accord.\nDespite lingering resentments and widely different prescriptions for the province\u2019s long-term future among leaders of the Protestant and Catholic communities, the power-sharing arrangement has worked better than pessimists feared when it began 22 months ago. That followed years of delay, recrimination and back-pedaling, as well as violence, that continued after the Good Friday pact was signed in 1998.\n\u201cWhat really matters is that we do not allow the very small number of people who make up these groups to derail the peace process,\u201d Mr. Woodward said Sunday in a BBC interview, referring to the dissident republicans.\nHe said Mr. McGuinness and Mr. Robinson, with their parties, had \u201ctransformed the politics of Northern Ireland,\u201d and it was up to the province\u2019s people to help the police by reporting anything they knew of the Antrim killers.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/world/europe/10ireland.html", "title": "British Premier Visits Northern Ireland", "author": "JOHN F.

In the new scramble for Africa\u2019s riches, China sought a hefty share.\nWith a no-strings-attached approach and a strong appetite for risk, China seemed to offer Africa a complete economic and political alternative to the heavily conditioned aid and economic restructuring that Western countries and international aid agencies pressed on Africa for years, often with uninspiring consequences. Rising China, seeking friends and resources, seemed to be issuing blank checks.\nToday, China\u2019s quest for commodities has not stalled. State-owned companies are bargain-hunting for copper and iron ore in more stable places like Zambia and Liberia. But Chinese companies are now driving harder bargains and avoiding some of the most chaotic corners of the continent. African governments facing falling revenues are realizing that they may still need the West\u2019s help after all.\n\u201cWe have seen in the recent past Chinese companies wade into countries nobody else would,\u201d said Philippe de Pontet, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a private research firm. \u201cThat may be changing.\u201d\nIn 2007 China announced a $9 billion deal with Congo for access to its giant trove of copper, cobalt, tin and gold in exchange for developing roads, schools, dams and railways needed to rebuild a country roughly the size of Western Europe and shattered by more than a decade of war.\nBut that deal is now in doubt as falling prices have left Congo in a much weaker negotiating position. It also suddenly finds itself needing the help of the International Monetary Fund, which has objected to writing off the country\u2019s old debt even as Congo takes on what amounts to new mineral-backed loans from China. Congo\u2019s political and ethnic turmoil remains deep, and its economy is near collapse.\nA year ago those factors seemed irrelevant. Chinese companies did not flinch from making deals to search for oil in the pirate-infested waters off Somalia, or to mine industrial metals in places like Zimbabwe.\nUnlike many Western companies, Chinese state oil companies had no qualms about doing business with the government of Sudan, which has become an international pariah because of the conflict in Darfur.\nChina espoused a new model for African investment: mutually beneficial trade between sovereign nations with none of the meddling so common among Western donors and investors, with their demands for labor and environmental standards, as well as respect for democracy and human rights.\nThese policies proved popular among African governments, and trade between Africa and China grew to more than $100 billion by 2008, from less than $10 million in the 1980s. African leaders spoke openly about China\u2019s offer of an alternative to the edicts of Western-dominated institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\nBut here in Guinea, which has some of the world\u2019s largest deposits of bauxite, an ore needed for making aluminum, that hope has all but collapsed.\n\u201cThe Chinese have changed their strategy,\u201d said Ibrahima Sory Diallo, a senior economist in Guinea\u2019s Ministry of Finance and an advocate for Chinese investment. \u201cThey are not going to inject $5 billion into an unstable country in an uncertain market climate.\u201d\nFrench colonists once called Guinea a geological scandal, so rich are its deposits of valuable minerals. Despite years of mining and billions in profits, Guinea remains one of the poorest and least developed countries in Africa.\nSo it is no surprise that Guinea\u2019s government, first under Lansana Cont\u00e9, the strongman who ruled for 24 years until his death last year, and the junta that replaced him, wanted to tap China\u2019s cash and building expertise.\nChina\u2019s approach to securing minerals in Africa has been to sign agreements to build huge projects in exchange for minerals. In Angola, this kind of arrangement has guaranteed Chinese access to oil in Africa\u2019s fourth largest oil producer, which is now booming after emerging tattered and broke from a vicious civil war that lasted decades. Chinese and Angolan officials trumpeted this partnership as a model for Chinese investment in the continent, a win-win relationship benefiting both countries.\nBut that formulation has proved problematic in an economic downturn. African governments are now realizing that these deals are in essence loans against future revenue, and falling prices could leave them saddled with giant piles of debt.\nThat is what appears to have happened in Congo. At current prices Congo would struggle to meet the stringent production targets in the Chinese deal, said Patricia Feeney, executive director of Rights and Accountability in Development, a Britain-based advocacy group.\n\u201cThe Congolese have raised expectations so much that they could rely on Chinese and turn their backs on Western donors, and in the process they have probably managed to alienate people who were willing to help,\u201d Ms. Feeney said.\nIn Guinea, China has backed away from what Guinean officials portrayed as a done deal to build a much-needed $1 billion hydroelectric dam.\n\u201cThe dam is not a gift; it is an investment,\u201d said Mr. Huo, the Chinese ambassador. \u201cThat is what win-win means.\u201d\nGuineans are increasingly suspicious of Chinese investment. Many people see Chinese companies as being just as exploitative as Western ones, if not more so. After the military took power in December, it raided Chinese companies suspected of selling fake medicines, but the raids degenerated into open looting of Chinese businesses, tapping a vein of resentment long suppressed.\nHamidou Cond\u00e9 works bare-chested under the relentless sun, digging a hole for the foundation of a new hospital being built by a Chinese company, yet another symbol of Chinese-Guinean friendship.\nMr. Cond\u00e9, 35, who has two wives and four children, said that he had been digging in the hard rock with a shovel, pick and ax for two months, but that he had yet to receive any pay from his Chinese taskmasters.\n\u201cWe work like slaves,\u201d Mr. Cond\u00e9 said. \u201cAnd like slaves we are not paid. The Chinese bring nothing good to Guinea.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/world/africa/26chinaafrica.html", "title": "As Chinese Investment in Africa Drops, Hope Sinks", "author": "LYDIA POLGREEN"}
{"date": "Wed, 04 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ROME \u2014 Responding to an extraordinary burst of global outrage, especially in Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s native Germany, the Vatican for the first time on Wednesday called on a recently rehabilitated bishop to take back his statements denying the Holocaust.\nLate last month, the pope revoked the excommunications of four schismatic bishops from the ultraconservative Society of St. Pius X, including Bishop Richard Williamson, a Briton, who in an interview broadcast last month denied the existence of the Nazi gas chambers.\nIn a statement issued Wednesday, the Vatican Secretariat of State said that Bishop Williamson \u201cmust absolutely, unequivocally and publicly distance himself from his positions on the Shoah,\u201d or Holocaust, or else he would not be allowed to serve as a bishop in the Roman Catholic Church.\nThe statement said that the bishop\u2019s recent comments denying the Holocaust had been \u201cunknown to the Holy Father at the time he revoked the excommunication.\u201d\nEfforts to reach Bishop Williamson were unsuccessful, and he issued no public response. The bishop has a history of public statements denying the Holocaust.\nOutside Seminario Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Corredentora, the bishop\u2019s bucolic seminary with its own farm in La Reja, Argentina, a small town near Buenos Aires, a priest who came to the door said that Bishop Williamson would not comment until he had spoken with his superiors.\nPope Benedict has stumbled before in his nearly four-year papacy, most notably when he offended Muslims in 2006 by citing a medieval scholar who said Islam brought things \u201cevil and inhuman.\u201d But the internal controversy created by Bishop Williamson\u2019s rehabilitation is unlike anything the Vatican has faced in recent decades.\nWednesday\u2019s unsigned statement \u2014 a rare case of the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic arm furthering earlier remarks by the pope himself \u2014 not only showed an age-old institution grappling with the 24-hour news cycle. It also seemed to be a clear indication that the Vatican was facing nothing less than an internal and external political crisis.\nThe day before, in a rare criticism from the head of a government, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany called on the pope to clarify his position on the Holocaust, saying his previous remarks had not been sufficient.\nSeveral prominent figures in the German Catholic Church joined in the criticism, and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops also issued a statement condemning Bishop Williamson.\nBut the statement from the Vatican Secretariat of State seemed to go a long way toward calming the uproar. The chairman of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch, praised it, saying Wednesday that the Vatican had \u201cclarified in an unequivocal way that every form of anti-Semitism should be condemned.\u201d\nThe Vatican statement noted Benedict\u2019s remarks last week in which he expressed his \u201cfull and unequivocal solidarity\u201d with Jews and condemned all attempts to deny the Holocaust. But it went far beyond the pope\u2019s earlier remarks, which had never mentioned Bishop Williamson by name.\nThe four bishops are from the traditionalist Society of St. Pius X, founded in 1970 by a French archbishop, Marcel Lefebvre, to protest the liberalizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council, or Vatican II, including liturgical changes, a commitment to ecumenism and religious liberty.\nThe society\u2019s 600 priests and estimated 400,000 followers are on the far right of the world\u2019s one billion Catholics. They are particularly opposed to a Vatican II document that absolved contemporary Jews of responsibility for the crucifixion of Jesus.\nThe four bishops were excommunicated by Pope John Paul II in 1988 after Archbishop Lefebvre consecrated them without a papal mandate. The schismatic society has no legal standing within the Catholic Church.\nBenedict has said he revoked the excommunications in an effort to heal a rift within the church. Last week, he called them a gesture of \u201ccompassion\u201d and a first step on a longer path toward the society\u2019s full reconciliation with the church.\nThe statement from the Vatican on Wednesday also addressed questions about what conditions the society would have to meet before being fully welcomed back into the fold, saying it would have to offer its \u201cfull recognition of the Second Vatican Council\u201d to receive \u201crecognition\u201d by the church.\nJewish groups on Wednesday welcomed the statement by the Secretariat of State.\n\u201cThis was the sign the Jewish world has been waiting for,\u201d Ronald S. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, said in a statement.\nHe noted that Bishop Williamson\u2019s anti-Semitism was not \u201can isolated case\u201d in the Society of St. Pius X, and he called on the pope \u201cto ensure that the achievements of four decades of Catholic-Jewish dialogue are not being damaged by a small minority of people who want to divide rather than unite.\u201d\nRabbi David Rosen, the American Jewish Committee\u2019s international director of interreligious affairs, said the Vatican\u2019s \u201cclear reiteration\u201d that the Society of St. Pius X would be allowed back into the church only if it accepted the teachings of Vatican II was \u201cmost reassuring.\u201d\n\u201cHad all this been expressed at the outset,\u201d he added, \u201cwe could have avoided the unnecessary damage and distress.\u201d\nAn internal doctrinal issue exploded into a firestorm after a Swedish television channel broadcast an interview days before the revocations were announced on Jan. 24, in which Bishop Williamson said he believed that no more than 300,000 Jews died in the Holocaust and that \u201cthere were no gas chambers.\u201d\nNowhere was outrage at the pope\u2019s decision to rehabilitate Bishop Williamson stronger than in Germany, where Holocaust denial is a crime.\nMrs. Merkel\u2019s remarks on Tuesday tapped into a growing well of German discontent with the Vatican, including within the German Catholic Church.\nIn a broadcast on German television on Monday, the bishop of Mainz, Cardinal Karl Lehmann, a former chairman of the German bishops\u2019 conference and an influential and respected figure, said that the pope\u2019s decision to rehabilitate Bishop Williamson had been \u201ca disaster for all Holocaust survivors.\u201d\nCardinal Lehmann singled out Cardinal Dar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos, the president of the Vatican commission in charge of relations with the Society of St. Pius X, who said last week that the commission had not been aware of Bishop Williamson\u2019s comments before revoking the excommunications. Cardinal Lehmann said that there \u201chad to be consequences for those who are responsible here.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the archbishop of Berlin, Cardinal Georg Sterzinsky, called for a review of Bishop Williamson\u2019s reinstatement. \u201cMy sense is that a different outcome would be reached,\u201d he told the newspaper Bild. \u201cAnd if it is determined that mistakes were made, no matter on what level, then an apology has to be issued.\u201d\nIn a public declaration issued last weekend, Bishop Gebhard Fuerst of Rottenburg-Stuttgart in southern Germany said that revoking the excommunications had led to \u201cexternal and internal alienation from the church on the part of many believers, to a betrayal of trust especially among Jewish sisters and brothers in their relationship to the church and to a considerable disturbance in the Christian-Jewish dialogue.\u201d\nThat the revocation of an excommunication could erupt into such a crisis speaks to what some see as a failure of leadership within the Vatican.\nConversations with a variety of people inside and outside the Vatican portray an intellectual pope increasingly isolated from the Vatican administration. Many point to a lack of communication between the handful of cardinals responsible for revoking the excommunications and other members of the curia who might have opposed the move.\nWriting on his blog, Sandro Magister, a correspondent for the weekly magazine L\u2019Espresso and one of Italy\u2019s most highly respected Vatican experts, pointed to a \u201cdouble disaster\u201d of \u201cgovernance and communication\u201d within the church.\nCardinal Walter Kasper, a German who directs the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and who is the liaison for Vatican-Jewish relations, has said he was not consulted before the pope\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThere were certainly management errors on the part of the curia, I want to be clear about that,\u201d Cardinal Kasper said in an unusually direct interview with Vatican Radio\u2019s German service on Monday.\nIn the statement from the Secretariat of State on Wednesday, the pope asked the clergy and all the faithful \u201cto support the very delicate and weighty mission of the successor of the Apostle Peter, who is custodian of the unity of the church.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/world/europe/05pope.html", "title": "Vatican Move on Bishop Exposes Fissures of Church", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}

But as so often happens in Italy, a country that appears to handle last-minute emergencies better than long-term planning, the Group of 8 summit meeting opened here on Wednesday without any glaring hitches.\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud that we were able to pull off a miracle,\u201d Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Wednesday evening at a news conference.\n\u201cI thank everyone who agreed to move the venue here,\u201d Mr. Berlusconi said, adding that world leaders said they were \u201chappy\u201d to come to L\u2019Aquila, \u201cthe capital of grief.\u201d\nIt was a rush job. Two weeks after an April 6 earthquake killed nearly 300 people in this central Italian city, Mr. Berlusconi announced that he was moving the meeting here from La Maddalena, an island off the coast of Sardinia. In recent weeks, more than 1,000 workers labored round the clock to transform a school for the Italian Finance Police into a compound holding 1,500 international delegates and more than 3,000 journalists, complete with fresh grass and wicker lawn sets.\nYet Italy is still on the defensive. On the eve of the summit meeting, Mr. Berlusconi, who is fending off a sex scandal, gave a last-minute news conference, largely to dispel news reports that Italy had bungled the logistics and had ceded control of the gathering\u2019s agenda to the United States.\nMr. Berlusconi said that the summit meeting was the product of international teamwork and that the Italian point people had worked \u201celbow to elbow\u201d with their counterparts. He added that the proposed joint declarations had been \u201cnegotiated and all shared by the other leaders.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Mike Froman, a chief economic adviser to President Obama, told reporters in L\u2019Aquila that he thought the Italians had done \u201ca terrific job preparing the summit,\u201d in terms of both facilities and agenda, which the Italians defined \u201cearly on and worked methodically through.\u201d\nMr. Froman denied a report that top aides had an emergency conference call because of concerns before the gathering.\nBeyond the heady agenda, which focuses on the economic crisis, climate change and Middle East politics, Italy hopes that holding the Group of 8 meeting in L\u2019Aquila will help bring international attention and financing to the area, where the quake left 65,000 people homeless and flattened the economy.\nTwo months after the earthquake, tens of thousands of L\u2019Aquila residents are still living in tents. On Wednesday, representatives of local citizens groups lugged gigantic letters to a hilltop that read, \u201cYes we camp.\u201d\n\u201cWe wanted the leaders to see it,\u201d said Stefano Frezza of Epicentro Solidale, a citizens group based in L\u2019Aquila. \u201cWe wanted them to know that while they\u2019re sleeping comfortably, we\u2019re still in tents.\u201d\nAccording to the official Group of 8 Web site, the delegations were being hosted in \u201cfar from luxurious\u201d accommodations on site, in keeping with the decision to hold an \u201caustere\u201d summit meeting, and \u201cas close to the discomfort and inconvenience that the people of Abruzzo are having to put up with,\u201d referring to the region where L\u2019Aquila is located.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Berlusconi showed Mr. Obama around downtown L\u2019Aquila, pausing in the main town square in front of the church of the Anime Sante, whose cupola is cracked open like an Easter egg.\nThe two leaders shook hands with recovery workers, and Mr. Obama told firefighters, \u201cNice job. Keep up the good work,\" according to a pool report. He added: \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with all the family members who lost loved ones.\"\nMr. Obama also shook his head in a modest gesture of disbelief in front of the collapsed facade of the main city government office.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Berlusconi showed the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, around Onna, one of the towns hardest hit by the quake, where houses still lie in ruins. Flanked by advisers in suits and yellow hard hats, the two leaders stopped to thank rescue and recovery workers.\nGermany has pledged to help restore the town, a choice made in part because in 1944 Nazi soldiers killed 17 residents in Onna. Mrs. Merkel said she wanted her visit \u201cto be a positive gesture for a town that in the past was struck by Germany,\u201d the Italian news agency ANSA reported.\n\u201cWe hope that Onna becomes an example of sound building practices in the reconstruction,\u201d said Marzia Masiello, a spokeswoman for the residents of Onna.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09italy.html", "title": "Near Tents and Ruins, G-8 Summit Meeting Opens", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO and ELISABETTA POVOLEDO"}

T-shirts, stickers and pins on sale at the back of the store are emblazoned with slogans like \u201cSupport Your Local Mujahedeen\u201d and \u201cTaliban All-Stars.\u201d\nThe jihadi books at the store, which is called Arofah, have been made available by a small but growing group of publishers in and around Solo, a commercial city known as a bastion of conservative Islam.\nMany of the publishers openly support the ideological goals of Jemaah Islamiyah, a banned Southeast Asia terrorist network that has been implicated in most of the major terrorist bombings in Indonesia.\nThe publishers, about 12 so far, still have limited prospects for sales and influence. Radical books generally do not sell well in Indonesia, where a vast majority of the population of 240 million practice a moderate brand of Islam.\nA book by one of the Bali bombers, whose attacks on nightclubs in 2002 killed 202 people, is considered a success for its genre but sold only about 10,000 copies.\nNevertheless, the publishers have caught the attention of some counterterrorism experts, who fear they are proof of how interconnected, and resilient, the Jemaah Islamiyah movement is in Indonesia.\nBy most accounts, the Indonesian authorities have had great success in weakening Jemaah Islamiyah\u2019s militant arm since the Bali bombings, jailing or killing most of its top leaders. But they have been less successful in fighting the organization\u2019s ideology, which counterterrorism experts say spreads within an informal association of groups operating in mosques, prisons and schools around the country, providing a continuing source of recruitment.\n\u201cThe most interesting aspect is what the publishing operations reveal about the overlapping networks binding Jemaah Islamiyah together,\u201d said Sidney R. Jones, an analyst with the nonprofit International Crisis Group in Jakarta, Indonesia\u2019s capital.\n\u201cThis organization is not some Arab import,\u201d Ms. Jones said of Jemaah Islamiyah. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary social organization linked by family, schools, culture, training and now businesses.\u201d\nShe notes that Solo is not only the base for the publishers, but also the site of Pesantren al-Mukmin, an Islamic boarding school that has educated some of the country\u2019s most notorious extremists. Some of the publishers have taught at the school, and Abu Bakar Bashir, a militant Islamic cleric who helped found the school, originally conceived of the idea of opening publishing houses in Solo that could specialize in books on Islam, Ms. Jones said. Mr. Bashir served time in prison on conspiracy charges in several bombings, including those in Bali.\nThe International Crisis Group, an organization established to prevent or resolve deadly conflicts, says there is a chance that the growth in publishers of radical books could have an upside, possibly indicating that Jemaah Islamiyah is beginning to wage jihad through the printed page rather than violent acts.\n\u201cSome publishers may be playing a more positive than negative role, directing members into above-ground activities and enabling them to promote a jihadi message without engaging in violence,\u201d said a report issued last year by the International Crisis Group.\nBut Indonesian authorities say that the message of jihad, once put into book form, often enters classrooms and Islamic study circles, ultimately helping to draw young people into Jemaah Islamiyah\u2019s ranks. And that could allow the militants to regroup as a potent fighting force.\nMost of the books celebrating radical Islamic thought are Indonesian translations of Middle Eastern works. But the publishers are also picking up the works of some local authors.\nOne was Imam Samudra, who was executed for his role in the terrorist attacks in Bali in 2002.\nThe publishers are also hoping to publish the work of another Bali bomber, Ali Ghufron, better known as Mukhlas, the former operations chief for Jemaah Islamiyah.\nBefore his execution last year, he wrote 10 books, including an autobiography that his lawyer says portrays the Bali bombings as justifiable acts of vengeance for the ill treatment of Muslims around the world.\nSolo\u2019s publishers can afford to print such jihadi books by piggybacking on a broader trend: the ballooning demand in Indonesia for mainstream Islamic texts.\nBooks that explore the Islamic faith \u2014 addressing issues like how to be a good Muslim woman, or Islamic beliefs about life after death \u2014 are the biggest sellers here now. One popular love story with an Islamic theme sold hundreds of thousands of copies and was recently made into a movie.\n\u201cThe mainstream Islamic publishing industry is booming right now,\u201d said Setia Darma Madjid, chairman of the Indonesian Book Publishers Association. \u201cWriters and publishers recognize that these themes appeal to readers right now, and so they are rolling out hundreds of books on the subject.\u201d\nAt least some publishers of radical texts say they, too, are just meeting market demand, not trying to spread an ideology.\nOne such publisher is Bambang Sukirno, who owns the Aqwam Group and its imprint Jazera, which got its start with Imam Samudra\u2019s first book. He said he was only addressing a topical subject, just as \u201cjournalists and others around the world are doing.\u201d\n\u201cWe see that this \u2018terrorism\u2019 phenomenon, whether you like it or not, has seized space in this world,\u201d he said.\nSo far, the government has taken no action against the publishers despite its crackdown on Islamists. Officials are worried about terrorist attacks but are also trying to nurture their young democracy and the freedoms that democracy guarantees.\n\u201cThe publication of such material is an issue; we are not very happy about it,\u201d said one senior counterterrorism official in the government, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. \u201cHowever, because we are in the process of democratization, it is problematic how we would be able to control the publication of such material.\u201d\nMr. Sukirno said he was not worried that the government would shut down his company.\n\u201cDemocracy in Indonesia is thriving, and if the government ever tried to interfere in the publishing industry, well, that would be dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cInterference would just give birth to waves of resistance and undermine democracy.\n\u201cBooks,\u201d he said, \u201care a reflection of a civilized nation.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/world/asia/09indo.html", "title": "Radical Books Raise Fears in Indonesia of Spread of Militants\u2019 Ideas", "author": "PETER GELLING"}

Late last month, the ship turned around and began sailing homeward. On Sunday, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said the ship turned back because the United Nations sanctions prevented it from entering any port.\nThe ship was sailing in international waters between China and the Korean Peninsula on Monday and was likely to enter North Korean waters within the day, said Won Tae-jae, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry.\nNorth Korea has not explained why the ship appeared to have canceled its voyage.\nAmerican authorities monitored the ship but did not stop and search it \u2014 a move the North had said it would interpret as an act of war. But American authorities worked with regional governments to inspect the ship under the United Nations mandate if it entered their ports.\nThe South Korean authorities suspect the Kang Nam 1 is carrying a cargo of rifles and rocket launchers for Myanmar, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Monday, quoting an unidentified government source. If the ship indeed was carrying weapons, aborting its voyage would be seen as a victory for the latest round of sanctions.\nThe Security Council imposed the sanctions after the North tested a nuclear weapon on May 25.\nIn a gesture of defiance, meanwhile, North Korea fired seven ballistic missiles on Saturday during the United States\u2019 Fourth of July holiday. The South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported Monday that the missiles fired on Saturday included three Scud-ER missiles, which have a range of up to 620 miles and can hit Japan.\nThe Defense Ministry here said it could not confirm the report. But South Korean officials have told reporters that the North appeared to have fired five Scuds and two Rodong missiles.\nFive of them plunged into the same zone in the sea between North Korea and Japan, indicating that the North was improving its firing accuracy, they said.\n\u201cSome of it seems like almost attention-seeking behavior,\u201d Mr. Biden told the ABC News program \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, referring to the North\u2019s latest missile tests. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give the attention.\u201d\nThe North Korean cargo ship turned around because the United States has \u201csucceeded in uniting the most important and critical countries to North Korea on a common path of further isolating North Korea,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThere was no place they could go with certitude that they would not be, in fact, at that point boarded and searched.\u201d\nPhilip S. Goldberg, the American diplomat coordinating enforcement of the sanctions, visited Malaysia on Monday for talks with officials there. Unconfirmed news reports in South Korea said that American officials had found bank accounts in Malaysia used by North Korea for its illicit trading and were seeking to shut them down. The Malaysian foreign minister, Anifah Aman, could not confirm the reports but pledged that his government would work with the United States.\n\u201cIf they have evidence, we\u2019ll be most willing to work together to solve this problem,\u201d he said, according to The Associated Press.\nMr. Goldberg was in Beijing last week to discuss sanctions enforcement with officials in China, the North\u2019s largest trade partner and provider of aid.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/world/asia/07korea.html", "title": "South Korea Says Freighter From North Turns Back", "author": "CHOE SANG-HUN"}
{"date": "Sun, 30 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Iraqi officials have discovered that they may have a real air force, after all.\nThe Defense Ministry revealed Sunday that it had recently learned that Iraq owns 19 MIG-21 and MIG-23 jet fighters, which are in storage in Serbia. Ministry officials are negotiating with the Serbs to restore and return the aircraft.\nThe Serbian government has tentatively promised to make two of the aircraft available \u201cfor immediate use,\u201d according to a news release from the ministry. The rest would be restored on a rush basis, the ministry said.\nAn Iraqi delegation went to Serbia as part of an effort by the government to locate assets stashed abroad by Saddam Hussein to evade sanctions. Serbia had had friendly relations with Mr. Hussein\u2019s government.\nDuring that visit, Serbian defense officials told the Iraqis that Mr. Hussein had sent 19 fighter jets to Serbia for repairs in the late 1980s, during the Iran-Iraq war, but was unable to bring them back after sanctions were imposed on his country.\nIraq immediately sent a technical delegation, led by the air force chief, Gen. Anwar Mohammed Amin.\nThe Web site of the Iraqi Supreme Islamic Council, the leading Shiite political party, quoted the Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammed al-Askari as saying that the aircraft had been sent in 1989 \u201cfor maintenance, and everything was paid for by Iraq\u2019s money.\u201d Mr. Askari said the discovery was important because Iraq had no jet aircraft with defensive or offensive capabilities. \u201cOur air force only has helicopters,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEveryone knows how much we need fighter aircraft,\u201d the ministry statement said. \u201cWe have reached a tentative agreement with the Serbian side to rehabilitate the aircraft and deliver them to Iraq in the shortest possible time, in recognition of Iraq\u2019s need for such aircraft.\u201d\nThe Defense Ministry statement was issued as a rebuttal to Iraqi news reports claiming that secret negotiations were under way with Serbia as part of a corrupt arms deal.\nThe rebuttal was at times angry, calling the criticism politically motivated and \u201ca broken record which has become boring and funny.\u201d\nThe American military\u2019s training command has recently arranged for the delivery of Iraq\u2019s first trainer for jet pilots, the propeller-driven T-6, in December. The T-6 is used to train pilots for the F-16 jet, but plans for Iraq to buy F-16s are still in the discussion stage, American officials say.\n\u201cWe are working for the interests of Iraq,\u201d Mr. Askari said about the discovery of the Iraqi MIGs in Serbia.\nLt. Col. Gary Kolb, a spokesman for the Multi-National Transition and Security Command-Iraq, or M.N.T. S.C.-I., the American military\u2019s training wing, said the discovery of the Iraqi-owned MIGs would not alter any American plans, at least not immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while to see what impact it has,\u201d he said.\nSo far, the Iraqi Air Force has only 87 aircraft, mostly transport and reconnaissance planes and helicopters, and only one ground attack aircraft. It has no jets.\nMr. Hussein\u2019s government, which in 1990 had the world\u2019s sixth largest air force with 750 aircraft, lost many MIGs and French Mirages when the United States bombed them during the first Persian Gulf war; nearly 100 were flown to Iran to escape destruction, even though Iran was then an enemy of Iraq. Iran has still not returned the aircraft, despite otherwise warm relations between the two countries now, saying they were war reparations for the Iran-Iraq war.\nThe Serbian discovery would potentially give Iraq a jet fighter capability long before it could develop one with American aircraft.\nAmerican officials cautioned, however, that acquiring the MIGs would just be the beginning of a long process. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just getting aircraft; there\u2019s maintenance and support structures, training. It\u2019s not going to change what M.N.T.S.C. -I. does,\u201d Colonel Kolb said.\nIraqi officials have been hunting for missing financial and military assets in a number of countries where Mr. Hussein did business, including Egypt, Russia, France and Italy.\nThey have found two naval vessels belonging to Iraq in Egypt and two others in Italy, and other mat\u00e9riel in France and Russia, Mr. Askari, the Defense Ministry spokesman, said in a telephone interview.\nIn Belgrade, the B-92 independent news channel quoted officials as saying that Serbia had reached an arms export deal with Iraq that would result in employment for 6,000 workers in six military factories. Last year, the country exported $235 million worth of arms to Iraq.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/world/middleeast/31iraq.html", "title": "Remnants of Iraq Air Force Are Found", "author": "ROD NORDLAND"}

{"date": "Tue, 10 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The confrontation between a United States naval vessel and five Chinese ships is the \u201cmost serious\u201d military dispute between the countries since a midair collision in 2001 forced an American surveillance plane to land on Hainan island, the director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, said Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nEarlier in the day, China lashed out at the United States over the Sunday confrontation, blaming the Navy ship, the Impeccable, for what it called a violation of international law by conducting surveillance activities in waters where China claims jurisdiction. It disputed the American view that it was the Chinese vessels that had acted aggressively.\nMa Zhaoxu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a briefing in Beijing, \u201cThe U.S. claims are gravely in contravention of the facts and confuse black and white, and they are totally unacceptable to China.\u201d\nHe did not specify what laws that China contended the American ship had broken, but said the Impeccable had \u201cconducted activities in China\u2019s special economic zone in the South China Sea without China\u2019s permission.\u201d\nBut the United States and other nations consider the area international waters. On Monday, the United States lodged a formal complaint with the Beijing government over the episode.\nMr. Blair said at the Senate hearing that the Chinese \u201cseem to be more militarily aggressive\" in general.\nAccording to a Pentagon statement and Pentagon officials, the confrontation started when the Chinese vessels surrounded and harassed the Impeccable, about 75 miles off Hainan island, south of the Chinese mainland. At least one came within 25 feet of the American boat, and Chinese sailors used hooks to try to snag cables the Navy boat was using to tow sonar equipment designed for antisubmarine warfare.\nChina has invested heavily in a new fleet of diesel-powered attack submarines and maintains a submarine base on Hainan. The waters where the confrontation took place would probably be plied by Chinese submarines.\nAccording to the American account, as the Chinese vessels approached the American ship, Chinese sailors waved flags and ordered it to leave. The Impeccable, which did not carry large-caliber weapons and was operated by civilian contractors for the Military Sealift Command, told the Chinese vessels that it had the right of safe passage in international waters. But two of the Chinese ships blocked the Impeccable after it requested safe transit, while Chinese sailors dropped pieces of wood in its path and wielded hooks.\nDuring the confrontation, the Impeccable\u2019s crew sprayed some of the Chinese sailors with a fire hose, causing some of the sailors to strip to their underwear. The Chinese ships consisted of a naval intelligence vessel, two smaller trawlers, a fisheries patrol boat and an official oceanographic ship, Pentagon officials said.\nIn Hawaii, at the headquarters for the United States Pacific Command, Capt. Jeffrey A. Breslau, a spokesman, said Tuesday: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what the Chinese intentions were. There have been a few incidents over the past week and a half. But who orchestrated this latest one, and why, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\nCaptain Breslau said that while the Chinese maneuvers had been dangerous, a hot line linking Adm. Timothy J. Keating, the leader of the Pacific Command, with his counterpart in Beijing had not been used.\nThe encounter, less than two months after President Obama\u2019s inauguration, immediately drew comparisons to an episode that confronted President George W. Bush with his first foreign-policy challenge shortly into his first term.\nIn April 2001, a Chinese fighter jet buzzed a Navy surveillance airplane in international airspace over the South China Sea, causing a midair collision that killed the Chinese pilot and resulted in the detention of the 24 American crew members for 11 days after their plane made an emergency landing on Hainan.\nMr. Obama will have a chance to discuss Sunday\u2019s confrontation with his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, when the two meet next month in London at a Group of 20 session of global economic powers.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/asia/11military.html", "title": "China and U.S. Clash on Naval Fracas", "author": "THOM SHANKER and MARK MAZZETTI"}
{"date": "Sun, 15 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KIEV, Ukraine \u2014 A quarter century ago, a Ukrainian historian named Stanislav Kulchytsky was told by his Soviet overlords to concoct an insidious cover-up. His orders: to depict the famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the early 1930s as unavoidable, like a natural disaster. Absolve the Communist Party of blame. Uphold the legacy of Stalin.\nProfessor Kulchytsky, though, would not go along.\nThe other day, as he stood before a new memorial to the victims of the famine, he recalled his decision as one turning point in a movement lasting decades to unearth the truth about that period. And the memorial itself, shaped like a towering candle with a golden eternal flame, seemed to him in some sense a culmination of this effort.\n\u201cIt is a sign of our respect for the past,\u201d Professor Kulchytsky said. \u201cBecause everyone was silent about the famine for many years. And when it became possible to talk about it, nothing was said. Three generations on.\u201d\nThe concrete memorial was dedicated last November, the 75th anniversary of the famine, in a park in Kiev, on a hillside overlooking the Dnieper River in the shadow of the onion domes of a revered Orthodox Christian monastery. More than 100 feet tall, the memorial will eventually house a small museum that will offer testimony from survivors, as well as information about the Ukrainian villages that suffered.\nIn the Soviet Union, the authorities all but banned discussion of the famine, but by the 1980s the United States and other countries were pressing their own inquiries, often at the urging of Ukrainian immigrants.\nIn response, Communist officials embarked on a propaganda drive to play down the famine and show that the deaths were caused by unforeseen food shortages or drought. Professor Kulchytsky said he had been given the task of gathering research but concluded that the famine had been man-made.\n\u201cI became convinced that everything was not as I once thought,\u201d he said.\nHe refused to falsify his findings and instead released them publicly, escaping punishment only because glasnost had begun under the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.\nThe famine is known in Ukrainian as the Holodomor \u2014 literally, death or killing by starvation \u2014 and the campaign to give it recognition has played a significant role in the Ukrainian quest to shape a national identity in the post-Soviet era. It has also further strained relations with the Kremlin, another of the festering disputes left by the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nThe pro-Western government in Kiev, which came to power after the Orange Revolution of 2004, calls the famine a genocide that Stalin ordered because he wanted to decimate the Ukrainian citizenry and snuff out aspirations for independence from Moscow.\nThe archives make plain that no other conclusion is possible, said Professor Kulchytsky, who is deputy director of the Institute of Ukrainian History in Kiev.\nProfessor Kulchytsky is 72, though he looks younger, as if he has somehow withstood the draining effect of so much research into the horrors of that time.\n\u201cIt is difficult to bear,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cThe documents about cannibalism are especially difficult to read.\u201d\nProfessor Kulchytsky said it was undeniable that people all over the Soviet Union died from hunger in 1932 and 1933 as the Communists waged war on the peasantry to create farming collectives. But he contended that in Ukraine the authorities went much further, essentially quarantining and starving many villages.\n\u201cIf in other regions, people were hungry and died from famine, then here people were killed by hunger,\u201d Professor Kulchytsky said. \u201cThat is the absolute difference.\u201d\nIn recent years, Ukraine\u2019s president, Viktor A. Yushchenko, has regularly spoken out about the famine, and has even sought to make denying it a crime. Ukraine has asked other countries to recognize the famine as genocide and to establish memorials. One is being built in Washington.\nIn Kiev, the memorial has started to become a pilgrimage site.\n\u201cOf course, it is needed,\u201d said Hrigory Mikhailenko, 75, a construction executive from central Ukraine who stopped by during a business trip. \u201cSo many people died. Four members of my family. It\u2019s very important to note what happened. That is why Russia is pressuring us.\u201d\nRussia has spurned the memorial. Instead of attending its dedication, Russia\u2019s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, sent a letter to Mr. Yushchenko accusing him of using the famine to discredit Russia.\n\u201cWe do not condone the repression carried out by the Stalinist regime against the entire Soviet people,\u201d Mr. Medvedev wrote. \u201cBut to say that it was aimed at the destruction of Ukrainians means going against the facts and trying to give a nationalist subtext to a common tragedy.\u201d\nLast month, Russian historians and archivists sought to bolster the Kremlin\u2019s case, issuing a DVD and a book of historical documents that they said demonstrated that the famine was not directed at Ukraine. Many of the documents were translated into English, underscoring how the two countries are waging their fight on an international stage.\nProfessor Kulchytsky said the Kremlin feared that if it conceded the truth, Russia, considered the successor to the Soviet Union, could face claims for reparations. Still, he said he would not ignore misstatements by the Ukrainian side, either.\nFor example, President Yushchenko has said that as many as 10 million Ukrainians died, while Professor Kulchytsky believes that the figure is 3.5 million.\nNor is the professor enamored with the design of the memorial, saying that he would have preferred some of the other proposals. But he said there was no doubt that the country had to be reminded of its history.\n\u201cI know many people, including famous people \u2014 smart, intellectual people \u2014 whose relatives, grandparents, died in the famine, and they speak out harshly against focusing on Holodomor,\u201d Professor Kulchytsky said. \u201cThey consider it not a part of the present. But how can we be quiet about what occurred? Our people were the victims of a great crime.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/world/europe/16kiev.html", "title": "A New View of a Famine That Killed Millions", "author": "CLIFFORD J.

One witness said the bombs had struck a market, killing at least 35 people who appeared to be civilians.\nHours later, the rebels posted an Internet statement saying 70 civilians had been killed and 100 wounded, after fighter jets struck the town more than 50 times. The town is \u201ctens of kilometers\u201d from the war zone where rebels have been fighting the Saudi military, the rebel statement said.\nThe rebels, known as Houthis after the clan of their leader, said the airstrikes were carried out by Saudi warplanes. Saudi military officials could not be reached on Sunday night, and Yemeni officials declined to comment.\nThe Houthis have fought an intermittent war with the Yemeni government for more than five years. The conflict intensified in August, when the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, declared that he meant to finish off the rebellion once and for all.\nThe Saudis became involved early last month, when Houthi fighters seized a strategic hilltop on the Saudi border and killed a Saudi border guard. The rebels said the Saudis had forced their hand by allowing the Yemeni military to use the hill to attack them.\nThe Saudis, with a vastly superior military force, pushed the rebels from the border using airstrikes and mortar fire. But the Houthis continued their attacks, and succeeded in capturing a number of Saudi soldiers.\nIf the airstrikes in Razah were in fact carried out by Saudi forces, the attack could amplify anger against the Saudis among Yemeni tribes. That could intensify the challenges the Saudis face in a volatile area that is flooded with weapons, where Yemen\u2019s own efforts to assert control through military force have often backfired.\nThe Saudi role has already threatened to extend a conflict with troubling sectarian overtones. The Houthis belong to the Zaydi sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. They have long complained that the Yemeni government, with encouragement from the Saudis, fostered hard-line Sunni militants in the Zaydi heartland of Saada Province.\nThe Yemeni government has long accused Iran of supporting the Houthis, despite the fact that Zaydism is doctrinally distinct from the Shiism practiced in Iran. Iran has denied aiding the rebels, but Iranian state news media have reported on the Houthis sympathetically.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/world/middleeast/14yemen.html", "title": "Airstrikes Kill at Least 35 in Northwestern Yemen", "author": "ROBERT F.

Kalaallisut, a traditional Inuit dialect, is now the country\u2019s official language, and Greenlanders are now recognized under international law as a separate people from Danes.\nThrillingly, the Greenlandic government now gets to call itself by its Inuit name, Naalakkersuisut \u2014 the first time in history, officials said, that the word has been used in a Danish government document.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new relationship based on equality,\u201d said Greenland\u2019s new, charismatic prime minister, Kuupik Kleist, speaking of the balance of power between Greenland and Denmark.\nHe compared the situation to a marriage in which the wife was bossing around her henpecked husband. \u201cFrom today,\u201d he said, \u201cthe man in the house has as much say as the wife.\u201d\nBut this is a delicate time, full of hope and trepidation in equal measure. Few Greenlanders graduate from college. The country is rife with social problems like alcoholism, unemployment and domestic violence. Infrastructure improvements are punishingly expensive and desperately needed in a place where, for instance, people travel by boat or plane because there are no roads connecting towns.\nMeanwhile, global warming is rapidly melting the mighty icecap that covers some 80 percent of Greenland\u2019s 840,000 square miles. Although that is destroying traditional hunting livelihoods, it also brings new opportunities for exploring and exploiting what could be vast reserves of oil and minerals deep beneath Greenland\u2019s surface and in the waters around it.\nUnder the new self-government agreement, Greenland will get half of any proceeds from oil or minerals. The other half will go to Denmark, to be deducted from the grant of 3.4 billion kroner, or $637 million, that it gives Greenland each year. The hope is that eventually the subsidy can cease altogether and Greenland will be ready for independence.\nThe prospect of Greenland\u2019s benefiting from what may be a lucrative oil and mineral business raises an obvious question: What\u2019s in it for Denmark?\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question about money,\u201d the Danish prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, said in an interview here. \u201cThis is a question of respecting Greenlandic people and giving them the right to decide their own destiny.\u201d\nThe right to self-determination, particularly for indigenous people like Greenland\u2019s Inuit, more commonly known as Eskimos, was a recurring theme this weekend. Two exotically dressed visitors from Norway\u2019s Sami Parliament, which represents the country\u2019s reindeer herders, appeared at a trade exposition here on Saturday, marveling at how far the Greenlanders had come.\n\u201cThey\u2019re many steps farther along than we are,\u201d said Marianne Balto, Parliament\u2019s vice president. \u201cIt gives hope to the Sami people.\u201d\nIceland\u2019s president, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, was there, looking at it from the other side, recalling how his country ended hundreds of years of Danish rule with independence in 1944.\nBent Liisberg, a lawyer from Norway, which was owned for hundreds of years by Denmark and then by Sweden, had much the same perspective. On Sunday, he was carrying a backpack from which protruded a little Greenlandic flag, its red-and-white design representing the sea, sky and sun. \u201cThis is a great day for small nations,\u201d he said.\nNuuk is a curious city, where old, brightly colored wooden houses built by the original Danish settlers coexist with rows of down-on-their-heels apartment buildings that are almost Soviet in their soullessness. Its harbor is impossibly quaint and its views breathtakingly beautiful; its center is indifferently maintained and virtually paralyzed by traffic at 8 o\u2019clock every morning, when the workday begins.\nIt has 15,000 residents, and many seemed to be out and about at 7:30 a.m., when the procession down to the harbor for the self-government celebrations began. It snowed the day before \u2014 giving a strange feeling at a time of year when there is virtually no darkness \u2014 but on Sunday the sun blazed across the water.\nRepresentatives from 17 countries and territories, including the United States and the Faroe Islands (also owned by Denmark), were there. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, wearing a traditional Inuit costume with shorts made of seal fur and a short, beaded shawl, solemnly handed over the official self-government document to the chairman of Greenland\u2019s Parliament.\nFor Greenlanders, who can feel like second-class citizens in Denmark, the new arrangement bolsters a national pride they almost didn\u2019t know they had.\n\u201cIt is nothing that we will feel on a day-to-day basis, but the symbolic value of this gives people so much more confidence,\u201d said Peter Lovstrom, 28, who works at the national art museum in Nuuk.\nHe said it was impossible to feel rancor toward Denmark, given all of the intermarriage and connections between the countries.\n\u201cWe all get along. We have to get along,\u201d Mr. Lovstrom said. \u201cBut I feel a bit more Greenlandic now.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/world/europe/22greenland.html", "title": "Fondly, Greenland Loosens Danish Rule", "author": "SARAH LYALL"}
{"date": "Sat, 10 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In late 2001, Mullah Muhammad Omar\u2019s prospects seemed utterly bleak. The ill-educated, one-eyed leader of the Taliban had fled on a motorbike after his fighters were swiftly routed by the Americans invading Afghanistan.\nMuch of the world celebrated his ouster, and Afghans cheered the return of girls\u2019 education, music and ordinary pleasures outlawed by the grim fundamentalist government.\nEight years later, Mullah Omar leads an insurgency that has gained steady ground in much of Afghanistan against much better equipped American and NATO forces. Far from a historical footnote, he represents a vexing security challenge for the Obama administration, one that has consumed the president\u2019s advisers, divided Democrats and left many Americans frustrated.\n\u201cThis is an amazing story,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who coordinated the Obama administration\u2019s initial review of Afghanistan policy in the spring. \u201cHe\u2019s a semiliterate individual who has met with no more than a handful of non-Muslims in his entire life. And he\u2019s staged one of the most remarkable military comebacks in modern history.\u201d\nAmerican officials are weighing the significance of this comeback: Is Mullah Omar the brains behind shrewd shifts of Taliban tactics and propaganda in recent years, or does he have help from Pakistani intelligence? Might the Taliban be amenable to negotiations, as Mullah Omar hinted in a Sept. 19 statement, or can his network be divided and weakened in some other way? Or is the Taliban\u2019s total defeat required to ensure that Afghanistan will never again become a haven for Al Qaeda?\nThe man at the center of the American policy conundrum remains a mystery, the subject of adoring mythmaking by his followers and guesswork by the world\u2019s intelligence agencies. He was born, by various accounts, in 1950 or 1959 or 1960 or 1962. He may be hiding near Quetta, Pakistan, or hunkered down in an Afghan village. No one is sure.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t operate openly; there are too many people looking for him,\u201d and the eye he lost to Soviet shrapnel in the 1980s makes him recognizable, said Alex Strick van Linschoten, a Dutch-born writer who lives in Kandahar, where Mullah Omar\u2019s movement was born, and who has helped a former Taliban official write a memoir.\n\u201cThere are four or five people who can pass messages to Omar,\u201d Mr. Strick van Linschoten said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s a circle of people who can get access to those four or five people.\u201d\nRahimullah Yusufzai, of The News International, a Pakistani newspaper, who interviewed Mullah Omar a dozen times before 2001, called him \u201ca man of few words and not very knowledgeable about international affairs.\u201d But his reputed humility, his legend as a ferocious fighter against Soviet invaders in the 1980s, and his success in ending the lawlessness and bloody warlords\u2019 feuds of the early 1990s cemented his power.\n\u201cHis followers adore him, believe in him and are willing to die for him,\u201d Mr. Yusufzai said. While even Taliban officials rarely see him, Mullah Omar \u201cremains an inspiration, sending out letters and audiotapes to his commanders and fighters,\u201d the journalist said.\nA recent assessment by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top American commander in Afghanistan, identified the Taliban as the most important part of the insurgency, coordinating \u201cloosely\u201d with groups led by two prominent warlords. He concluded that \u201cthe insurgents currently have the initiative\u201d and \u201cthe overall situation is deteriorating.\u201d\nThe statement from Mullah Omar, one of a series issued in his name on each of the two annual Id holidays, offered a remarkably similar analysis. He, or his ghostwriter, praised the success of \u201cthe gallant mujahedeen\u201d in countering the \u201csophisticated and cutting-edge technology\u201d of the enemy, saying the Taliban movement \u201cis approaching the edge of victory.\u201d\nFor a recluse, he showed a keen awareness of Western public opinion, touching on the history that haunts foreign armies in Afghanistan (\u201cWe fought against the British invaders for 80 years\u201d), denouncing fraud in the recent presidential election and asking of the American-led forces, \u201cHave they achieved anything in the past eight years?\u201d\nAmerican military and intelligence analysts say the Taliban have definitely achieved some things. They describe today\u2019s Afghan Taliban as a franchise operation, a decentralized network of fighters with varying motivations, united by hostility to the Afghan government and foreign forces and by loyalty to Mullah Omar.\nThe Taliban have deployed fighters in small guerrilla units and stepped up the use of suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices. The movement has expanded military operations from the Taliban\u2019s southern stronghold into the north and west of the country, forcing NATO to spread its troops more thinly.\nDay-to-day decisions are made by Mullah Omar\u2019s deputies, in particular Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a skilled, pragmatic commander, who runs many meetings with Taliban commanders and \u201cshadow governors\u201d appointed in much of the country, analysts say.\nMullah Omar heads the Taliban\u2019s Rahbari Shura, or leadership council, often called the Quetta Shura since it relocated to the Pakistani city in 2002. The shura, consisting of the Taliban commanders, \u201coperates like the politburo of a communist party,\u201d setting broad strategy, said Mr. Yusufzai, the Pakistani journalist. General McChrystal wrote in his assessment that the shura \u201cconducts a formal campaign review each winter, after which Mullah Omar announces his guidance and intent for the coming year.\u201d\nThomas E. Gouttierre, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, said that \u201cas a symbolic figure, Omar is a centrifugal force for the Taliban,\u201d playing a similar role to that of Osama bin Laden in Al Qaeda. But Dr. Gouttierre credits the Taliban\u2019s success not to any military genius on the part of Mullah Omar but to more worldly advisers from Pakistan\u2019s intelligence service and Al Qaeda.\nWestern and Afghan sources agree on the bare outline of Mullah Omar\u2019s biography: He was born in a village, had limited religious schooling, fought with the mujahedeen against the Soviet Army and helped form the Taliban in 1994. Some accounts say he is married and has two sons.\nHis emergence as the leader of the puritanical students who later fought their way to the capital, Kabul, may have resulted from his very obscurity, some experts say. He was not a flamboyant warlord with allies and enemies, a likely plus for the Taliban\u2019s sponsors in Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate. \u201cHe had an unaligned quality that made him useful,\u201d Mr. Strick van Linschoten said.\nIn jihadist accounts, his story has the feeling of legend: \u201cAt the height of his youth, he stepped forward against the disbelievers and terrorized their ranks,\u201d says an undated 10-page biography from an Islamist information agency, which also describes how he once refused cream and other delicacies, preferring \u201ca bowl of plain soup with some hard, stale bread.\u201d\nTaliban folklore tells of his bravery in the 1980s in removing his own injured eye and fighting on; of his dream in the mid-1990s in which the Prophet Muhammad told him he would bring peace to Afghanistan; and of how in 1996, he donned a cloak reputed to have belonged to the prophet and took the title \u201ccommander of the faithful.\u201d\nThat was the year that Mr. bin Laden moved his base to Afghanistan. Ever since, the central question about Mullah Omar for American officials has been his relationship with Al Qaeda.\nIn 1998, two days after American cruise missiles hit a Qaeda training camp in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Mr. bin Laden, Mullah Omar telephoned an astonished State Department official, Michael E. Malinowski, who took the call on his porch at 2:30 a.m. Mullah Omar demanded proof that the Qaeda leader was involved in terrorism, according to declassified records. (Mullah Omar also suggested that to improve American relations with Muslim countries, President Bill Clinton should step down.)\nMr. bin Laden courted the Taliban leader, vowing allegiance and calling the far less educated man a historic leader of Islam. A letter of advice from Mr. bin Laden to Mullah Omar on Oct. 3, 2001, found on a Qaeda computer obtained by The Wall Street Journal, heaped on the praise (\u201cI would like to emphasize how much we appreciate the fact that you are our emir\u201d).\nDespite intense pressure from the United States and its allies to turn over Mr. bin Laden, Mullah Omar declined, and paid a steep price when the Taliban fell.\nRichard Barrett, a former British intelligence officer now monitoring Al Qaeda and the Taliban for the United Nations, argues that Mullah Omar has learned the lesson of 2001. If the Taliban regain power, he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t want Al Qaeda hanging around.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThey want to be able to say, \u2018We are a responsible government.\u2019 \u201d\nIndeed, in his Sept. 19 statement, Mullah Omar made such an assertion: \u201cWe assure all countries that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as a responsible force, will not extend its hand to cause jeopardy to others.\u201d\nMr. Riedel, who helped devise the Afghanistan strategy now being rethought, scoffs at such pronouncements as \u201cclever propaganda.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for 13 years to get the Taliban to break with Al Qaeda and turn over bin Laden, and they haven\u2019t done it,\u201d Mr. Riedel said. \u201cWhatever the bond is between them, it\u2019s stood the test of time.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/world/asia/11mullah.html", "title": "A Dogged Taliban Chief Rebounds, Vexing U.S.", "author": "SCOTT SHANE"}
{"date": "Wed, 02 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As President Obama prepares to decide whether to send additional troops to Afghanistan, the political climate appears increasingly challenging for him, leaving him in the awkward position of relying on the Republican Party, and not his own, for support.\nThe simple political narrative of the Afghanistan war \u2014 that this was the good war, in which the United States would hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 has faded over time, with popular support ebbing, American casualties rising and confidence in the Afghan government declining. In addition, Afghanistan\u2019s disputed election, and the attendant fraud charges that have been lodged against President Hamid Karzai, are contributing further to the erosion of public support.\nA CBS News poll released on Tuesday reports that 41 percent of those polled wanted troop levels in Afghanistan decreased, compared with 33 percent in April. Far fewer people \u2014 25 percent \u2014 wanted troop levels increased, compared with 39 percent in April. And Mr. Obama\u2019s approval rating for his handling of Afghanistan has dropped eight points since April, to 48 percent.\nCongressional Democrats, particularly those on the left, report increasing disenchantment among constituents with the idea of a long and possibly escalating conflict in Afghanistan, especially as the American strategy comes to resemble a long-term nation-building approach rather than a counterterrorism operation.\n\u201cI and the American people cannot tolerate more troops without some commitment about when this perceived occupation will end,\u201d Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said Wednesday in an interview. He said he had been to 60 town hall meetings in his state so far this year. During the first half of the year, he said, there were no comments about Afghanistan or Iraq. But in the past two months, that has changed, with more people focused on troop losses in Afghanistan.\nAndrew J. Bacevich, a professor of international relations and history at Boston University, said, \u201cThere was a time, back in 2003 and 2004, when it was possible to drum up popular support for the war by attaching to the argument claims that the United States of America was eliminating evil and advancing democracy and women\u2019s rights.\n\u201cBut this is many years later, with the economy in shambles, 5,000 American soldiers dead in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those notions are no longer as compelling as they might have been. War exhaustion sets in,\u201d said Professor Bacevich, author of \u201cThe Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism.\u201d\nEven one strain of conservative thinking has turned negative on the war. The syndicated columnist George F. Will wrote in a column published Tuesday that the United States should substantially reduce its presence in Afghanistan.\nBut despite Mr. Will\u2019s argument, national security hawks in the Republican Party \u2014 not Mr. Obama\u2019s most natural support base \u2014 still back the president on Afghanistan.\n\u201cSo far, to their credit, they\u2019ve either remained silent or they\u2019ve been supportive, guys like McCain and Graham,\u201d said Matt Bennett, vice president of Third Way, a moderately left-wing think tank, referring to Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans.\nAt the moment, Mr. Obama appears to still have the support of Democratic leaders in the Senate and the House, including Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California. Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, indicated on Wednesday that he was not ready to jump ship. But he was not sounding a ringing endorsement, either.\n\u201cI was O.K. with the president\u2019s efforts and goals in Afghanistan,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019m open to hearing whether those are achievable, and as we debate that, we also need to think about what are the costs of reversing course.\u201d\nBut it was the Republican National Committee, and not the Democrats, that was sounding more solidly behind the president on Afghanistan. After Mr. Will\u2019s abdication on Tuesday, the Republican National Committee quickly sent out an e-mail message and posted a statement, \u201cStand Strong, Mr. President,\u201d on its Web site to take issue with the conservative columnist.\n\u201cWe agree with President Obama that \u2018we have to win\u2019 in Afghanistan and make sure that our commanders on the ground have the troops and resources they need,\u201d the committee chairman, Michael Steele, said in the statement. He urged Mr. Obama to \u201cstand strong and speak out for why we are fighting there,\u201d adding that Mr. Obama has said too little so far \u201cabout why the voices of defeat are wrong.\u201d\nSimilarly, Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, said he would continue to back Mr. Obama \u201cas long as we\u2019re making progress.\u201d\nSenator Graham, for his part, was in Afghanistan last week, putting in a stint as Colonel Graham as he served out his Air Force Reserves duty rotation. He met with military officials and soldiers, and talked to Obama administration officials in Kabul, the capital, as well, and is supporting Mr. Obama\u2019s Afghanistan strategy.\nAfghanistan, Mr. Graham said Tuesday in an interview, \u201cis where 9/11 was planned and executed.\n\u201cThis is not Vietnam.\u201d\nHe said he would support a push for more troops in Afghanistan, but added that Mr. Obama would have to make a public case for it to convince wavering people on both the right and the left.\n\u201cThe president needs to be more aggressive about taking ownership of this strategy, and reinforcing to this country the consequences of Afghanistan being lost and becoming a safe haven for Al Qaeda,\u201d Mr. Graham said.\nThe debate over Afghanistan will play out in the coming weeks, as the military decides whether to ask for more troops; commanders in Afghanistan have already said their forces are insufficient to get the job done. Mr. Obama himself must decide whether to make a more public push for a deeper United States commitment. Administration officials say privately that they believe that they have 12 months to show significant progress in Afghanistan before they totally lose public support.\nOne danger for Mr. Obama is that he may be forced to abandon his own party on Afghanistan for the right, which could put him in a perilous position if Republicans at any point decide they do not want to support a Democratic president on the issue.\n\u201cSome people on the right think Afghanistan is hopeless, some people think this is Obama\u2019s war and want to do to Obama the same thing the left did to Bush with Iraq,\u201d Mr. Graham said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/world/asia/03policy.html", "title": "G.O.P.

Others complained that after years in power, Mr. Berlusconi had done little to better the country.\n\u201cThis started with civil society, people who are touched by problems like unemployment and the economy and the environment and want things to change,\u201d said Elisa Tottone, a teacher who lives in Rome. \u201cBerlusconi is not dealing with Italy\u2019s real problems. He only cares about his own.\u201d\nThe demonstration appeared to be larger than one in October called to defend press freedom and widely seen as a thinly veiled attack on the prime minister, who owns the country\u2019s largest private broadcaster and several major magazines. Although protest organizers claimed to have attracted a million marchers on Saturday, the police put the figure much lower, at 90,000.\nWhile the protests have tapped into some discontent, Mr. Berlusconi remains firmly in control despite tensions in his center-right coalition. He faced some popular disapproval this summer after a series of embarrassing sex scandals involving young women who said they were paid to attend his lavish parties. The prime minister has denied any impropriety. And he recently lost his immunity from prosecution, allowing the start of a trial in which he is accused of paying a bribe to a lawyer for false testimony in other corruption cases.\nBut Mr. Berlusconi has also won points among many Italians for solving problems with uncollected trash in Naples and for his handling of the earthquake in L\u2019Aquila in April.\nSome protesters on Saturday said they were also frustrated with the fractured opposition. \u201cI\u2019m disoriented because there is no opposition,\u201d said Marina Garofoli, a retired art historian, adding that the center-left was missing out on an \u201cimportant moment\u201d to capitalize on the country\u2019s discontent.\nOne analyst, Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, a University of Florence political science professor, said he did not believe protests were the way to topple the prime minister. \u201cThe way to do it is to create a credible alternative to him,\u201d he said. \u201dYou can\u2019t just oppose, you have to build a coalition.\u201d\nOn Friday, a convicted killer and Mafia turncoat told a Turin court that he had heard that the Sicilian Cosa Nostra had links with Mr. Berlusconi in the early 1990s. On Saturday, Mr. Berlusconi indirectly addressed the allegations, but he hailed the arrest in Palermo of Giovanni Nicchi, believed to be the new No. 2 member of the Mafia in western Sicily, saying such operations were \u201cthe best response to the calumnies lobbed at the government.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/europe/06italy.html", "title": "Protesters in Rome Denounce Berlusconi", "author": "ELISABETTA POVOLEDO"}

The document was released two days after his arrest.\nCiting the Beijing Public Security Bureau, the official Xinhua news agency said that Mr. Liu, 53, had been formally arrested on Tuesday for \u201calleged agitation activities aimed at subversion of government and overthrowing of the socialist system.\u201d It was not immediately clear if Mr. Liu had been formally indicted as well.\nHuman rights activists are commonly accused of seeking to subvert the state but it is unusual for the government to include an allegation that someone is seeking to overthrow the socialist system as well.\nThe decision to formally arrest Mr. Liu is the latest sign that China is becoming less willing to tolerate dissent, human rights specialists said. More than a dozen human rights lawyers were banned from practicing law earlier this month for representing clients against the government.\n\u201cWhen you jail the most prominent intellectual dissident of the country, whose writing activities had effectively been tolerated for many years, it sends an unambiguous signal of political hardening,\u201d said Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. Mr. Liu\u2019s case has become a public relations dilemma for Beijing officials because of his international prominence.\nXinhua said that Mr. Liu had confessed to police during a preliminary investigation. Prisoners in detention have few legal rights and are subject to pressure.\nChina Human Rights Defenders, a human rights advocacy group, said in a statement that it had learned from Mr. Liu\u2019s wife, Liu Xia, that Mr. Liu had arranged in advance for Mo Shaoping, one of China\u2019s best-known human rights lawyers, to defend him. But Mrs. Liu was told that Mr. Mo would not be allowed to defend Mr. Liu because he had also signed Charter 08, the group said.\nAnother prominent lawyer, Shang Baojun, has not been barred from representing him and so might be allowed to do so, the group added.\nCharter 08 initially had 303 signatories and now has more than 8,000. Some Western experts have suggested that Mr. Liu played a role in drafting the document, but that has not been confirmed and he was reportedly under police surveillance long before his detention in December.\nCharter 08 specifically calls for the abolition of the crime of \u201cincitement of subversion of state power\u201d, the offense for which Mr. Liu appears to have been arrested, although Xinhua did not cite the specific section of China\u2019s criminal code that was invoked for the arrest.\nProminent human rights activists like Mr. Liu are generally not prosecuted unless top levels of the government have already decided that a conviction will be handed down by the courts.\nMr. Liu spent three years undergoing \u201ceducation through labor\u201d in the mid-1990s, after calling for new policies toward Taiwan. But that is an administrative procedure in China and distinct from the kind of criminal case that Mr. Liu now faces. Subversion is punishable in China by up to 15 years in prison.\nMr. Liu\u2019s activism in the months leading up to the Tiananmen Square military crackdown in 1989 was followed by 19 months in prison, although he was never convicted and sentenced then.\nLiu Xia has only been allowed to see her husband twice during his current detention, on Jan. 1 and March 20, China Human Rights Defenders said.\nAmnesty International strongly criticized the decision to prosecute Mr. Liu.\n\u201cThis use of state security charges to punish activists for merely expressing their views must stop,\u201d said Roseann Rife, the group\u2019s deputy program director for Asia and the Pacific. \u201cThis is another act of desperation by a regime that is terrified of public opinion.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/world/asia/25liu.html", "title": "Chinese Dissident Charged With Subversion", "author": "KEITH BRADSHER"}
{"date": "Wed, 11 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PASSAU, Germany \u2014 The stabbing of the police chief here in December provoked a nationwide furor because the victim, Alois Mannichl, was known as a staunch opponent of neo-Nazis, who were immediately blamed for the attack.\nBut the loud public protests and demonstrations in the streets of Passau gave way to silence, as days stretched into weeks and the case remained unsolved. Speculation that the perpetrator was a member of the police chief\u2019s family ran rampant, from local gossip all the way up to the leading newspapers and magazines in Germany.\nWhat had become an instant symbol of out-of-control right-wing violence quickly turned into an investigation under the microscope. Here in this ancient city, which traces its history back to Roman times and earlier, the case and its aftermath have dredged up a reputation for ties to Nazism that civic leaders had worked hard to shed.\nNow two months after the crime shook the country, the police and prosecutors here said Wednesday in a statement that they were more or less back to square one, ruling out Mr. Mannichl\u2019s wife and children while still searching for a man who is 6-foot-3, powerfully built, with close-cropped hair and possibly a tattoo on his neck, the same description released Dec. 14, the day after the attack.\n\u201cAt this point, there is no evidence that the crime was committed by anyone in the family circle,\u201d said the statement. The 50-member special investigative commission established in the days after the attack is investigating \u201cin all directions,\u201d but has no \u201chot lead\u201d at this stage, the statement said.\nThe attack on Mr. Mannichl, which was serious but not fatal, renewed calls nationwide for a ban against the far-right National Democratic Party, known by its German initials as the N.P.D. It also further inflamed concerns about a rise in violence by the extreme right.\nIn the state of Bavaria, where Passau is located, the number of right-wing-motivated assaults rose to 76 in 2007 from 42 in 2006, the most recent government figures available. But the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau has reported unreleased figures that through the first 10 months of 2008, right-wing violent crimes increased 15 percent nationwide.\nMr. Mannichl has been known for his hard line against the extreme right, but earned the particular enmity of neo-Nazi groups after ordering the opening of the grave of a prominent former Nazi, Friedhelm Busse, after his death last July. Mr. Busse was buried with a flag bearing a swastika, which is outlawed in Germany, and the police removed the flag as evidence.\nAround 5:30 p.m. on Dec. 13, an attacker plunged a knife into Mr. Mannichl\u2019s chest outside his home on a quiet residential street in the tiny town of F\u00fcrstenzell near Passau, narrowly missing his heart, according to news reports. Mr. Mannichl said after the attack that his attacker yelled, \u201cGreetings from the national resistance\u201d and \u201cYou won\u2019t be trampling on the graves of our comrades anymore.\u201d\nThe attack made headlines nationwide, as did a candlelight vigil in Mr. Mannichl\u2019s honor. \u201cWhen anyone is attacked by a right-wing extremist, it is an attack on us all,\u201d said Chancellor Angela Merkel in an interview the next week.\nThe day after the attack, the police arrested two men, ages 26 and 27, in connection with the crime. Two days later, a couple from Munich were detained for questioning as potential accomplices.\nYet all four were quickly released. And the questions began to mount, in particular around the fact that the knife used in the attack reportedly came from Mr. Mannichl\u2019s house. He explained that it had been used for cutting gingerbread during a neighborhood Advent celebration and that it had been left outside, where the assailant could have picked it up.\nHeinz Fromm, the president of the domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, said publicly that the office had no evidence linking the crime to right-wing extremists. And conjecture about the case, and Mr. Mannichl, evolved into a popular parlor game from Passau clear to the capital, Berlin.\nThe national news magazine Stern later reported that it was \u201cmore or less being openly speculated that the police chief could have been the victim of a family drama\u201d and might have sent his own police force on a wild goose chase.\nOther possibilities aired publicly included the attacker was from the punk or goth scene or was an angry criminal out for revenge who only pretended to be a neo-Nazi to disguise his identity.\nMr. Mannichl declined to be interviewed for this article, but told a Munich newspaper last month that he was trying to live with the \u201cvirulent speculation.\u201d He described the questions surrounding the case as \u201ca deep valley\u201d in his life.\nMembers of the local N.P.D., who have long accused Mr. Mannichl of harassment, organized a protest against what they called unfair \u201cbaiting\u201d of the right wing in connection with the case. On Jan. 4, some 200 far-right demonstrators from all over Germany gathered in Passau, where they were confronted by roughly 1,000 counterprotesters and nearly as many police officers. There were several arrests but no violence.\nFor Passau, a city of 50,000 that sits at the confluence of three rivers, the Inn, the Ilz and the Danube, and seeks to lure tourists to the narrow lanes of its quaintly lovely medieval old town, it was all an unwelcome return to what officials call an unfair reputation as a \u201cbrown city,\u201d a reference to the brown shirts that came to identify the Nazi party.\nPassau gained international notoriety as a symbol of Germany\u2019s uneasy relationship with its past in the Academy Award-nominated film \u201cThe Nasty Girl,\u201d based on the true story of Anna Rosmus, who faced death threats when she began looking into the Nazi past of her hometown in 1980 when she was 19.\nPassau remained a popular gathering spot for the far right, both the N.P.D. and the German People\u2019s Union, until just a few years ago, because of its connection to famous Nazis (Hitler lived here for two years as a child) but also because they could hold their local gatherings in Nibelung Hall, a 1934 example of Nazi architecture.\nBut the city has steadily evolved into a more cosmopolitan, open place. A university established here in 1978 brought 8,000 students and a cultural shot in the arm.\nThe fall of the Iron Curtain and the integration of Europe has turned Passau\u2019s location in what was once an isolated corner of Germany into a crossroads and a destination. Nibelung Hall was torn down in 2004, and its replacement is called the Dreil\u00e4nderhalle, or Hall of Three Lands.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/europe/12passau.html", "title": "Ancient City\u2019s Nazi Past Seeps Out After Stabbing", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH"}
{"date": "Sat, 07 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Advisers to President Obama are preparing three options for escalating the war effort in Afghanistan, all of them calling for more American troops, as he moves closer to a decision on the way forward in the eight-year-old war, officials said Saturday.\nThe options include Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal\u2019s request for roughly another 40,000 troops; a middle scenario sending about 30,000 more troops; and a lower alternative involving 20,000 to 25,000 reinforcements, according to the officials, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Officials hope to present the options to Mr. Obama this week before he leaves on a trip to Asia.\nWhile some civilian and military officials believe Mr. Obama is seeking a middle ground in the debate over Afghanistan, aides denied he has made any decision or is leaning toward any of the options. Still, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates appears to be supportive of the middle option, some officials said, and his view is thought to be pivotal because of Mr. Obama\u2019s respect for him and his status as a holdover from a Republican administration.\nThe three options define the contours of a debate that has played out in public for more than two months. General McChrystal, the top American and allied commander in Afghanistan, and his advocates argue the war cannot be won without a major infusion of forces to protect the population and ultimately turn it against the Taliban. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and others oppose a buildup in a war they believe cannot be won through conventional means and that diverts attention from Pakistan, where Al Qaeda is primarily located. There are currently 68,000 American troops in Afghanistan.\nThe range of alternatives under discussion suggests that the president has rejected the extremes on either end. He appears inclined to send more troops \u2014 with the only question being how many \u2014 and seems not to be seriously considering General McChrystal\u2019s highest proposal of 80,000 more troops.\nStill, any of the options on the table would generate opposition on either the political left or right. If he approves anything less than General McChrystal\u2019s 40,000-troop option, Mr. Obama could face criticism from Republicans and some moderate Democrats, while any troop increase would provoke anger among liberals and others who have increasingly soured on the war.\nMcClatchy Newspapers reported Saturday that Mr. Obama is nearing a decision to approve the middle option being drawn up by advisers, citing unnamed administration and military officials. White House officials denied Mr. Obama has made a decision or favors any of the options at this point, noting that they have not been formally presented to him. But administration officials confirmed that the 30,000-troop plan is under consideration.\nIf he were to go with that, Mr. Obama could try to make up the difference in what General McChrystal wants by pressing NATO allies to do more. Britain has already agreed to send another 500 troops, and four senior American officials flew to Brussels last week to brief representatives of other nations that have forces in Afghanistan, to solicit their views and build support for more help.\nThere could be variations within each of the three options as well that could increase or decrease the number of troops needed, officials said. Troop levels would hinge, for instance, on the administration\u2019s assessment of how many former Taliban fighters can be peacefully reintegrated into Afghan society and to what extent improved governance at various levels could prevent disaffected Afghans from siding with insurgents.\nOfficials are focusing on an approach predicated on the belief that the Taliban cannot be entirely eradicated in Afghanistan and that Al Qaeda is the real threat to American interests. The main goal for American forces, then, would be to protect the 10 most important population centers in Afghanistan and keep the Taliban isolated long enough to train Afghan security forces to take over the fight.\nMr. Obama has met with his national security advisers seven times since General McChrystal sent his assessment Aug. 31. Officials hope to schedule another meeting this week.\nThe president\u2019s departure for Asia was delayed a day until Thursday so that he can fly to Fort Hood on Tuesday for a service commemorating the victims of last week\u2019s mass shooting.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/world/asia/08troops.html", "title": "All Afghan War Options by Obama Aides Said to Call for More Troops", "author": "PETER BAKER and HELENE COOPER"}

{"date": "Wed, 12 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court ordered 22 indigenous people freed from prison on Wednesday after finding that federal prosecutors used forged evidence and false testimony to implicate them in a 1997 massacre in a tiny hamlet in Chiapas.\nGunmen crept down a hillside into Acteal on Dec. 22, 1997, and opened fire on the local population, killing 45 people, including pregnant women and young children. The case, which drew international outrage, prompted Ernesto Zedillo, then the president, to order a vigorous investigation of the crime.\nThe deaths have haunted the community ever since, as both the victims and perpetrators were impoverished Tzotzil Indians who lived side by side. Of the 79 people convicted of participating in the killings, 57 joined to appeal their convictions.\nIn a 4-to-1 vote that laid bare the deficiencies of the Mexican criminal justice system, the court ruled that prosecutors and lower court judges had violated the rights of 22 of the accused in their rush to justice. The court ordered that four more prisoners be resentenced and said the convictions of 31 others would be reviewed in the coming days.\nJustices remarked that they were not ruling on the guilt or innocence of the accused but were making a statement about the bungled prosecution.\n\u201cActeal is a good opportunity for the court to reiterate a clear message to the authorities in charge of pursuing crimes \u2014 your actions ought to always respect, scrupulously, the Constitution and human rights,\u201d said Juan Silva Meza, one of the judges backing the decision.\nFrom the very beginning, the massacre has been mired in confusion. It appeared to stem from the rebel revolt begun by the Zapatistas on New Year\u2019s Day in 1994. The people of Acteal formed a group called Las Abejas, or the Bees, which backed the rebels. But some neighboring communities sided with the government.\nGovernment investigations in subsequent years showed that officials and police officers ignored warnings of impending violence and then tampered with the crime scene afterward. In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, an aggressive investigation was conducted, one that defense lawyers said used the horror over the killings to round up rebel sympathizers who were nowhere near Acteal that day.\nOutside the court on Wednesday, the deep divisions still associated with the case were on full display. Representatives of Las Abejas gathered at the entrance to denounce the decision to free those convicted of killing their relatives. They predicted more violence and said the court would have blood on its hands if the released prisoners took up arms out of vengeance.\n\u201cI want to make it very clear that the government is letting free assassins, people who killed women and children in cold blood,\u201d said Matzuwa Villasana, 63, a member of Las Abejas. \u201cThey ought to be in prison.\u201d\nDown the street, relatives of the accused men celebrated the decision, which they said righted a terrible wrong.\nThe appeal was headed by Javier Angulo, who teaches constitutional law at Mexico City\u2019s Center for Investigation and Economic Studies. He called the Acteal case one of the country\u2019s longest and most complex legal matters.\nOne of the suspect pieces of evidence introduced by prosecutors was a detailed list of the perpetrators of the massacre supposedly prepared by Agust\u00edn Arias D\u00edaz, a local resident. But the list was written in Spanish, a language he barely spoke, and he later acknowledged that he was handed the list by the authorities.\n\u201cIt could be that they were innocent or guilty,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Coss\u00edo D\u00edaz, one of the judges, who criticized the authorities for inventing evidence. \u201cThat\u2019s not my function as a constitutional judge.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/world/americas/13mexico.html", "title": "Mexico Court Orders 22 Tied to \u201997 Killings Freed", "author": "MARC LACEY"}

{"date": "Thu, 07 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "VATICAN CITY \u2014 When Pope John Paul II traveled to the Holy Land in 2000, the visit was history, the first by a pope to recognize the state of Israel or visit sites holy to Islam.\nWhen Benedict XVI travels on Friday to Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories, it will be much more about him personally. A man whose four-year papacy has been marked by missteps that angered and offended Jews and Muslims will deliver 32 speeches at some of the holiest sites in the world to Muslims, Jews and Christians. Each word will be scrutinized, particularly by listeners with little affection for him. Already, Islamic groups in Jordan are protesting.\n\u201cThe thing that worries me most is the speech that the pope will deliver here,\u201d Archbishop Fouad Twal, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, told the Israeli daily Haaretz on Wednesday. \u201cOne word for the Muslims and I\u2019m in trouble; one word for the Jews and I\u2019m in trouble. At the end of the visit the pope goes back to Rome and I stay here with the consequences.\u201d\nBut for the Vatican, Benedict\u2019s trip is an opportunity to urge Palestinians and Israelis toward peace and to continue his assiduous efforts to improve his standing with Jews and Muslims.\n\u201cThe trip is very important and very complex,\u201d the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said this week. He called the journey \u201can act of hope and faith toward peace and reconciliation.\u201d Given the tensions in the region, he added, \u201cit seems a brave gesture.\u201d\nIn the works since last fall, Benedict\u2019s trip comes at a time of change and uncertainty in the region. Israel just ushered in a new right-wing government, that of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And the two main Palestinian factions remain hostile and divided, with the secular Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, controlling the West Bank, and the Islamist group Hamas ruling Gaza.\nEmotions are still raw after 1,300 Palestinians were killed in the Israeli military assault on Gaza in January, which some at the Vatican opposed.\nBut Vatican officials say the pope was eager to make the trip, no matter the conditions, given his age. He turned 82 last month. Benedict sparked global outrage in January by revoking the excommunication of a schismatic bishop from an ultratraditionalist sect \u2014 a Briton, Richard Williamson, who had recently been filmed denying the scope of the Holocaust. Many Jews had already viewed Benedict with some suspicion, given that he is a German who was forced into the Hitler Youth and the German Army in World War II.\nAfter Jews and Catholics alike said the church\u2019s moral authority had been eroded by the Williamson episode, Benedict issued an unprecedented personal letter in March explaining his motives. And in Israel, he will likely be able to draw on reserves of good will for his many years, as a cardinal, improving once tense relations between Catholics and Jews. He will visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and meet with survivors.\nHis visit comes three years after he offended many Muslims with a speech in Regensburg, Germany, in which he quoted a Byzantine emperor who said Islam encouraged violence and brought things \u201cevil and inhuman.\u201d To make amends, he reached out to various Muslim groups and prayed in the Blue Mosque in Istanbul on a trip to Turkey two months after the speech. And he will continue that effort in Jordan, where he arrives on Friday and will visit a mosque and meet with Muslim clerics and scholars.\n\u201cHis willingness to open up to members of other faith communities is obviously a welcome development,\u201d said Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesman for the Common Word initiative, a group of Muslim leaders and scholars that began a dialogue with the Vatican after the Regensburg speech.\nBenedict will also visit Mount Nebo, the spot from which Moses is believed to have seen the Promised Land.\nOn Monday, Benedict lands in Tel Aviv for four intense days in Israel that will include visits to the Western Wall, holy to Jews; and, sacred to Catholics, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and the hall where Jesus is believed to have had the Last Supper. In Jerusalem he will visit the religious compound in the Old City known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount.\nThe Vatican\u2019s Jewish interlocutors say they hope the trip will mend fences, while Israeli officials hope it will boost Christian tourism to the region.\nThe trip is an important opportunity for the pope \u201cto demonstrate visually,\u201d that the relationship between Jews and Catholics \u201chas continued to flourish since the visit of John Paul II,\u201d said Rabbi David Rosen, chairman of International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations.\nIn recent months, tensions have brewed between Israel and the Vatican over a plaque in Yad Vashem criticizing Pope Pius XII for not doing enough to save Jews during the Holocaust. Pius, who served from 1939 until 1958, is on track for sainthood.\nIsraeli officials sidestepped the issue by having the pope visit the Hall of Remembrance at Yad Vashem, but not the museum.\nTensions are even higher over the visit to Bethlehem, where Palestinians erected a stage for the pope next to a portion of the separation barrier that Israel has been building to wall itself off from the West Bank. But after complaints from Israel, the Vatican nuncio said that Benedict would speak from a nearby United Nations school.\nThere, Benedict is expected to make a speech calling attention to a pressing concern of the Catholic Church: the rapidly declining number of Christians in the Middle East. Although Christians have remained about 2 percent of Israel\u2019s population since its founding, their presence in places like Bethlehem has decreased radically in past decades.\nFaced with poverty and unemployment, many Palestinians are \u201cnot too optimistic about the pope\u2019s visit,\u201d said Mohammed Dajani, the founder of the Wasatia Movement that promotes moderation in Islam and director of American Studies department at Al-Quds University.\n\u201cPeople are saying the pope is pro-Israel, that he wants to please Israel, so they don\u2019t have much hope from the visit,\u201d Mr. Dajani added.\nIn a message on Wednesday, Benedict addressed the people of the places on his itinerary. \u201cMy primary intention is to visit the places made holy by the life of Jesus, and, to pray at them for the gift of peace and unity for your families, and all those for whom the Holy Land and the Middle East is home.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/world/middleeast/08pope.html", "title": "Pope, Hope in Hand, Is Heading to Mideast", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}
{"date": "Tue, 13 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 The feud between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas prices and transit fees has left large swaths of Europe without heat. Yet, what is baffling is that the dispute has always seemed overly technical and easily resolved, if there was the slightest desire on either side. After all, both countries stand to profit from selling fuel to Europe.\nThe latest agreement collapsed Tuesday, in a familiar cacophony of complaints and countercomplaints, and again over a seemingly trivial issue. With European Union monitors along the pipeline to make sure that Ukraine did not divert any gas for its own use, Russia agreed to resume shipments to Europe.\nBut rather than repressuring the Ukrainian pipeline system for exports, Russia\u2019s gas monopoly, Gazprom, ordered a single test shipment to see if it would pass through Ukraine to Europe, through a pipeline that was being used to supply the Ukrainian city of Odessa. Ukrainian authorities refused, saying they did not want to cut supplies to their own people, and Russia again halted shipments \u2014 not, some experts believed, reluctantly.\nPolitical experts say that neither side is motivated to settle the dispute, because it has never been about the stated issues. Instead, it has been a proxy for far more fundamental and insoluble matters, particularly Ukraine\u2019s 2004 turn to the West in the \u201cOrange Revolution,\u201d which deeply shook Russia\u2019s nationalists.\n\u201cThe Russian side is appealing to a lot of technical details to explain why it still wants the conflict to go on,\u201d Vladimir S. Milov, president of the Institute of Energy Policy in Moscow and a former deputy energy minister of Russia, said in a telephone interview.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear to see the desire to pressure the Ukrainian politicians, and pressure them that if they continue to pursue a pro-Western course and not adhere to the rules imposed by Moscow on the post-Soviet space, they will face difficulties,\u201d he said.\nNationalists in Moscow could swallow the loss of the Baltic states and Russia\u2019s former colonies in Central Asia, but they will never accept the notion of Ukrainians, about 17 percent of whom are ethnic Russians, as members of an independent, Western-oriented state, and potentially in NATO, no less.\nSome other analysts point to the aftermath of last summer\u2019s Georgian conflict as another sticking point, noting that after the war Russia\u2019s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, had claimed a \u201cprivileged sphere of influence\u201d over former Soviet states.\n\u201cThis is a continuation of the Russian-Georgian war, only by other means,\u201d Grigory N. Perepelitsa, director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, an arm of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere it was tanks, here it is gas.\u201d\nThis time, though, Europe is suffering as well, with hundreds of thousands of people in southeastern Europe living without heat for six days and factories shutting down in several countries.\nPia Ahrenkilde Hansen, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said: \u201cLittle or no gas is currently flowing. We are not at this stage jumping to conclusions. But this situation is obviously very serious and needs to improve rapidly. We do need to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\nBut getting to the bottom of Russia\u2019s goals, said Mr. Perepelitsa of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, goes well beyond the industrial details of gas transit.\nAuthorities in Moscow are seeking to discredit the Ukrainian leadership and portray Ukraine as a failed state, he said, while demonstrating to Central European nations that have supported Ukraine\u2019s membership in NATO that they can freeze if they continue to do so.\nAlso in play is a deep personal animosity between Russia\u2019s prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, and Ukraine\u2019s president, Viktor A. Yushchenko.\nMr. Yushchenko\u2019s face was disfigured in a 2004 poisoning that has never been solved, but for which many in Ukraine reflexively blame Russia. As it did in the disputed enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia before the Georgian war, Moscow has striven to divide Ukraine politically, broadcasting Russian-language television into the country, handing out citizenship to ethnic Russians in Crimea and, critics say, backing pro-Russian figures in Ukraine\u2019s political establishment.\nRussian officials, meanwhile, say Mr. Yushchenko has stirred up conflict with Russia to detract attention from his dismal performance on the economy during the financial crisis.\nOn Tuesday, Aleksandr I. Medvedev, Gazprom\u2019s deputy chief executive, raised a new allegation, saying that Ukraine had been taking orders from Washington after the United States and Ukraine signed a partnership agreement in December that included a clause on energy cooperation.\nMr. Medvedev did not explain why the United States would seek to disrupt relations, not to speak of the gas supply. In a statement, the United States Embassy in Moscow said that the allegation was \u201cbaseless.\u201d\nBut the ties between Russia and Ukraine, the two most populous successor states of the Soviet Union, are a tangle of alliances and vendettas, mercurial and often inscrutable. Mr. Putin, for example, openly backed Viktor F. Yanukovich, whom Mr. Yushchenko defeated in the 2004 elections after the Orange Revolution protests.\nYet, one of the leaders of those protests, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, has recently seemed to be leaning toward Moscow, refraining for a time from criticizing Russia\u2019s war in Georgia.\nIndeed, so frustrated were some European Union officials by the latest bad turn in the gas dispute, some began to speculate privately that the two nations might be colluding to seed chaos on energy markets and drive up the price of the fuel that is their mutual business venture.\nBloomberg News reported Tuesday that the cutoff had caused spot prices in Europe to rise to a three-year high of $8.60 per million B.T.U.\u2019s, compared with $5.52 in the United States. With prices expected to fall steeply this year, that could produce at least some welcome pocket change for Gazprom.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/world/europe/14gazprom.html", "title": "Gas Dispute Runs Deeper Than Pipes, Experts Say", "author": "ANDREW E.

Five people died in the cells while I was there, and sometimes they didn\u2019t collect the corpse for four days.\u201d\nHe said he had shared a cell with 11 men in a space designed to hold 6. \u201cPrisoners are full of sores, and there is a terrible infestation of lice because no one can wash with soap,\u201d Mr. Bennett said.\nMore difficult times may await Mr. Bennett. He was arrested on the day he was to have been sworn in as deputy agricultural minister in Zimbabwe\u2019s new power-sharing government. He still faces charges on three-year-old allegations that involve the possession of weapons and a plot to use them to sabotage the state. He calls the accusations \u201ctotally trumped up.\u201d\nThe way the justice system operates in the case may well reflect the viability of the new government itself, a reluctant marriage of bitter enemies. Leading one side is Robert Mugabe, 85, the president who has run Zimbabwe with an iron fist for nearly three decades. Leading the other is the newly named prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, a former labor leader who has suffered beatings and jail, as have many of his followers.\nMr. Bennett has been a mainstay of the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change. He said he viewed his arrest as an example of the ill will that jeopardized the unity government.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure where these charges come from, but there are obviously still people in the government who have not received the power-sharing arrangement with any spirit of reconciliation,\u201d he said.\nMr. Bennett was once a prosperous farmer. His coffee plantation was seized early in the decade as part of an effort to wrest property from white landowners. He grew more active in politics, winning a seat in Parliament.\nIn 2004, with land confiscations under debate in the legislature, Mr. Bennett, enraged by a remark, pushed Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa. This shove cost Mr. Bennett eight months in prison.\nMr. Chinamasa, again justice minister, \u201cstill bears a grudge against me for pushing him down in Parliament,\u201d Mr. Bennett said Thursday.\nRepeated efforts to reach Mr. Chinamasa for comment were unsuccessful.\nAfter this most recent arrest, Mr. Bennett was twice granted bail, but the government kept appealing until the matter reached the Supreme Court.\nThe conditions of his release include $5,000 in bail, a requirement that he report to the police in Harare, the capital, three times a week and the surrender of his passport. In 2006, Mr. Bennett went into exile in South Africa, returning only last month to join the new government.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/world/africa/13zimbabwe.html", "title": "Zimbabwe Opposition Figure Is Freed on Bail After Delays", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}

{"date": "Thu, 29 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JOHANNESBURG \u2014 South Africa is a young democracy, and this week its people are pondering a question of press freedom achingly familiar to Americans: Is the sex life of the president any of the public\u2019s business?\nOn Jan. 25, under the headline \u201cAll the president\u2019s women,\u201d The Sunday Independent portrayed a risqu\u00e9 situation in which two women were vying for the affection of President Kgalema Motlanthe \u2014 and neither one was his wife.\nAccording to the story, Mr. Motlanthe, 59, is estranged from his longtime wife, intimately involved with a 45-year-old political colleague and yet also the lover of a third woman, a 24-year-old \u201cbelieved to be in the final stages of pregnancy with his child.\u201d The newspaper asked: Who is our first lady?\nThe president refused to comment when contacted by The Independent, and though the story relied heavily on that journalistic bugaboo anonymous sources it did contain a curious denial from the youngest of the three women: \u201cI\u2019m not a public figure. Kgalema is the public figure. And it\u2019s not for me to be dragged into this story just because some people feel they want to know who he\u2019s dating and what he\u2019s doing and when he\u2019s doing it.\u201d\nAnd so there it was, salacious whispers ascendant into salacious print. The public and the pundits were left wondering: Is this stuff true? If so, what difference does it make? Are public officials not entitled to privacy on matters deeply personal?\nOpinions in the debate are predictably divided, giving talk radio plenty to talk about and making Letters to the Editor columns easy to fill. On Thursday, in The Times, another newspaper here, one reader expressed himself succinctly: \u201cPrivate work: private life. Public work: NO private life.\u201d\nCarl Niehaus, a spokesman for Mr. Motlanthe\u2019s political party, the African National Congress, takes the view that the story is an invasion of privacy. In an opinion article for The Times, he even seemed to plead, come on, give the guy a break: \u201cHe might be estranged from his wife, as the reports suggest, but is he the first president in the world to experience such challenges?\u201d\nMr. Niehaus and many others have also raised the usual ancillary questions about a sexual expos\u00e9. Where did this information come from? What is the motivation of the source? Who is trying to get back at whom?\nThis episode arises as the party is facing election-time competition from a disaffected splinter group that calls itself the Congress of the People. Might these A.N.C. malcontents be leaking gossip about their old comrades? Or could there be back-stabbing within the A.N.C. itself?\nBusiness Day, a financial newspaper, wrote: \u201cThe A.N.C. has dismissed the reports on Motlanthe as a political smear campaign, and it is almost certainly right. It is not altogether clear, however, who is doing the smearing.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, in an unusual first-person article in the newspaper The Star labeled \u201cThe great debate,\u201d Fiona Forde, the reporter who wrote the initial story, denied being the conduit for a malicious leak. She said her work instead involved old-fashioned shoe leather and had begun with innocent curiosity. We know so much about Michelle Obama, Jackie Kennedy and Hillary Rodham Clinton, she wrote. Her original mission was to learn more about her own nation\u2019s first lady.\nShe took offense at charges of malicious motivation. \u201cThe reaction to the expos\u00e9 this week is as much a reflection of the state of the A.N.C.\u2019s internal politics as it is anything else,\u201d Ms. Forde said.\nThe African National Congress, the liberation party once led by Nelson Mandela, has governed this country since independence in 1994, always winning overwhelming majorities in Parliament, the body that actually elects the president. With one party so powerful, its standard-bearer does not face the same electoral pressure to be marketed to the masses and opened up for rigorous inspection by the media as in the United States, for instance.\nUltimately, it may not matter much whether Mr. Motlanthe has any genuine peccadilloes to disclose. He is simply a caretaker president who took over in September when the party demanded that one of its own, Thabo Mbeki, step down. After elections in a few months, the man expected to assume the nation\u2019s highest office is the A.N.C. leader, Jacob Zuma, and if Mr. Motlanthe\u2019s romantic entanglements seem eventful, Mr. Zuma\u2019s could be considered hyperactive.\n\u201cI do, I do, I do, I do\u201d is the way one recent headline summed up his marital predilections. A Zulu who practices polygamy, which is legal in South Africa, Mr. Zuma was at the time in the process of marrying for the fifth time, a year after taking bride No. 4 and amid rumors he was already thinking of elevating a girlfriend as No. 6.\nMr. Zuma, 66, considers his family life to be a thoroughly private matter, as does Mr. Motlanthe, and he refuses to discuss his marriages or to disclose the number of children he has fathered.\nHis secrecy does not seem motivated by any shame about so abundant a family life. To the contrary, what little he says about it shows undiluted pride. He once said in a television interview: \u201cThere are plenty of politicians who have mistresses and children that they hide so as to pretend they\u2019re monogamous. I prefer to be open. I love my wives and I\u2019m proud of my children.\u201d\nHe implied that he had much more to tell the public about his family, but that, as he routinely asserts, it was none of their business.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/world/africa/30safrica.html", "title": "South African Leader\u2019s Sex Life Stirs Salacious Gossip and Privacy Debate", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}

{"date": "Thu, 29 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSUL, Iraq \u2014 The thud of the car bomb was familiar, if in this case close, rattling the windows and puffing out the drapes.\n\u201cThis is our fate,\u201d Mohammed Shakir, 67, the top candidate running for the local council with the Iraqi Islamic Party, said post-boom a few days before the provincial elections here. \u201cThere is no politics when there is chaos and car bombing.\u201d\nAround a largely quiet Iraq, the elections on Saturday \u2014 considered crucial as the first widely contested balloting since the American invasion in 2003 \u2014 will take place in something like normality.\nBut in Mosul, the chief city in the north, long torn between Arabs and Kurds, the violence has not ended. A civilian died in this car bombing. A day later a bomb exploded down the street from the Kurdish Democratic Party headquarters, killing four Iraqi soldiers.\nThis is the test of the provincial elections in Mosul, a last bastion of the Sunni and jihadi insurgency: whether a political system that more closely reflects local ethnic and sectarian splits will be a first step toward stability. The issue is the same in places around Iraq where calm is still fragile: whether democracy can trump violence.\nThere are some encouraging signs here in Mosul, even if many people fear the elections are simply another means for Arabs and Kurds to continue their bloody struggle over land, oil and sovereignty. Certainly there is no progress on the more threatening issue of Kirkuk, a city to the southeast so full of oil and ethnic tension that elections there were postponed.\nBut politics are changing here. In the last provincial elections, in 2005, most Arabs boycotted. As a result, Kurdish groups, who make up at most a third of the city, hold 31 out of 41 seats on the provincial council in Mosul and surrounding Nineveh Province. The provinces have broad local authority to spend and govern.\nNow the council has 37 seats, and Arabs, represented by two main parties, are expected to win, and Kurds largely accept that \u2014 one reason, many here say, that the violence, while still much higher than in most of Iraq, has not flared more. On Thursday night, however, a candidate who is an adviser on tribal affairs to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki was assassinated outside his house in Mosul. But even if it is too dangerous for candidates to shake hands in the streets, where wild dogs rove over rubble and garbage, 55 voter registration stations survived the campaign unscathed.\n\u201cPeople think these elections will be different,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Hassan Kareem Khidir, commander of Iraqi Army operations in Nineveh, who has much to gain from the calm. Outside his fortified office a plaque lists the names of 523 security officers killed just since May. \u201cThe major factor in Nineveh is not security or military \u2014 it\u2019s political,\u201d he said.\nBut the full picture is more clouded and complex, a backdrop for the long-running tensions between Kurds and Arabs that many fear may intensify after the elections.\nOne major struggle is local control, embodied in these elections and which the Kurds advocate, versus the strong central state that Saddam Hussein long used to keep in line Iraq\u2019s Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds and other groups.\nAfter the Kurds ruled the city for four years \u2014 a time of extreme violence, with the latest killings last fall forcing thousands of Christians to flee Mosul \u2014 Kurdish groups readily concede that Arabs should control the city itself.\n\u201cOf course the Arabs have the majority here,\u201d said Kisro Goran, 48, the deputy governor, who despite his second-rank title is the most powerful politician in Mosul and is overseeing the campaign for the largely Kurdish grouping Brotherly Nineveh. \u201cWe will not collect more than what we are. We are only one-third so we won\u2019t get more than that.\u201d\nBut he is equally frank that their real goal is winning rural areas outside the city \u2014 places where Kurds say they have a majority and that, they argue, should ultimately belong to the nearby autonomous enclave of Kurdistan. The Kurds have long been frustrated by the failure of international promises for a census and referendum to settle Kurdish claims, particularly in Kirkuk.\nSo Mr. Goran said the elections would serve as their own census, he hoped, to further the Kurds\u2019 agenda.\n\u201cWe are looking not only to know our political size but our ethnic size,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can we know the truth? By democratic means. We don\u2019t want to force any identity on anyone. Voters will choose what identity they want.\u201d\nTalk like this infuriates Arabs, who accuse the Kurds of using the elections not for the unity of Iraq but its dissolution. The issues run from impossibly complex \u2014 should Yazidis, a non-Muslim Kurdish-speaking minority, count as Kurds? \u2014 to explosive.\nAtheel al-Nujaifi, leader of the list al-Hudba, a largely Sunni Arab slate that seems set to win the most votes, said that Kurds were using the election to solidify control over areas around the Mosul dam, strategic for water supply and near an oil pipeline. In theory, Arab gains in this election would be a force against what they see as Kurdish expansion \u2014 another possible source of conflict. \u201cIn these areas they have militias,\u201d said Mr. Nujaifi, 51, a businessman who owns a satellite channel and breeds horses that were favored by Saddam Hussein\u2019s sons. \u201cI am worried the votes won\u2019t be fair.\u201d\n\u201cWe think the elections are for political parties,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not for nationalities to decide their final fate.\u201d\nAnd thus these elections are studded with contradictions: On one side, the prospect for fairer representation and less violence in the city. Most parties, Arab and Kurdish alike, are pledging to work together in a possible coalition government after the elections (Mr. Goran, however, has ruled out working with the candidates on the slate from al-Hudba.) On the other side, there appears to be rising suspicion between Arabs and Kurds, worsened by the widening gap, in safety and prosperity, between Iraq proper and Kurdistan.\nMore and more, the roads out of Mosul feel like an international boundary, with checkpoints and virtual customs stops before the Kurdish cities of Dohuk and Erbil. While Mosul is battened down and tense, Kurdistan is safe and lively, full of construction, car dealerships and nice Turkish washing machines for sale. Arabs say that, despite their holding Iraqi passports, Kurdish pesh merga troops harass them and admit them only grudgingly.\n\u201cI went to Erbil the other day and they wouldn\u2019t let me in without somebody guaranteeing me,\u201d said Haithem Abdul-Wahab, 44, as he stretched a huge campaign poster for the Iraqi Islamic Party on an iron frame. \u201cI had an Iraqi flag in my car and they tore it.\u201d\nA nearby security guard, Abdullah Wa\u2019ad, 30, shouted out, \u201cWe don\u2019t want Kurds in Mosul!\u201d\nThe feeling is much the same in a disputed village north of Mosul, a few miles from the dam, populated by 21 Kurdish families. The village\u2019s name in Kurdish is Ghani Shireen, but it was given an Arab name, Ain Hilwa, after eight Arab families were forced to move there in 1991 as part of Saddam Hussein\u2019s effort to \u201cArabize\u201d the area and dilute Kurdish control. The Arab families left after the Americans, allied with the Kurds, arrived in 2003.\nNow many worry what it will mean for them with Arabs likely to be in control of the provincial council. Saddiq Abdullah, 48, bitter at having been thrown off his land when the Arabs arrived, said it would be good if these elections helped inch Kurdistan closer to his village.\n\u201cKurdistan is a stable and safe country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would sleep there without bombs or worries.\u201d\nBut for all the ethnic and sectarian politics, there is a small voice \u2014 rising in Mosul and elsewhere in Iraq \u2014 that is looking for competence first.\nFiras Jamil, 25, a Kurd who owns an electronics shop in Mosul\u2019s barricaded downtown, listed his priorities: better electricity and water; unblocked streets; more jobs; and of course greater safety.\nFor that, he is turning to al-Hudba, perhaps Arab but in his mind more capable.\n\u201cHere we vote for the political party that would serve the interests of the city,\u201d he said, \u201cregardless of ethnic identification.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/world/middleeast/30mosul.html", "title": "Iraqi Elections Face Crucial Test in Violent Mosul", "author": "IAN FISHER"}
{"date": "Sat, 11 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Among the people in Moscow still haunted by the unfinished business of Paul Klebnikov\u2019s murder in July 2004, Alexei V. Rybin stands out.\nMr. Rybin, 46, happened to sit on the jury that acquitted two Chechen men in the killing of Mr. Klebnikov, an American journalist who moved here to publish the Russian-language edition of Forbes magazine. An intense man who has migrated from medicine to publishing to finance during the post-Soviet era, Mr. Rybin argued strenuously against the verdict and filled seven spiral notebooks with his dense, neat handwriting during the trial.\nThree years later, he is still so tormented by the outcome that he has repeatedly violated court rules by discussing it publicly.\n\u201cTo the end of my life,\u201d he said, \u201cit won\u2019t leave me.\u201d\nDuring the United States-Russia summit meeting last week, American officials again lobbied Russian officials to push harder on the Klebnikov case, which has dissipated into a collection of loose ends and dead ends. Russian prosecutors announced that they would begin working with a local representative of the United States Department of Justice.\nIt was not supposed to turn out this way. Mr. Klebnikov\u2019s relatives say that four years ago, Vladimir V. Putin, then the president, told them he knew who the killers were and urged them to have faith in the Russian justice system.\nWhat happened after that, though, underlined some of the failures of that system. Prosecutors identified five Chechen men they suspected of ordering and carrying out the killing but were able to arrest only two suspects accused of being hit men. The closed trial ended in acquittals. Though Russia\u2019s Supreme Court overturned the verdict and called for a new trial, one of the suspects had already fled. At that point, the process apparently quietly stalled.\n\u201cIt gets whittled down,\u201d said Peter Klebnikov, who flew to Moscow last week for a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of his brother\u2019s fatal shooting on a Moscow street. \u201cThey chip away at the resolve of the family and the people who care about it. It\u2019s death by 1,000 blows.\u201d\nThe Klebnikov case has been frustrated by many of the same missteps that doomed the trial in the killing of the Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya.\nBoth involved bit players who were prosecuted largely on circumstantial evidence. Russian prosecutors have no tradition of, and little legal basis for, persuading low-level criminals to testify against their bosses.\nIn both cases, key figures simply vanished, into Chechnya or overseas. Both cases were tried before juries, which are relatively new and rare in Russia and which have proved vulnerable to threats and intimidation. And both cases were so heavily freighted with international political meaning that many concluded that, as Peter Klebnikov put it, \u201cpowerful sources in the government don\u2019t want a successful conclusion to the case.\u201d\nIgor Korotkov, the lawyer who successfully defended one of the Chechen suspects, Kazbek Dukuzov, in the murder trial, dismisses that idea.\n\u201cIt was a matter of honor for them to find the culprits and crack this case,\u201d he said. \u201cThis probably hurt more than it helped, because the investigators were under pressure, the case attracted so much attention. The desire to catch the criminals as soon as possible made them rush, and this interfered with the quality of their work.\u201d\nFor Mr. Rybin, participating in a jury trial was a matter of both curiosity and duty. Jury trials were revived in Russia 16 years ago, but are used only in select cases, usually for serious crimes like murder. Russian juries acquit defendants in 15 to 20 percent of cases, compared with less than 1 percent for judges, said Leonid Nikitinsky, a legal reporter at the newspaper Novaya Gazeta. The Supreme Court frequently overturns jury verdicts, which Russian law allows.\nJurors often emerge from the experience profoundly affected, said Mr. Nikitinsky, who has founded a club for former jurors.\nCertainly, that is what happened to Mr. Rybin. \u201cFrom the beginning to the end,\u201d he said, \u201cI took it as a kind of mission.\u201d\nAs soon as they gathered, Mr. Rybin said, the jurors could tell they had been assigned to something big.\nMr. Klebnikov\u2019s murder was one of four cases being prosecuted against the two Chechen men, Mr. Dukuzov and Musa Vakhayev, and testimony sometimes took a wild turn. At one point, the jurors watched from a window as a witness fled the courthouse pursued by five men in masks, then was tackled, handcuffed and put in the back of a van.\n\u201cThe judge called a break, because what else could he do?\u201d Mr. Rybin said. \u201cIt was just like a movie.\u201d\nMr. Rybin\u2019s story cannot be verified, because no other jurors have come forward publicly, but he said he was sure the jury came under pressure to vote for acquittal. He said the eight women on the jury were \u201cmonolithic\u201d at the outset in their certainty that the defendants were guilty. But over time, \u201cthey began to change their position,\u201d he said, with one urging the other jurors to research the case on the Internet, which is a violation of court rules.\nAs the trial drew to a close, he said, there was a \u201ckind of crystallization.\u201d One of the women approached Mr. Rybin with what she said was inside information: her next-door neighbor, a former prosecutor, had told her the defendants were innocent. The next day she returned to him, he said, saying her contact had told her to spread the word: listen carefully to the defense.\nMr. Rybin was convinced that the defendants were guilty; in one of the crimes the jury was considering, a robbery, one of the men had dropped a piece of identification as he fled the scene, and the victim had made a positive identification. The night before the verdict, Mr. Rybin said, he was too nervous to sleep.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI had the feeling, \u2018Tomorrow I will take part in something dirty.\u2019 \u201d\nOn the day of the verdict, Mr. Rybin said, he thought he could find a way to stop the trial by withdrawing from the jury. But after a full day with the other jurors, feeling \u201ca bit like herring in a jar,\u201d they were forced to vote, he said. The eight women voted for acquittal, enough to make up the majority of the 12-member jury that is required here for a verdict.\nFor the next few days, while other Russians celebrated Victory Day, Mr. Rybin sat in solitude, \u201cshattered,\u201d he said.\nHe wrote an exhaustive letter to the prosecutor, marshalling evidence to show that the jury had been tainted.\nMr. Korotkov, whose client was acquitted by that vote, calls those accusations nonsense.\n\u201cJurors are ordinary Russian citizens,\u201d Mr. Korotkov said. \u201cAs far as I understand, the prosecutor\u2019s job is to convince them. To complain that the jurors are bad, or so forth, is of no use. We have a saying, \u2018Complain to the mirror.\u2019 You have to collect the evidence and present it. If there is no proof, the jurors have nothing to do with that.\u201d\nThe question is moot anyway. By the time the Supreme Court overturned the verdict and called for a new trial, in November 2006, Mr. Dukuzov had disappeared.\n\u201cHe does not trust the Russian justice system, and he is simply afraid,\u201d said Mr. Korotkov, who no longer represents him. \u201cI think he has grounds to be afraid that the trial would not be fair. For that reason, he is in hiding.\u201d\nLast week, Mr. Rybin gave his notebooks to Mr. Klebnikov\u2019s wife, Musa, who was in Moscow for the anniversary ceremony. She carried them in her handbag as she prepared to return to the United States, calling Mr. Rybin a \u201cbrave and principled person,\u201d someone her husband would have admired.\nAfter the \u201ccrushing disappointment\u201d of the trial, she is gathering her strength to push for a second one.\n\u201cEventually the whole story will come out,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever the story is.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/world/europe/12klebnikov.html", "title": "Murder Highlights Russian System\u2019s Flaws", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}

{"date": "Wed, 18 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LVIV, Ukraine \u2014 It is not immediately clear why Vasily V. Humenyuk should be a candidate for president of Ukraine. A former customs official from the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, he subscribes to no particular ideology, has the flimsiest of platforms and does not plan to tour the country before the vote, reasoning that \u201cthese trips cost a great deal and the people are sick of them.\u201d\nIn fact, he could have vanished into this winter\u2019s overpopulated presidential race had he not, on Oct. 2, legally changed his last name to \u201cProtyvsikh,\u201d Ukrainian for \u201cAgainst Everyone.\u201d\nThough few see Mr. Protyvsikh as a serious candidate, he reflects the sour mood that has swelled in the electorate \u2014 and one that could swing a pivotal presidential election in January.\nFor years, the vote in Ukraine has been almost evenly divided between the industrial Russian-speaking east of the country, whose voters generally favor closer ties with Moscow, and westerners intent on pursuing a European path. The current field of 18 candidates is almost certain to narrow for a closely fought second round of voting between these two constituencies, in the form of former Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich, from the east, and the current prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko.\nBut while Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s voters have the incentive of reclaiming Kiev, deep disillusionment has settled in the west, home of the Orange Revolution. It is not yet clear whether that feeling runs so deep that voters will stay home, or \u2014 as Mr. Protyvsikh clearly hopes \u2014 go out of their way to cast a protest vote.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s disappointed in politicians,\u201d said Vladimir Zuyenko, 44, a security guard who said he had gone three months without pay. \u201cThey made this revolution, but they didn\u2019t solve anything. We were poor then, and we\u2019re still poor. The only reason to vote is that if we don\u2019t, someone else will vote for us.\u201d\nFive years ago, euphoria surged through this city, the first in Ukraine to declare Viktor A. Yushchenko president, on the eve of the Orange Revolution. So many people piled onto buses headed for Kiev to support the pro-Western coalition that streets were left half-empty, and those who stayed wore bits of orange in solidarity. Viktoria Gnip, 35, said she was so inspired that she vowed on the spot to name her unborn baby Yulia or Viktor, after the two heroes of the day.\nEven recalling that happiness seems painful in Lviv (pronounced luh-VEEV) these days. Voters complain about the bitter public infighting between Mr. Yushchenko and Ms. Tymoshenko, about cronyism in local appointments, about an underfinanced health care system and about an economy so miserable that doctors and teachers leave for menial jobs in western Europe.\n\u201cPeople had hope then,\u201d Darya Lobachevskaya, 63, said. \u201cIt lasted for a year, maybe two years. But then, wherever it came from, it went back there.\u201d\nAs this mood has deepened, the proportion of Ukrainians who tell pollsters they will vote for \u201cnone of the above\u201d \u2014 one option on the ballot \u2014 has been edging up, from 4 percent in 2004 to around 8 percent now, said Oleksiy Antypovych, of the polling organization Rating, who works out of Kiev and Lviv. By the time voters go to the polls, that percentage drops by one-half, so it has never proved decisive in an election, he said.\nBut the \u201cnone of the above\u201d votes are much higher when respondents are asked about the second round of this winter\u2019s election, with 18 percent answering that they would not vote for either Mr. Yanukovich or Ms. Tymoshenko. Even if half of that group ends up staying home or making a choice between the candidates, up to 10 percent of Ukrainians may vote for \u201cnone of the above,\u201d Mr. Antypovych said.\n\u201cThat would set a precedent,\u201d he said.\nThe protest vote, in this case, could be decisive. Current data shows that 40 percent of voters would back Mr. Yanukovich in a second round, and 30 percent would back Ms. Tymoshenko, Mr. Antypovych said. Though Ms. Tymoshenko is likely to pick up many Orange votes from four first-round candidates with similar platforms \u2014 among them Mr. Yushchenko \u2014 it is not yet clear if the old coalition will rally around her when she most needs it. Or what will happen if the results are disputed.\n\u201cOne thing I can say with certainty: There will be no repetition of that revolution,\u201d Mr. Antypovych said. \u201cPeople will no longer go out into the streets for a politician. They simply will not go out. Based on our surveys, most voters expect there to be mass falsification. They are already accustomed to the idea.\u201d\nIt was against this backdrop that Mr. Protyvsikh, 63, began his quixotic campaign.\nIn his handful of public appearances, he has stuck closely to his simple slogan, explaining that he does not subscribe to any particular ideology (\u201cElect me, and then I\u2019ll explain everything,\u201d he added, reassuringly). Amid speculation that he was injected into the race to sabotage another candidate, he said his financing came from \u201cmy friends, who are scattered all over the world, rich ones, my relatives, my fellow villagers.\u201d\nMostly, he answers questions about his last name. \u201cI made this decision six months ago, because I had reached the end of my patience,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cI will stand in the breach. I am brave, I am independent. I changed my name to express the will of all the people \u2014 many, many in Ukraine \u2014 who are against everyone.\u201d\nAndrei Mikitin, a journalist from Mr. Protyvsikh\u2019s home town of Ivano-Frankivsk, said the \u201cAgainst Everyone\u201d campaign has provoked mostly chuckles at home. When push comes to shove, he said, however disappointed western Ukrainians are in the Orange leadership, they will be roused by the desire to vote against Mr. Yanukovich, if only because Moscow backs him.\n\u201cYou have to understand people here,\u201d said Mr. Mikitin, editor in chief of the newspaper Western Ukraine. \u201cPeople don\u2019t need \u2018Against Everyone.\u2019 They need an \u2018Against Russia.\u2019 Or an \u2018Against Putin.\u2019 That\u2019s what I would have advised him, if he had asked me.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/world/europe/19ukraine.html", "title": "In Ukraine, \u201904 Euphoria Has Turned to Despair", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}

Mr. Calder\u00f3n later visited two hospitals in Hermosillo and spoke with several children who were recovering.\nThe scene at the ABC day care center was chilling, with charred baby clothes, blackened bassinets and toys littering the sidewalk. Holes had been punched through the wall of the center to evacuate the children, and a frantic caravan of ambulances and cars had shuttled the children, who ranged in age from 6 months to 5 years, to the hospital.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s God?\u201d a police officer who participated in the rescue cried out in tears, according to a radio report. Neighbors pitched in to save as many children as they could after teachers ran from the smoke-filled center to sound the alarm.\n\u201cWe passed their little bodies from one of us to the next to get them out,\u201d Roberto Bustamante, a neighbor, told the newspaper Reforma.\nGov. Eduardo Bours of Sonora said 142 babies, toddlers and young children were being watched over by six employees when the fire broke out about 3 p.m., the news media reported.\nMr. Calder\u00f3n ordered the government to assist the families of those who died, and he called on the attorney general to find the cause of the fire. It was believed to have started at a nearby store or tire depot and then to have spread to the day care center, which provided services for the Mexican Social Security Institute in a working-class neighborhood.\nPolitical parties said they would suspend campaigning for elections in July. With only about half of the victims identified by Saturday morning and a number of survivors admitted with injuries, parents sat outside hospitals awaiting word on the fate of their children. The toll continued to rise through the day.\nQuestions were already being raised about whether the deaths could have been prevented. Some news reports said the center lacked working emergency exits.\nGovernor Bours said 20 children remained in critical condition and that 80 of the 142 had gone home. Among the 20 in critical condition is a 3-year-old girl named Alejandra who has burns over 80 percent of her body. Some of the most severe burn victims were being sent to Shriners Hospital for Children in Sacramento, he said.\n\u201cThis was an enormous, painful tragedy,\u201d Mr. Bours said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/world/americas/07mexico.html", "title": "Mexico Vows to Investigate Day Care Fire", "author": "MARC LACEY"}
{"date": "Mon, 10 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The surveillance cameras captured it all: guards looking on nonchalantly as 53 inmates \u2014 many of them associated with one of Mexico\u2019s most notorious drug cartels \u2014 let themselves out of their cells and sped off in waiting vehicles.\nThe video shows that prison guards only pulled out their weapons after the inmates were well on their way. The brazen escape in May in the northern state of Zacatecas \u2014 carried out in minutes without a single shot fired \u2014 is just one of many glaring examples of how Mexico\u2019s crowded and cruel prison system represents a critical weak link in the drug war.\nMexico\u2019s prisons, as described by inmates and insiders and viewed during several visits, are places where drug traffickers find a new base of operations for their criminal empires, recruit underlings, and bribe their way out for the right price. The system is so flawed, in fact, that the Mexican government is extraditing record numbers of drug traffickers to the United States, where they find it much harder to intimidate witnesses, run their drug operations or escape.\nThe latest jailbreak took place this weekend, when a suspected drug trafficker vanished from a Sinaloa prison during a party for inmates featuring a Mexican country music band. The Mexican government is considering isolating drug offenders from regular inmates to reduce opportunities for abuse.\nThe United States government, as part of its counternarcotics assistance program, is committing $4 million this year to help fix Mexico\u2019s broken prisons, officials said. Experts from state prisons in the United States have begun tutorials for Mexican guards to make sure that there are clear ethical guidelines and professional practices that distinguish them from the men and women they guard. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in rounding all these characters up if they are going to get out on their own,\u201d said an American official involved in the training, who was not authorized to speak on the record.\nAlthough Mexican prisons call themselves Centers for Social Rehabilitation, \u201cUniversities of crime would be a better name,\u201d said Pedro H\u00e9ctor Arellano, who runs the prison outreach program in Mexico for the Episcopal Church.\nMexico\u2019s prisons are bursting at the seams, with space for 172,151 inmates nationwide but an additional 50,000 crammed in. More arrive by the day as part of the government\u2019s drug war, which has sent tens of thousands to prison since President Felipe Calder\u00f3n took office nearly three years ago.\nInside the high concrete walls ringed by barbed wire, past the heavily armed men in black uniforms with stern expressions, inmates rule the roost. Some well-heeled prisoners pay to have keys to their cells. When life inside, with its pizza deliveries, prostitutes and binges on drugs and alcohol, becomes too confining, prisoners sometimes pay off the guards for a furlough or an outright jailbreak.\n\u201cOur prisons are businesses more than anything else,\u201d said Pedro Arellano Aguilar, an expert on prisons. He has visited scores of them in Mexico and has come away with a dire view of what takes place inside. \u201cEverything is for sale and everything can be bought.\u201d\nGuards Work for Inmates\nFor drug lords, flush with money, life on the inside is often a continuation of the free-spirited existence they led outside. Inmates look up to them. Guards often become their employees.\nFor more than a decade, Enrique, a strapping man with a faraway look in his eyes, worked in one of the roughest prisons in Mexico, imposing his will. He assigned prisoners to cell blocks based on the size of the bribes they made. He punished those who stepped out of line.\n\u201cI was the boss,\u201d he declared. Not exactly. Enrique, whose story was corroborated by a prisoner advocates\u2019 group, was actually an inmate, serving time inside Reclusorio Preventivo Oriente prison in Mexico City for trafficking cocaine. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t work the way it does,\u201d said Enrique, now released, who asked that his full name not be published so he can resume life after his 12-year sentence.\nMiguel Caro Quintero, a major drug trafficker wanted in Arizona and Colorado on charges of supplying multi-ton shipments of marijuana and cocaine to the United States, was jailed for 10 years in Mexico. Federal prosecutors accused him, like many drug lords, of continuing illegal activities from behind bars, using smuggled cellphones to maintain contact with his underlings on the outside and recruiting prisoners who were nearing the end of their sentences.\nWhen his sentence in Mexico was up, he was sent off to the United States to face charges there, becoming one of more than 50 Mexicans, most of them drug offenders, extradited this year.\n\u201cWhen we keep a criminal in a Mexican prison, we run the risk that one way or another they are going to keep in contact with their criminal network,\u201d Leopoldo Velarde, who heads extraditions for the federal attorney general\u2019s office, said. \u201cThe idea is to stop criminals, not just jail them.\u201d\nLife in Reclusorio Preventivo Oriente prison\u2019s Dormitory No. 9, where many top drug traffickers are held, shows the clout that influential inmates enjoy. The prisoners are a privileged lot, wearing designer clothing and enjoying special privileges ranging from frequent visits by girlfriends to big-screen televisions in their spacious cells, federal prosecutors told local newspapers after one of the inmates recently bought his way out.\nTraffickers continue to run their operations through their lieutenants inside the prison as well as outside, using supposedly banned cellphones.\nThe government says it is moving aggressively to ship off dangerous criminals who are wanted in the United States and are likely to restart their criminal enterprises from jail. Once the legal requirements are met by both governments, the handcuffed suspects are flown by American government agencies to face trial in the United States. Usually the country that requests extradition pays expenses, but American officials said that who pays depends on individual cases.\nSince Mr. Calder\u00f3n came to office in December 2006, his government has surprised the United States by extraditing more than 200 criminal suspects, more than double the rate of predecessors. Based on the legal battles they begin to avoid extradition, it is clear that inmates fear going to the United States. Their support network, prison officials in both countries say, is considerably weaker there.\nFor years, the Justice Department lobbied Mexico to allow more criminal suspects to face trial in the United States. But until 2005, Mexican court rulings limited extradition to those cases in which neither the death penalty nor life in prison was sought, and Mexican pride about sovereignty made Mexican officials drag their feet. That changed with Mr. Calder\u00f3n\u2019s resolve to embark on a tougher drug war.\nAmerican officials say they are thrilled with the Mexicans\u2019 more aggressive extradition policy. \u201cThe best way to disrupt and dismantle a criminal organization is to lock up its leaders and seize their money \u2014 so we will work with our Mexican counterparts to locate and extradite, when appropriate, cartel leadership to the United States for prosecution,\u201d Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in July.\nA Wave of Escapes\nThe jailbreak in May at the Cieneguillas prison in Zacatecas was just one of several escapes that showed how porous Mexican jails are. The Zetas, a paramilitary group known for its ruthlessness in protecting its drug turf, planned the escape, and have organized jailbreaks in at least four states, Mexican law enforcement officials said. Zacatecas prison has had at least three escapes in recent years.\nThe situation there is so bad, according to a local lawyer, Uriel M\u00e1rquez Valerio, that inmates managed to invite a musical group into the prison in 2005 to celebrate the birthday of a drug trafficker, who several weeks later found a way to escape.\nIn recent weeks, the authorities have managed to catch three of the 53 escapees from May and have thrown 51 prison officials, including the director, into jail while the investigation into collusion in the escape continues. The prime piece of evidence against the prison employees was the surveillance system they were supposed to use to monitor inmates. The video, leaked by law enforcement officials and now available on YouTube, recorded the jailbreak in detail.\nIt was clearly an inside job, one that prompted Interpol to issue an international alert for 11 of the escapees, who were deemed \u201ca risk to the safety and security of citizens around the world.\u201d\nOne of the escapees, Osvaldo Garc\u00eda Delgado, a 27-year-old trafficker with the nickname Vampire, said after he had been re-arrested that the Zetas planned the breakout. Carefully plotted for weeks, the operation was designed to release some top Zeta commanders. Scores of lower-level Zetas were taken along as well.\nThe Vampire told police interrogators that the prisoners were awakened early one morning and told to dress in their best clothes. He expressed surprise that the guards were doing no guarding that day but instead had become instrumental players in the escape plan.\nThe men carrying out the escape were dressed in federal police uniforms and drove what appeared to be police vehicles, with lights, sirens and official-looking decals affixed to the sides. There was a helicopter flying overhead as well, giving the operation the air of legitimacy. Since drug cartels frequently recruit law enforcement officials as allies, it is never clear in Mexico whether they will in fact enforce the law \u2014 or whether they are impostors.\nIn this case, the authorities later disclosed that the uniforms worn by the gunmen who carried out the escape were either outright fakes or outdated outfits. The vehicles, which screeched away from the scene with sirens blaring, were not actual police-issue either, the authorities said. All that said, investigators have not ruled out the possibility that corrupt law enforcement officials helped carry out the operation.\nAfter the latest escape, federal authorities have begun interviewing prison workers to determine how Orso Iv\u00e1n Gast\u00e9lum Cruz, who was arrested by the army in 2005, disappeared Sunday from jail in Sinaloa, where one of Mexico\u2019s major drug cartels is based.\nLast July, Luis Gonzaga Castro Flores, a trafficker working for the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, bought his way out of Reclusorio Preventivo Oriente prison, where he was described by the local media as the godfather of Dormitory No. 9, the area where many drug prisoners are kept.\nOther detainees escape before ever getting to prison or while being transferred to court, often with the aid of their cartel colleagues as well as complicit guards. In March, an armed group opened fire on a police convoy outside Mexico City, freeing five drug traffickers who were being taken to prison.\nThe government acknowledges it does not have full control of its prisons, but it attributes part of the problem to its aggressive roundup of drug traffickers. Escapes are on the rise, a top federal law enforcement official, Luis C\u00e1rdenas Palomino, told reporters recently, because the government was locking up so many leading operatives that it was getting harder for the cartels to function.\nA Space Crunch\nMexico\u2019s prison system is a mishmash of federal, state and local facilities of varying quality. The most dangerous prisoners are supposed to be housed in maximum security federal facilities, but there is nowhere near enough space. So the federal government pays the states to take in drug traffickers and other federal prisoners in their far less secure lockups.\nFrom August through December 2008, in the most recent statistics available, state prisons across Mexico reported 36 violent episodes with 80 deaths, 162 injuries and 27 escapes, the government said. There was no breakdown in those statistics of how much of the violence was linked to traffickers, but experts said prisoners involved in the drug trade tend to be the most fierce and trouble-prone of all.\n\u201cThese are clear signals that the penal system, as it is currently organized, is not meeting its primary obligation of guarding inmates efficiently and safely while they serve their sentences,\u201d the federal government\u2019s recently released strategic plan on prisons said of the string of assaults and escapes.\nTo relieve the congestion and better control the inmates, the government is planning a prison-building spree that will add tens of thousands of new beds in the coming years. One goal, officials say, is to keep drug lords separate from petty criminals as well as the many people who have been imprisoned but never convicted, thus reducing their ability to recruit new employees.\nThe government is also focusing on personnel, boosting guards\u2019 pay, putting them through a newly created training academy and screening them for corruption. Mexico recently sent several dozen of its guards to beef up their skills at the training academy used by the New Mexico Department of Corrections.\nAll of the trainees, even guards with 15 years\u2019 experience, had to start with the basics, shining their boots, cleaning out dormitory toilets and listening to lectures on how conniving inmates can be in trying to win over weak-willed guards.\nSome of those Mexican guards who are now active participants in Mexico\u2019s deeply flawed penal system say they welcome the moves toward professionalism.\nOne prison guard acknowledged, \u201cWe have guns, but we know it is them, not us, who really control things.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/americas/11prisons.html", "title": "Mexico\u2019s Drug Traffickers Continue Trade in Prison", "author": "MARC LACEY"}

Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Stephen Smith, said at a news conference on Wednesday that the executive, Stern Hu, an Australian citizen and general manager of Rio Tinto\u2019s iron ore business in China, could face espionage charges. He said three other Rio Tinto employees detained Sunday in Shanghai were Chinese citizens, who are more vulnerable to severe penalties, including the death penalty.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Rio Tinto, an Australian-British company, said: \u201cWe have been advised by the Australian government of this surprising allegation. We are not aware of any evidence that would support such an investigation.\u201d\nMr. Smith said he did not believe that the case was related to commercial matters, or to Rio Tinto\u2019s decision last month to scrap a planned $19.5 billion investment in the mining company by Chinalco, a state-owned Chinese company.\nBut analysts called the timing of the case peculiar; friction has been growing between officials in China and Australia over huge investments China has sought to make this year in Australian mining and resource companies. And Chinese steel mills are negotiating tensely with Australian iron ore producers, led by Rio Tinto, to seek price reductions.\n\u201cThis could cast a chill over the business environment in China,\u201d John Frankenstein, an associate professor of economics at Brooklyn College and a specialist in China trade, said Wednesday. \u201cPeople may say: \u2018Do we really want to get involved in high-stakes negotiations where China\u2019s national interests are involved? If things don\u2019t go right, people might retaliate.\u2019 \u201d\nThe scrapped Chinalco-Rio Tinto deal, which would have effectively expanded Chinalco\u2019s stake in Rio to 18.5 percent from 9.3 percent, drew stiff political opposition in Australia, where mineral riches have fueled prosperity and some residents have begun to fear China\u2019s regional power.\nCharges and countercharges of espionage between China and Australia have further turned public opinion in both countries against the deal. Last April, Australian newspaper articles said Chinese intelligence agents tried to hack into Prime Minister Kevin Rudd\u2019s phone and e-mail when he was in Beijing for the Olympics in August, creating an uproar among Australian politicians and leading to calls for greater communications security. The news reports, citing unidentified Australian intelligence agents as sources, also said agents working for China had tried to hack into systems run by Rio Tinto.\nChina denied the reports, Mr. Rudd played them down in his comments, and the Australian government never released a statement confirming them.\nAfter the Chinalco deal fell apart, Rio Tinto raised money through existing shareholders and a joint venture with BHP Billiton, another British-Australian mining giant. Chinese officials then complained that Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton could have near-monopoly power in some resources and that China could oppose the deal on antitrust terms.\nOn the Web site of Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, Shanghai Securities News reported Wednesday that the case could also involve commercial bribery.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/asia/09riotinto.html", "title": "China Detains Mining Executive on Spy Charge, Australia says", "author": "DAVID BARBOZA"}

It was also possible, however, that the Taliban would not follow through on their threats.\nOn Thursday morning in Kandahar, a city in the south, a few small rockets landed just before polls opened, according to Reuters, and security officials said four people were injured.\nAfghan, American and other allied officials are hoping a successful vote will show movement toward stability. The Obama administration has sent thousands more American troops here this year to help secure the nation before the election.\nThe Afghan government announced Wednesday that it had managed to secure enough districts to allow voting to go ahead in roughly 6,600 polling centers \u2014 more than in the previous election in 2004.\nBut the extent of the areas affected by insecurity, especially in southern Afghanistan, had become clearer as the election drew near. The election commission said it still had to deliver election materials to four districts around the country and would have to use helicopters because the roads were too unsafe.\nUnlike the last election, in 2004, Afghans will do most poll monitoring themselves on Thursday. Election monitors said they would be able to cover more than 60 percent of districts.\nYet Ahmad Nader Nadery, head of the largest independent Afghan monitor mission, the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan, acknowledged concerns that there would be no monitors in some of the most insecure districts where intimidation and fraud were most likely to occur. Instead, candidates\u2019 representatives will be the only check on fraud in those areas.\nMr. Karzai had appeared on state television and called on people to vote despite Taliban threats, saying the security forces would ensure their safety. The announcement drew criticism from the election commission for breaking a campaign blackout during the last 48 hours before the vote, but it was an indication of how concerned the government is about low turnout.\nMr. Karzai made another appeal Thursday as he showed up to vote, The Associated Press reported. \u201cI request from the Afghan people to come out and vote so through their vote Afghanistan will be more secure, more peaceful,\u201d he said.\nTwo months ago, Mr. Karzai seemed to dominate the field as the only apparent choice for Afghans, even though his popularity slipped with criticism of deteriorating security, corruption and a lack of jobs.\nBut Mr. Abdullah, a former foreign minister and eye doctor who is running for the main opposition movement, the United Front, has since managed to tap a widespread hunger for change, especially in the north.\nLive televised debates, which also included a former finance minister, Ashraf Ghani, and a former minister of planning, Ramazan Bashardost, were heard and watched by millions, engaging Afghans in the election process even as the Taliban escalated threats and attacks.\nIn a late development, local Taliban leaders agreed to allow people in Wardak Province, just south of Kabul, to vote unmolested, a government minister said. He asked not to be named because of the political nature of the information. The minister said he believed that the Taliban would allow the vote to go ahead in the south, despite their threats.\nYet he also expressed concern that one devastating suicide bombing could deter voters across the country.\nAt three polling stations in west Kabul early Thursday, turnout was lower than in the 2004 presidential election.\nAt one, Mitra Hemat, 24, an election worker, said the turnout was significantly down. \u201cThere are very few people. People are afraid, I can tell.\u201d\nIt is unclear whether the numbers were as low across the city, or whether voters were waiting to judge the streets were safe before coming out later in the day.\nAllies of Mr. Karzai said they thought he could still win in the first round, with over 50 percent of ballots.\nDespite gains by his opponents, Mr. Karzai fought back hard in the last two weeks, making selective campaign stops and securing the return of a former Uzbek warlord, Abdul Rashid Dostum, from exile. The Uzbek leader has been widely criticized for past human rights abuses, and opponents and Western diplomats have condemned the president\u2019s association with him as an example of the unsavory alliances Mr. Karzai has made to try to secure his re-election.\nMr. Dostum may prove critical, however, in plugging a hole in Mr. Karzai\u2019s support by bringing the ethnic Uzbek vote in the north to his side. Even Mr. Abdullah\u2019s supporters conceded that Mr. Dostum\u2019s return was a blow, one insider said.\nOn Wednesday three Taliban gunmen seized control of a bank in Kabul and engaged the police in a two-hour gun battle. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack after the three gunmen had been killed by the police.\nElection officials reported that six election workers had been killed Tuesday in roadside bombings.\n\u201cWe have mixed feelings,\u201d said Mr. Nadery, director of the Afghan election monitoring organization.\n\u201cOn the one hand, there is this excitement and the feeling that we are moving on. The 2004 presidential election was an event and now we are turning it into a process. It is not full democracy but it is bringing us to a different way of politics that is not through violence,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut of course we have the increased level of intimidation,\u201d he added. \u201cThis transition is costly and that worries us.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/world/asia/20afghan.html", "title": "As Afghan Polls Open, Contest for Presidency Tightens", "author": "CARLOTTA GALL"}
{"date": "Tue, 17 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ROME \u2014 A Milan court on Tuesday handed down a ruling that would send the political establishments of many countries into a tailspin. It found the British lawyer David Mills guilty of taking $600,000 in exchange for lying to protect the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi.\nIn Italy, the ruling did not even lead the evening news.\nThat honor went to Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s main political rival, Walter Veltroni, who stepped down on Tuesday after his party\u2019s solid defeat on Monday in the election for governor of Sardinia, where the Democratic Party incumbent lost to the son of Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s tax lawyer. So the story of the day was not of corruption but of Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s ever-expanding grip on power in Italy.\nMr. Mills said he would appeal the decision. \u201cI am innocent, but this is a highly political case,\u201d he said in a statement.\nIndeed, Mr. Berlusconi was a co-defendant until last year, when he pushed through Parliament a law granting top officials, notably him, immunity from prosecution while in office.\nYet in the topsy-turvy logic of Italian politics, the ruling seemed less a defeat for Mr. Mills than still another victory for Mr. Berlusconi, who in 15 years of dominating Italian political life has managed to turn every legal setback into political capital.\nA billionaire who owns Italy\u2019s largest private media empire, Mr. Berlusconi has been repeatedly convicted of corruption, only to see the charges overturned on appeal or wither when statutes of limitations lapsed. He has pleaded not guilty in each case. The more Mr. Berlusconi works the system to his advantage, the more Italians seem to admire him.\n\u201cThere is a part of Italian society that thinks it is scandalous that there is a prime minister who has faced so many charges, who has huge conflicts of interest,\u201d said Sergio Romano, a columnist for the newspaper Corriere della Sera. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a minority, but it is quite vocal.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cI think that the real question we should ask is why there is a part of Italian society that isn\u2019t scandalized?\u201d\nMost Italians can barely keep Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s many legal cases straight. It seems he barely can, either.\n\u201cI\u2019m the universal record-holder for the number of trials in the entire history of man \u2014 and also of other creatures who live on other planets,\u201d he said last year.\nRoberto D\u2019Alimonte, a political science professor at the University of Florence, said: \u201cThe only people who care is the anti-Berlusconi minority. Public opinion doesn\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s part of the Berlusconi phenomenon.\u201d\nThere is also a kind of Catholic realpolitik, in which human beings are understood to be fallen.\nAlexander Stille, the author of \u201cThe Sack of Rome,\u201d a critical account of the rise of Mr. Berlusconi, said most Italians have \u201ctalked themselves into the point of view that politics is a dirty business, that everyone has skeletons in the closet, judges have paid more attention to Berlusconi than to most people, therefore they found more skeletons.\u201d\nMr. Berlusconi entered politics in 1994, in the wake of a bribery scandal in which a third of the Parliament came under indictment. The judiciary was then seen as an admirable branch of government.\nBut over the years, he has managed to transform public perceptions of the judiciary with his relentless accusations that they are left-wing ideologues unjustly singling him out.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a part of the country that fears the left; they are afraid of the left, and Berlusconi preys on those fears,\u201d Mr. Romano said.\nIn December, prosecutors accused Mr. Mills of taking money in 2000 in exchange for providing false testimony in trials in 1997 and 1998 relating to offshore companies that Mr. Mills helped set up in the 1990s for Fininvest, Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s holding company.\nProsecutors said Mr. Mills failed to tell a court that two offshore companies involved in buying United States film rights had links to Mr. Berlusconi, The Associated Press reported. They also said Mr. Mills failed to mention a 1995 telephone call with Mr. Berlusconi in which the two discussed what were said to be illicit payments from Mr. Berlusconi to the Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, who died in 2000.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Mills was given a four-and-a-half-year sentence, but it is unlikely that he will serve jail time. Under Italian law, prison terms begin only after a definitive ruling. It is also unlikely that the two more rounds of appeals that are possible will end before 2010 \u2014 when the 10-year statute of limitations in such cases is up. Similarly, if Mr. Berlusconi stays in office until then, the case against him will die, too.\nProsecutors in Milan began investigating Mr. Mills in 2004 after a tip from authorities in London, where Mr. Mills\u2019s tax accountant had come forward with concerns about potential improper use of money.\nIn 2004, Mr. Mills wrote to his accountant, Bob Drennan, about the tax status of a payment from associates of Mr. Berlusconi. In a letter to Mr. Drennan, Mr. Mills wrote, \u201cI told no lies, but I turned some very tricky corners, to put it mildly, and so kept Mr. B. out of a great deal of trouble he would have been in had I said all I knew,\u201d according to a widely published copy of the letter.\nIn exchange for his testimony, he said, he received money that he \u201ccould treat as a long term loan or a gift.\u201d\nIn July 2004, Mr. Mills told prosecutors in Milan that the letter was accurate, and that he had received $600,000 from associates of Mr. Berlusconi in recognition for providing favorable testimony. Later Mr. Mills retracted his statement.\nMr. Mills is the estranged husband of the British Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, who in a statement issued by her office on Tuesday said, \u201cThis is a terrible blow to David and although we are separated I have never doubted his innocence.\u201d\nThe prosecutor in the Mills trial, Fabio de Pasquale, has challenged the legality of the law granting Mr. Berlusconi and Italy\u2019s highest elected officials immunity. The Constitutional Court of Italy has not yet ruled on the matter.\nNews reports in the fall said Mr. Berlusconi was considering nominating Niccol\u00f2 Ghedini, his own lawyer, to fill a vacancy on the Constitutional Court.\nIn an interview last fall, Mr. Ghedini said that was unlikely, but not because of his involvement in the prime minister\u2019s legal cases.\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said then. \u201cBecause I like being a lawyer. I\u2019d never want to be a judge.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/world/europe/18italy.html", "title": "Italy Finds Lawyer Guilty of Taking a Bribe in Exchange for Protecting the Premier", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}
{"date": "Mon, 26 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "GAZA \u2014 The bank executive sits in a suit and tie behind his broad empty desk with plenty of time to talk. Almost no loans are being issued or corporate plans made. The Texas-trained engineer closed his firm because nothing is being built. The business student who dreamed of attending an American university \u2014 filling a computer file with meticulous hopes and plans \u2014 has stopped dreaming. He goes from school to a part-time job to home, where he joins his merchant father who sits unemployed.\nTen months after the Israeli military said it invaded this Palestinian coastal strip to stop the daily rocket fire of its Islamist rulers, there are many ways to measure the misery of Gaza.\nBits of rubble are being cleared, but nothing is going up. Several thousand homes remain destroyed. Several dozen families still live in United Nations tents strung amid their ruined houses. A three-year-old embargo on Hamas imposed by Israel and Egypt keeps nearly all factories shut and supplies away. Eighty percent of the population gets some form of assistance.\nBut the misery of the educated and professional class has a particular poignancy. Many abroad view Gaza as a large slum, yet there is near universal literacy here and infant mortality is low by regional standards. Midsize glass towers gleam. Many thousands have advanced degrees. Half a dozen stylish restaurants fill each day with young women \u2014 a few with heads uncovered \u2014 carrying laptop computers, and with the underemployed, who smoke hookahs and lament their future.\n\u201cWe are entering very dark years,\u201d remarked Slama Bissiso, vice chairman of the Palestinian Bar Association, slowly exhaling scented tobacco smoke on the balcony of the Deira Hotel overlooking the Mediterranean. He said that the embargo on Gaza and the divide between the Hamas government here and the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority in the West Bank were driving Gaza into deeper isolation every month.\nMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, announced on Friday that elections would be held in January. But it was effectively an announcement that Fatah and Hamas had failed to reconcile their differences despite Egyptian mediation. There will be no election here without the agreement of Hamas, and it has no intention of granting it now. If that means a vote will be held in the West Bank only, the horizons of Gaza will retreat even further.\nHamas\u2019s control of Gaza feels solidly unchallenged. Its security forces patrol the streets. Pictures of President Abbas with big X\u2019s across his face line the main avenue, sadly known as Unity Street. A new sign on the Gaza side of the Israeli border bars even foreigners from bringing in alcohol.\nLeft out of the banking system, Hamas affiliates opened their own bank recently. In keeping with Muslim strictures, it does not charge interest or offer loans, making money by buying cars or homes the customer wants, then reselling them at a higher price.\nIsrael allows about 100 trucks a day to pass into Gaza bearing food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. But it has closed off commerce in the hope of alienating the population here from their rulers. That seems to be happening. Yet if no election occurs, it is hard to see how the alienation can be expressed or government changed.\nIsrael wants to isolate Hamas because the group rejects Israel\u2019s existence. As Ayman Taha, a Hamas movement spokesman, said in an interview, \u201cOur long-term strategy is the liberation of all of Palestine, but we would agree to a temporary solution involving a state in the 1967 borders with a truce of about 10 years, depending on the conditions of the truce.\u201d\nEgypt rejects Hamas because of its affiliation with the Cairo-based Muslim Brotherhood. Both Egypt and Israel worry about Iranian arming of the group as well.\nThe increasing isolation of Gaza is taking its toll. Opportunities for training and education abroad or for outsiders to come here, for example, are scarce. The children\u2019s library in the center of the city could not persuade either Israeli or Egyptian officials to let anyone in to help set up new programs or carry out quality control.\nExecutives at Jawwal, the Palestinian cellphone company, sat last week at their work stations in blue jeans \u2014 as at the end of every work week it was Casual Thursday \u2014 and said their jobs were getting harder because spare parts and training were unavailable. Their senior managers, who used to travel abroad once a month, now cannot travel at all.\nWhile 1,100 students admitted to programs abroad did get through the crossing into Egypt over the past few months \u2014 and another 50 were granted permission through Israel \u2014 more than 800 others who had spots waiting for them were unable to leave, according to Gisha, an Israeli human rights group.\nMany of the professionals here reject Hamas\u2019s ideology, although some voted for the party in 2006 out of rage over the corruption in Fatah.\n\u201cHamas won by a slim margin, and it was because of people like me,\u201d said Mohamed, who comes from a Fatah family and works for a charity. \u201cI regret voting for them. I wanted to punish Fatah.\u201d\nLike nearly all in Gaza who spoke about politics, he asked that his identity be hidden for fear of what the government might do. The rules of political dissent remain fuzzy.\nThe Texas-trained engineer also voted for Hamas in 2006 and wishes he had not.\n\u201cIsrael is saying, \u2018Because you elected Hamas, you should have no life,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cYet people elected Hamas because of Fatah corruption. I believe in peace with Israel, but I wanted desperately to get away from the corruption. I didn\u2019t expect Hamas to win. Next time, I won\u2019t vote at all.\u201d\nWhile the legitimate economy here depends on foreign aid that provides salaries for tens of thousands to do little, the black market for high-priced goods smuggled in from Egypt through hundreds of tunnels is thriving, leading to the growth of a tunnel mafia.\nProfessionals here are frustrated that their political options are Fatah, which they still consider corrupt, and Hamas, whose ideology poses problems for them and for many foreign governments.\nSome said the rejection of Hamas by the world meant it made no sense for it to stay in power, but they had no idea how to effect a change.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the creation of a political alternative with businesspeople instead of Hamas and Fatah,\u201d said Rami Alagha, 39, manager of the Jawwal cellphone company. \u201cThe United States and the Europeans could get behind such a program. Otherwise we have no future.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/world/middleeast/27gaza.html", "title": "Opportunities Fade Amid Sense of Isolation in Gaza", "author": "ETHAN BRONNER"}
{"date": "Mon, 10 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "GUADALAJARA, Mexico \u2014 Flanked by his counterparts from Mexico and Canada, President Obama on Monday reiterated his commitment to pursuing comprehensive immigration reform, despite his packed political agenda and the staunch opposition such an initiative is likely to face.\nMr. Obama predicted that he would be successful but acknowledged the challenges, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot on my plate.\u201d He added that there would almost certainly be \u201cdemagogues out there who try to suggest that any form or pathway for legalization for those who are already in the United States is unacceptable.\u201d\nBut in the most detailed outline yet of his timetable, the president said that he expected Congress, after completing work on health care, energy and financial regulation, to draft immigration bills this year. He said he would begin work on getting the measures passed in 2010.\n\u201cNow, am I going to be able to snap my fingers and get this done? No,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut ultimately, I think the American people want fairness. And we can create a system in which you have strong border security and an orderly process for people to come in. But we\u2019re also giving an opportunity for those who are already in the United States to be able to achieve a pathway to citizenship so they don\u2019t have to live in the shadows.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s comments came during a news conference at the end of a summit meeting of North American leaders aimed at increasing cooperation in the region and resolving some of the issues that have long strained trilateral relations among the countries, whose people and economies depend heavily on one another.\nDuring the meetings, which began Sunday afternoon, Mr. Obama, President Felipe Calder\u00f3n of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada discussed climate change and clean energy, swine flu, immigration, trade and organized crime. While it was clear at the news conference that the three leaders had not reached any significant new agreements, they expressed understanding for one another\u2019s positions and vowed to keep working to resolve outstanding disputes.\nMr. Harper, for example, stood by a decision a month ago to require Mexicans to apply for visas but said that the problems were Canada\u2019s, not Mexico\u2019s. \u201cIt is simply far too easy to make a bogus refugee claim as a way of entering the country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to change that.\u201d\nA \u201cBuy American\u201d provision attached to the United States stimulus package has ignited a political storm in Canada. But on Monday, Mr. Obama played down the scope of the program, saying it was something he had grudgingly accepted to achieve the greater purpose of pumping money into America\u2019s flailing economy.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to keep this in perspective,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThis in no way has endangered the billions of dollars in trade taking place between our two countries.\u201d\nMr. Obama offered a spirited defense of Mr. Calder\u00f3n\u2019s efforts to rein in the drug cartels, a fight that has left nearly 4,200 people dead this year. Recently, Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, raised concerns about human rights abuses in the drug war, and Democratic legislators have threatened to withhold some financial support.\nAt the news conference, Mr. Obama said unequivocally that he would push for continuing America\u2019s support for the Mexican effort, adding, \u201cThe biggest, by far, violators of human rights right now are the cartels themselves that are kidnapping people, extorting people and encouraging corruption.\u201d\nMr. Calder\u00f3n issued his own passionate defense, saying, \u201cThe struggle, the battle, the fight against organized crime is precisely to preserve the human rights of Mexican people.\u201d\nThe Mexican Supreme Court supported the army on Monday by declining to take up a case pushed by human rights advocates that challenged the use of military prosecutors, instead of civilian ones, in pursuing charges against rogue soldiers.\nIf there were divisions on other issues, all three leaders seemed united in their support for Manuel Zelaya, the Honduran president who was ousted June 28 in what countries around the world have condemned as a coup.\n\u201cLet me be very clear in our belief that President Zelaya was removed from office illegally, that it was a coup and that he should return,\u201d Mr. Obama said. He dismissed as \u201chypocrisy\u201d the criticism from some in Latin America who say the United States has done too little to pressure Honduras\u2019s de facto government to return Mr. Zelaya to power \u2014 among them Mr. Zelaya himself.\n\u201cThe critics who say that the United States has not intervened enough in Honduras,\u201d he said, \u201care the same people who say that we\u2019re always intervening, and that the Yankees need to get out of Latin America.\u201d\nBecause of Mr. Zelaya\u2019s ouster, the United States has supported suspending Honduras from the Organization of American States and has cut $16.5 million in military assistance. The United States, which is Honduras\u2019s largest trading partner, has been reluctant, however, to call for tougher economic sanctions.\nCritics of Washington\u2019s approach, led by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, accuse the United States of placating the small group of Honduran elite who are among those who support Mr. Zelaya\u2019s removal. Senior administration officials have said they were concerned about destabilizing the third-poorest country in the hemisphere.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/americas/11prexy.html", "title": "Obama Sets Immigration Changes for 2010", "author": "GINGER THOMPSON and MARC LACEY"}
{"date": "Mon, 06 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KUNGHANG, South Korea \u2014 With his clean white university sweatshirt and shiny cellphone, Lee Chang-shik looks the part of a manager at a condominium development company, the job that he held until last year\u2019s financial panic \u2014 and the one he tells his friends and family he still holds.\nBut in fact, he leads a secret life. After his company went bankrupt late last year, he recently relocated to this remote fishing village to do the highest-paying work he could find in the current market: as a hand on a crab boat.\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t put crab fisherman on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d said Mr. Lee, 33, who makes the five-hour drive back to Seoul once a month to hunt for a desk job. \u201cThis work hurts my pride.\u201d\nTales of the downwardly mobile have become common during the current financial crisis, and South Korea has had more than its share since the global downturn hammered this once fast-growing export economy. But they often have a distinctly Korean twist, with former white-collar workers going into more physically demanding work or traditional kinds of manual labor that are relatively well paid here \u2014 from farming and fishing to the professional back-scrubbers who clean patrons at the nation\u2019s numerous public bathhouses.\nJust as distinctly Korean may be the lengths to which some go to hide their newly humble status.\nMr. Lee says he carefully avoids the topic of work in phone conversations with friends and his parents, and dodges invitations to meet by claiming he is too busy. He gave his name with great reluctance, and only after being assured the article would not appear in Korean.\nAnother former white-collar worker who now works on a crab boat in the same village said he could not tell family and friends, and told his wife only via e-mail after arriving here. Yet another tells his parents that he is in Japan.\nIn a competitive, status-conscious society, these and other workers say they feel intense shame doing manual work. Some also say they feel guilty working such rough jobs after years of expensive cram schools and college. And many younger workers, having grown up in an increasingly affluent nation, consider physical labor a part of the bygone, impoverished eras of their parents and grandparents.\n\u201cThese days, many South Koreans think they have the right to be white collar,\u201d said Lee Byung-hee, senior economist at the Korea Labor Institute, a government-linked research organization based in Seoul. \u201cBut their expectations hit the dark reality of this economy, where people have no choice but to go into the blue-collar work force.\u201d\nLabor experts say the number of former office workers who are moving into blue-collar jobs has increased as South Korea has suffered its worst unemployment since the 1997 Asian currency crisis. According to the National Statistical Office, the unemployment rate has risen to 3.8 percent \u2014 low by American standards, but high for this Asian economic powerhouse.\nMany of the unemployed can rely on traditional forms of economic support, like living with family. And despite the slowdown, jobs are still to be found in this prosperous society, where the neon-lit bustle of cities like Seoul has not missed a beat.\nStill, Jeong Seung-beom, whose small Seoul-based firm helps recruit workers for South Korea\u2019s fishing industry, says that this year is the busiest he has seen, even better than 1997, when white-collar workers also flooded his office.\nHe said his company, the Sea Job Placement Center, now places about 80 people a month, four times the number a year ago. Mr. Jeong said most of the new recruits were laid-off office workers or university students who could no longer afford tuition. Many of the newcomers are so woefully unprepared for the physical demands of fishing, he said, he tries to scare them during orientation sessions.\nOn a recent morning in his cramped office, six young men showed up with gym bags, ready to make the trip to Kunghang, near the nation\u2019s southwest tip. Among them was Mr. Lee, the former condominium developer.\nMr. Jeong warned them that they might get seasick or homesick, or even be injured or killed on the crab boats, which can spend 14 hours a day at sea. When he paused for questions, one man in his 20s asked if he could go home during holidays.\n\u201cCrabs don\u2019t take holidays,\u201d Mr. Jeong scoffed.\nUndaunted, all six went to Kunghang later that day.\nMr. Lee said he decided to fish because he could make about $1,700 a month, much more than he could earn in Seoul pouring lattes or busing tables. The high salaries stem from the chronic labor shortages in these occupations during the boom years when South Koreans shunned them as too dirty, leaving them to Asian migrant laborers.\nAnother allure is that many of these menial jobs seem to be recession-proof, workers and labor experts say.\nNa Deuk-won, who owns a school in Seoul that trains back-scrubbers and bathhouse masseuses, says enrollment has jumped 50 percent this year, to 180 students, because of a sudden influx of university graduates and laid-off office workers.\n\u201cEven in a recession, people need their back scrubbed,\u201d Mr. Na said.\nAt his Dongdaemun Bath Academy, students gathered in a tiled shower room to learn how to scrub naked customers with a pair of sponge mitts. One, Hyun Sung-chul, 48, said he had been supervising 50 workers as a manager at a construction company before losing his job in January.\nAt first, he said, he hid his enrollment in scrubbing school from family and friends, though he told his wife. When he finally confided about his career change to a friend, he was surprised when the friend confessed interest as well.\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018Teach me when I get fired, too!\u2019 \u201d Mr. Hyun said. \u201cI think people come into this field only when they are afraid that their livelihood is at risk.\u201d\nIn Kunghang, many of the new crab fishermen recruited by Mr. Jeong expressed regrets about their choice.\n\u201cThis is so smelly and dirty, it makes me want to vomit,\u201d Kwak Jung-ho, 33, a branch manager of a cellphone store in Seoul before it closed this year, said as he cut tangled crabs out of a net.\n\u201cIf my parents knew what I was doing now, they would pity me,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I look at the ocean and think, I should have worked harder at the cellphone store, and be a better man for my family.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/world/asia/07pride.html", "title": "With Wounded Pride, Unemployed Koreans Quietly Turn to Manual Labor", "author": "MARTIN FACKLER"}

{"date": "Thu, 19 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "Sir Nicholas Henderson, an urbane, gregarious and often flamboyant diplomat who labored to win the Reagan administration\u2019s backing for Britain\u2019s military campaign to recover the Falkland Islands and was considered by many of his peers to be one of Britain\u2019s most distinguished post-war diplomats, died on Monday in London, family members said. He was 89.\nAn Oxford-educated diplomat, he was settling into a new life in retirement in 1979 after holding ambassadorships in Poland, France and Germany, when Britain\u2019s incoming prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, named him ambassador to Washington.\nIt was an improbable choice. As opposition leader, Mrs. Thatcher had visited Sir Nicholas at the British Embassy in Paris, and the diplomat, convinced that Britain\u2019s future depended on its committing itself wholeheartedly to a role within Europe, took a sharply different view to his Euroskeptic guest. In his later years, Sir Nicholas recalled that he took an immediate liking to Mrs. Thatcher, the Conservative party leader, but disagreed with just about everything she said.\nIn Washington, Sir Nicholas and his wife, Mary, who was born in Greece and had covered that country\u2019s civil war in the late 1940s for Time and Life magazines, were quickly popular. Sir Nicholas, known to friends as Nicko, developed a wide range of powerful friends in Congress and the Carter administration, and the couple\u2019s stylish parties at the embassy residence on Massachusetts Avenue became a major social draw.\nAs ambassador, Sir Nicholas attracted attention in Washington for his combination of personal flamboyance and political insight \u2014 the latter, according to his admirers, partly a product of serving as a personal aide to four British foreign secretaries, starting with Sir Anthony Eden, whom he accompanied on a tour of Hitler\u2019s bunker in Berlin in 1945.\nSome Foreign Office critics saw affectation in his personal mannerisms, including his habit as a young man of carrying a copy of Thucydides\u2019 \u201cHistory of the Peloponnesian War\u201d in his pocket, as though he had modeled himself as a romantic, brilliant but eccentric upper-class Englishman.\nBut his Washington success was sealed by the fond relationship the Hendersons formed in 1981 with Ronald and Nancy Reagan, according to diplomats who served in Washington at the time.\nThis White House entr\u00e9e proved invaluable when Argentine forces invaded the Falklands in 1982.\nGaining support for that effort was far from assured, given the desire in the White House and the State Department to protect American ties in Latin America, and Mr. Reagan\u2019s privately expressed doubts about helping Britain regain control of the Falkands, a cluster of tiny, windswept islands with \u201c1,500 people and a few thousand sheep,\u201d as one diplomat involved in contacts with the White House recalled his saying. \u201cMany leading political and military figures in the U.S. were hostile to, and were skeptical of, our decision to retake the islands,\u201d Sir Nicholas said in his memoirs.\nSir Nicholas put his charm to work, not only in the corridors of power but also in more than 60 appearances on American television, emphasizing Britain\u2019s historic ties with the United States and arguing, somewhat dubiously, as some of his British colleagues acknowledged later, that the Falkands conflict should be seen as part of the wider cold war struggle with the Soviet Union. When the United States took Britain\u2019s side, many in London credited Sir Nicholas.\nBut in his memoirs, Sir Nicholas disavowed personal credit for the American support that many involved said later was essential to British success.

{"date": "Thu, 03 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The ruler of this city-state, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, became renowned as a developer-king, an autocratic visionary determined to build a 21st-century Xanadu in the desert despite a legion of critics who said it could not be done.\n\u201cWhat I have achieved for Dubai is just 10 percent of my vision,\u201d he would often tell visitors.\nThat vision took a beating last week after Dubai, struggling under $80 billion in debt, suddenly asked to delay interest payments for its flagship company, Dubai World, sending markets tumbling around the world. Now some analysts are wondering whether Sheik Mohammed can rescue Dubai from the excesses of his own wild ambition.\nAs the debt crisis was exploding last week, the 60-year-old sheik was casually tweeting during a tour of the British Museum \u2014 \u201cInspired by Islamic artifacts,\u201d he wrote \u2014 leading many here to ask how much he knew about Dubai\u2019s precarious finances.\nCurrent and former advisers say they think Sheik Mohammed\u2019s aides left him in the dark for several weeks or even months as Dubai\u2019s problems mounted. Hundreds of property projects have been frozen, and the Western financiers who once flocked here have fled in droves.\nMuch will depend on his handling of the crisis, from Dubai\u2019s role as a shining example of Arab economic success and stability to the emirates\u2019 federal political structure, which some also see as a model. Last week\u2019s debt bombshell has raised questions about possible tensions with Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich sister emirate that many had expected to bail out Dubai.\nSheik Mo, as expatriates often call him, has dismissed those speculations, and last month he told journalists who asked about a rift with Abu Dhabi to \u201cshut up.\u201d He waves away predictions of Dubai\u2019s collapse as envious carping.\nBut most agree that the emirate\u2019s current woes, like its spectacular rise over the past few decades, are rooted in Sheik Mohammed\u2019s own zeal to break the Arab mold and \u201covercome the impossible,\u201d as he put it in his book, \u201cMy Vision.\u201d\nThe scion of a family that has held power since 1833, he grew up in a Bedouin home made of coral where slaves cooked goat stews over an open fire and camels bellowed in the courtyard. It was his father, Sheik Rashid bin Saeed al-Maktoum, who first dreamed of putting Dubai on the map as a port and trade entrep\u00f4t. He, too, was ridiculed as crazy, but he proved the skeptics wrong.\nSheik Mohammed\u2019s own dreams for Dubai go well beyond making it into a world financial capital. He says he wants to lead an Arab renaissance that would transform the region. His model is not Las Vegas \u2014 as some visitors may think \u2014 but 10th-century C\u00f3rdoba, the Arab-ruled Spanish city that was then Europe\u2019s most enlightened. He has broken taboos by chastising Arabs who \u201csit around waiting, praising our glorious past and blaming others for our failures and problems.\u201d\nHe has had some notable successes. Compared with most other Arab countries, the Emirates federation \u2014 in which he serves as prime minister in addition to his role as Dubai\u2019s ruler \u2014 is a gleaming model of safety, opulence and multicultural openness. Sheik Mohammed has struggled to foster a culture of self-discipline and entrepreneurialism here. He is famous for visiting government offices unannounced, and sometimes firing public officials who are not working.\n\u201cHe\u2019s one-third entrepreneur, with the bravado of Richard Branson; one-third builder, with the determination of Robert Moses; and one-third Ataturk-style social engineer who is trying to coax his people to rise to the task of running a global financial capital,\u201d said Jim Krane, the author of \u201cCity of Gold,\u201d a book on Dubai.\nBut even his admirers concede that he tried to do too much, too fast. He seems to have resented his dependence on Abu Dhabi, the capital of the Emirates federation, which gave Dubai an annual stipend worth about $2 billion until at least 2002. Sheik Mohammed pushed for revenue-generating projects to compensate for his emirate\u2019s lack of oil. He has often been criticized for relying on an army of low-wage foreign construction workers living in miserable conditions.\nOne of his central management strategies in recent years was a reliance on four top advisers, called \u201cthe four horsemen.\u201d He gave each of them a different Dubai company and forced them to compete. They did so with gusto, topping one another again and again as they built sprawling industrial parks and the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper.\nBankers and foreign advisers say that while the sheik preached openness and transparency, some of the board members of his companies pushed for licenses for family and friends, and other members of the ruling family asked for their shares in the profits.\nFew in Sheik Mohammed\u2019s advisory pool were willing to preach caution, even as property prices and asset values fell, say former and current top advisers and employees.\n\u201cThe attitude within business and government circles was that you don\u2019t pass on bad news\u201d to the sheik, said a former top executive at one of Dubai\u2019s leading companies. The local news media are extremely deferential to the ruling family and tend to cast all news about Dubai in a positive light.\nAs recently as April, Sheik Mohammed boasted, \u201cI can safely say that we have succeeded in containing the risks of the global financial crisis in record time.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, though, something changed. The sheik appeared to be under strain, and he started emphasizing the emirate\u2019s links with the United Arab Emirates, current and former advisers say. Just days before Dubai World\u2019s Nov. 25 announcement about its debt, he removed three of his four top advisers from the board of the Investment Corporation of Dubai, which oversees all government business. The board is now made up entirely of members of the ruling family.\nWhen Sheik Mohammed finally broke his silence about Dubai World on Tuesday, in an appearance honoring a national holiday, he played down the severity of the debt problems and accused the news media of exaggerating them.\n\u201cIt is the fruit-bearing tree that becomes the target\u201d of stone-throwers, he told reporters. \u201cWhat about someone who has seven fruit trees? It is normal for us to be facing this campaign and this media noise.\u201d\nThis sense of grievance may come down to Sheik Mohammed\u2019s \u2014 and Dubai\u2019s \u2014 origins. While Western investors may compare Dubai with New York and London, Sheik Mohammed and his Emirati peers are more inclined to weigh themselves against other Arab countries. By that standard, their prosperity \u2014 and Dubai\u2019s extraordinary record of peace and stability \u2014 are far more important than a few billion dollars of bad debt.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/middleeast/04dubai.html", "title": "Debt Crisis Tests Dubai\u2019s Ruler", "author": "ROBERT F.

{"date": "Sat, 03 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 When the United Nations convened its summit meeting on climate change last month, China and the United States, the two most important countries at the negotiating table, hewed to mostly familiar scripts, making promises without making too many specific commitments. Less familiar was the script followed by the third most important country at the table, India.\nIndia\u2019s public stance on climate change is usually predictable \u2014 predictably obstinate and unwilling to compromise, at least according to many industrialized nations. But at the United Nations, India\u2019s delegation toned down its usual criticisms of the industrialized world, presented new plans to reduce India\u2019s emissions and sought to reposition the country, in the words of the environment minister, as a \u201cdeal maker,\u201d not a \u201cdeal breaker.\u201d\nThe shift comes as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is pushing India to adopt a more internationalist posture on issues like climate change and trade as he seeks to expand India\u2019s global stature at a time when declining American influence is altering the geopolitical balance of power.\nMr. Singh\u2019s government has concluded that addressing climate change is intertwined with addressing domestic priorities like pollution, energy security and even national security.\nMoreover, analysts say, India\u2019s rigid, hard-line posture has backfired; the country has been typecast as intransigent, even as its putative ally on the issue, China, a far bigger source of emissions, has succeeded in creating the impression that the Chinese are more active and engaged.\n\u201cWe cannot compromise our basic national position on protecting our prospects for growth, but we can see things that can be done,\u201d said Nitin Desai, a member of the prime minister\u2019s special advisory council on climate change. \u201cThe signal that I get is that India is not going to be a spoiler at Copenhagen. If a reasonable deal can be worked out, they will be there.\u201d\nWith less than three months before final talks commence in Copenhagen, many analysts are deeply pessimistic that a comprehensive deal can be reached. But others are already discussing Plan B\u2019s that might give credit for domestic programs, like one proposed by India, instead of creating a global set of binding limits like those in the existing, but faltering, Kyoto Protocol.\nIndia\u2019s close alliance with China \u2014 they are co-leaders of the bloc of developing nations \u2014 has been rooted in their shared interest in protecting economic growth and has created the impression that the two countries share a similar emissions profile, but, in fact, they do not. China is a far bigger polluter. India\u2019s environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, said India had one-fifth of China\u2019s emissions, measured either in total or per capita amounts. Over all, China accounts for roughly 23 percent of all global emissions, while India accounts for less than 5 percent.\nThose disparities are why some analysts say the relationship is subtly shifting. China has now overtaken the United States as the biggest emitter in the world and is under pressure to assume responsibilities more in line with industrialized countries.\nIndia is worried that it could face similar expectations, based on its population size and potential for future growth, even though its levels of economic development and emissions lag far behind those of China.\nDavid G. Victor, an energy analyst who has studied India\u2019s situation, predicted that the Indian and Chinese positions could gradually separate.\nAs demands on developing countries increase, Mr. Victor predicted, their bloc will fragment. Low-per-capita emission countries, possibly led by India, may try to differentiate themselves from countries like Mexico, Brazil and China, which have more advanced economies and higher emissions.\n\u201cThe Indians need to be very careful that they are seen as a different kind of country,\u201d said Mr. Victor, who also teaches at the University of California, San Diego.\nMr. Ramesh, India\u2019s environment minister, said China and India were closely coordinating their positions on the negotiations, but he also conceded that China was winning the public relations battle.\n\u201cChina has raced way ahead of us, both in terms of emissions and in conveying the impression they are doing a lot on climate change,\u201d he said in an interview in New Delhi before he left for the United Nations summit meeting.\nMr. Ramesh said India\u2019s basic demands for signing an international accord were unchanged: that industrialized nations agree to significant emissions reductions by 2020 and also provide financial and technical assistance to the developing world. India also remains opposed to accepting any mandatory caps on emissions.\nBut regardless of the fate of the agreement, he said, India was moving forward anyway. His ministry would soon submit legislation to the Indian Parliament that would tighten fuel efficiency standards, set voluntary targets to improve energy efficiency, push ahead with solar power and expand the use of clean-coal technology in power plants.\n\u201cI want to be aggressive, because, frankly, we are a country that is climate dependent,\u201d he said, alluding to the vulnerability of India to rising sea waters and potentially disruptive annual monsoons. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to think about it, but we are vulnerable.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cOur prime minister\u2019s clear message to me was, \u2018India has to be part of the solution. We may not have caused the problem, but we have to be part of the solution.\u2019 \u201d\nAt the United Nations, Mr. Ramesh focused on practical issues like expanding forest cover, extending a treaty program encouraging investment in clean technologies and expanding technological cooperation.\n\u201cI think a lot of people welcomed that as a positive contribution,\u201d said Michael A. Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt showed engagement on substance rather than rhetoric.\u201d\nFor years, Indian negotiators defined climate change through the geopolitics of economic justice and national sovereignty, arguing that the industrialized world had a historical responsibility to bear the brunt of any global response while equating mandatory caps on emissions as being tantamount to capping India\u2019s economic growth.\nThese arguments are still deeply felt in India and continue to shape the domestic political debate; Mr. Singh was sharply criticized by some members of Parliament after he agreed with other leaders last summer in Italy that nations should prevent the average global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit from its current level.\nHis critics called the deal a trap to limit India\u2019s development.\nMr. Ramesh said part of his job was to build a new domestic political consensus about how India could constructively address climate change without damaging its national interests because \u201cwithout a solid domestic consensus, or even a domestic constituency, we cannot even think about engaging internationally.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is also true of the United States,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s true of all democracies.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/world/asia/04climate.html", "title": "New Script for India on Climate Change", "author": "JIM YARDLEY"}
{"date": "Mon, 26 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 In more than 80 years as a publicly financed broadcaster with an audience of millions at home and around the world, the BBC has rarely been buffeted as severely as it has in recent days over its decision not to broadcast a television appeal by aid agencies for victims of Israel\u2019s recent military actions in Gaza.\nBBC executives made the decision late last week and defiantly reaffirmed it on Monday, citing their concern with protecting the corporation\u2019s impartiality in the Arab-Israeli dispute.\nThe dispute stirs high passions here, and the BBC, like other news organizations, has struggled uneasily for years to strike a balance, even as some critics claim it has tilted heavily toward Israel and others claim it has favored the Palestinians.\nThe three-week Israeli campaign in Gaza that ended nine days ago had already elicited a fresh barrage of complaints about BBC bias, for and against Israel. But the decision to block the aid appeal had the effect of magnifying the protests, and their virulence.\nThe decision has met with angry criticism from Church of England archbishops, editorial writers and senior British government ministers, as well as sit-ins at the BBC\u2019s London headquarters and its broadcast center in Glasgow.\nNews planning sessions at the BBC have featured heated exchanges among editors and reporters, and BBC officials said Monday that they had received more than 11,000 complaints in the past three days.\nA strong undercurrent in many of the protests has been that the BBC gave in to pressure from Israel or Jewish groups, which the BBC has vehemently denied.\nA more common view has been that BBC executives, already wary because of a recent series of embarrassments unrelated to Middle East coverage, became so averse to controversy that they made an awkward extension of the concept of impartiality to a purely humanitarian issue.\nBut the BBC\u2019s director general, Mark Thompson, denied Monday to reporters that he had been subjected to \u201carm-twisting\u201d by pro-Israeli groups and said that the corporation had a duty to cover the Gaza dispute in a \u201cbalanced, objective way.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, everyone is struck by the human consequence of what has happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will, I promise you, continue to report that as fully and compassionately as we can. But we are going to do that in a way where we can hold it up to scrutiny. It\u2019s our job as journalists.\u201d\nThe three-minute video, which was shown on several other channels in Britain on Monday night, was prepared by the Disasters Emergency Committee, an organization representing 11 relief agencies. Among them are many of Britain\u2019s best-known charities, including the Red Cross, Oxfam, Save the Children, Help the Aged, Christian Aid and World Vision.\nThe committee has said the money it raises will buy food, medical supplies, tents, blankets and other necessities for those suffering in Gaza in the wake of the Israeli offensive and the military actions of Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that governs Gaza.\nIt asked broadcasters to show the appeal as a public service.\nThe BBC does not accept advertising but has shown humanitarian appeals on other issues, including the conflicts in Rwanda, Congo and Darfur. But to broadcast the appeal for aid to Gaza, BBC executives said, might compromise the impartiality of its Middle East coverage.\n\u201cWe worry about being seen to endorse something which could give people the impression that we were backing one side,\u201d Mr. Thompson said on the BBC\u2019s Web site.\nSome of the sharpest criticism of the BBC\u2019s decision on the Gaza appeal came from within its own ranks, from unions representing its newsroom staff and from retired editors and reporters.\nSir John Tusa, a former head of the BBC World Service, said the scenes of distressed children and families in Gaza captured in the video appeal were a matter of \u201ccommon humanity.\u201d\n\u201cNobody, surely, in their right mind, can say that is being partial towards the victims, as if somehow they deserved the fate they got,\u201d he said in a BBC radio interview.\n\u201cThe thing that worries me,\u201d he added, \u201cis that there is now an overcomplication of regulation and compliance and policy, and that in the course of that, common sense, and, I regret to say, humanity, seem to have been left behind.\u201d\nThe BBC was joined in its refusal to carry the appeal by Sky News, an independent broadcaster with a widely watched news channel. But three other broadcasters \u2014 the publicly owned Channel 4 and two private broadcasters, ITV and Channel 5 \u2014 accepted the appeal. As shown on Monday night, the video focused heavily on the plight of Palestinian children \u2014 small boys and girls wounded and sobbing, being rushed into hospital emergency wards and, at one point, a parent clutching a tiny white shroud. Other scenes were of apartment blocks collapsed into piles of twisted steel and rubble.\n\u201cThe children of Gaza are suffering,\u201d the narrator said. \u201cMany are struggling to survive, homeless or in need of food and water.\u201d\nThen, as if answering the view that the video amounted to anti-Israeli propaganda, he said: \u201cToday, this is not about the rights and wrongs of the conflict. These people simply need your help.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/world/europe/27britain.html", "title": "BBC Assailed for Refusing to Carry Gaza Appeal", "author": "JOHN F.

{"date": "Mon, 19 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "In many coastal regions, runoff from farms and sewers has caused widespread deaths of marine life. But fisheries off Egypt\u2019s Mediterranean coast appear to be thriving from a similar nutrient-laden brew, scientists reported Monday.\nThe fisheries had been stunted for decades after the Aswan Dam, built in the 1960s, blocked the flow of nutritious silt from annual flooding of the Nile. But an increasing flow of nitrogen-rich fertilizer and wastewater from an agricultural and urban boom around the Nile Delta has more than made up for the lost nutrients, scientists say.\nBy examining telltale traces of nitrogen in fish samples, American and Egyptian researchers found that fish that were caught where the Nile waters enter the sea were feeding on algae and plankton nourished by fertilizer and wastewater. In areas away from that flow, the nitrogen signature in sampled fish matched that of marine life in the central Mediterranean.\nThe situation stands in contrast to the so-called dead zones that large flows of human-generated nutrients have created in many other bodies of water. The zones are produced when excessive nitrogen nourishes blooms of toxic algae or plankton, or when it causes biological explosions in deep waters that can deplete oxygen, killing marine life.\nThe southeastern Mediterranean Sea is different because it is a \u201cmarine desert\u201d in which nutrients are quickly exploited, said Autumn Oczkowski, the leader of the new study and a doctoral candidate at the Graduate School of Oceanography of the University of Rhode Island. \u201cAdd any fertilizer, and you\u2019re going to see a big effect,\u201d she said. The study will be published in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nNancy N. Rabalais, a biologist focused on the human effects on fisheries, said the nitrogen-tracing showed the linkage between human effluent and fisheries in Egypt, but cautioned that conditions could still tip from providing benefits to creating problems.\nThe same transition happened along the Gulf Coast, said Dr. Rabalais, the executive director of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium. \u201cThe area near the Mississippi River Delta in the 1960s was known as the \u2018fertile fisheries crescent,\u2019 \u201d she said in an e-mail message. Now, she said, increased nutrients are \u201cleading to a massive dead zone most springs and summers.\u201d\nThere are lagoons within the Nile Delta where such dead zones have already appeared, Ms. Oczkowski said.

That party, led by Cape Town\u2019s mayor, Helen Zille, received 51 percent of the provincial vote.\nWhites and blacks populate Western Cape Province in near equal numbers, but the largest block of votes is people of mixed race and this time many of them deserted the A.N.C.\nMs. Zille, a 58-year-old former journalist, will become premier of Western Cape. As mayor, she won the 2008 World Mayor Prize by City Mayors, an international urban research organization.\n\u201cWe will try to govern as well as we can to show that life is better for everybody\u201d under the Democratic Alliance, she told a South African news agency.\nBut Ms. Zille\u2019s party won only 17 percent of the national vote, and while that was an improvement over the 12 percent it received in 2004, the Democratic Alliance is still largely seen as a white-dominated organization in a nation that is four-fifths black.\nThe group that broke away from the A.N.C., the Congress of the People, or COPE, won only 7 percent of the national vote. Some political analysts said this was a promising start for a party only months old, but it was a mere fraction of the support expected when the party was conceived.\nMore than 77 percent of South Africa\u2019s 23 million registered voters cast ballots in the election, which was praised for its fairness by international observers. Many voters stood patiently in line for several hours, enthusiastic about the opportunity to participate.\nThe A.N.C. has now won all four national elections in post-apartheid South Africa, with 63 percent of the votes under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, 66 and 70 percent under Thabo Mbeki, and now with 66 under Mr. Zuma.\nOpposition politicians, especially Ms. Zille, made the goal of depriving the A.N.C. of a two-thirds margin into a last-minute campaign crusade, arguing that such a majority would allow the party to unilaterally amend the Constitution. But the A.N.C., which narrowly missed that mark, has not previously used its power in that way.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not disturbed,\u201d Jessie Duarte, a party spokeswoman, said in a television interview. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a two-thirds majority to govern decisively.\u201d\nThe ascendance of Mr. Zuma, 67, represents a remarkable comeback. In 2005, with corruption charges looming against him, he was fired as the nation\u2019s deputy president by Mr. Mbeki, opening a schism within the party. Mr. Zuma has since dislodged Mr. Mbeki from the A.N.C. leadership, and, three weeks ago, shed the criminal case against him on procedural grounds.\nParliament elects the president, but the A.N.C.\u2019s dominance assures that Mr. Zuma will take the oath of office on May 9.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/world/africa/26SAFRICA.html", "title": "Final Results Show Resounding Victory for A.N.C. in South Africa", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}

In one, gunmen showered a traffic police officer with bullets while he was on duty in the city\u2019s western Risala neighborhood, killing the officer and a civilian bystander. Four other policemen, including another traffic officer, died in four additional attacks, according to a police official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the news media.\nIn the sixth attack, a woman was shot as she stepped out of her house in the eastern Mosul neighborhood of Palestine, in a burst of gunfire that also wounded her father, the official said.\nLater on Monday, a resident of Al-Majmoua Al-Thaqafiya, another eastside neighborhood, was shot dead on the street in a similar way, according to the official.\nThe shootings in Mosul came one day after Iraqi forces cordoned off a section of the city\u2019s east side to conduct house-to-house searches for insurgents, said Atheel al-Nujaifi, the provincial governor.\nSunday\u2019s operation was a purely Iraqi one, Mr. Nujaifi said. American soldiers, who had normally been involved in such operations, have largely left the center of Mosul since June 30 and are now garrisoned at a large base on the city\u2019s outskirts according to terms of the security agreement between Iraq and the United States.\nThe governor said Iraqi forces were capable of controlling the security in the city, which remains among the most violent in the country, but nonetheless expressed alarm at the specific singling out of traffic police officers.\n\u201cThis has not happened before,\u201d Mr. Nujaifi said. \u201cIt is a deliberate attempt by certain political forces to sow fear and unease among the population.\u201d\nMr. Nujaifi remains locked in a bitter dispute with a Kurdish-led coalition that has been boycotting his government since April. His predominantly Sunni Arab coalition, Al Hadba, which won 19 of the 37 seats on the provincial council in January\u2019s elections, froze the second-place Kurdish coalition out of all senior positions in the new government.

Many in the industry believe Opel has a future only if it can get a temporary helping hand from the German government.\nBut whether Chancellor Angela Merkel will make available the public financing needed to help release Opel from the clutches of General Motors now depends on a reluctant government, an influential automotive union that wants politicians to save jobs and employees who yearn to re-establish Opel as an independent German company.\nMrs. Merkel, up for re-election in the fall, is sensitive to complaints from her constituents in the business community about bailouts for big banks and other corporations and nothing for anyone else. She is promising only a close look at G.M.\u2019s plans for Opel, a stance that political experts here say may be a prelude to her dodging the issue entirely.\n\u201cThey might just play Ping-Pong with Opel,\u201d said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, the director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. \u201cThey say, \u2018We don\u2019t like the plan\u2019 and send them back home.\u201d\nSenior General Motors executives planned to meet with top officials from Mrs. Merkel\u2019s government on Friday in Berlin. Already, government officials have criticized Opel\u2019s plans for righting itself as lacking details.\nMrs. Merkel has wondered out loud whether Opel is a \u201csystem critical\u201d company in the way that major banks are. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German interior minister, said that an insolvency filing, for the purposes of reorganization, might be Opel\u2019s best bet.\n\u201cThe public perception is that insolvency is associated with going bust or bankruptcy,\u201d he told Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper. \u201cBut that is wrong. We must grasp that to survive such a crisis, modern insolvency rules are a better solution than the state taking a stake.\u201d\nG.M. lost more than $30 billion worldwide in 2008, and on Thursday its auditors released a report expressing \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its ability to continue to operate. But its problems are, broadly speaking, a European problem as well, because the company has operations in Germany, Belgium, Spain, Poland and Britain, home to its Vauxhall brand.\nGermany\u2019s major automotive trade union, IG Metall, has asserted that an Opel collapse could endanger as many as 400,000 jobs in Europe in the car industry and related businesses.\nTo sustain Opel and protect the jobs of its 29,000 workers in Germany, G.M. is asking for more than $4 billion in loan guarantees from European governments, the bulk of which would come from Germany.\nCarl-Peter Forster, the president of G.M. Europe, has also said G.M. will sell up to half of its subsidiary in Germany to a new investor, possibly the state. And he has hinted at a certain urgency, saying that an acute cash shortage and 30 percent production overcapacity could soon lead to the closing of three plants.\nAs part of any rescue plan, the German government is adamant about ensuring that none of its money flows back to General Motors headquarters in Detroit.\nBut detaching Opel from G.M. and refounding it as an independent company with a majority government stake \u2014 the demand of Opel\u2019s employees and union \u2014 may be the only way to accomplish that, analysts said.\n\u201cEighty years after we submitted control to G.M., Opel as a subsidiary has come of age,\u201d Klaus Franz, the top employee representative at Opel, told the protesters. \u201cA spinoff is the only viable option.\u201d\nWhile some governors from states with Opel factories seem open to the idea, Berlin has been much more reluctant.\nMrs. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, while still leading polls, has hemorrhaged support to the Free Democratic Party, the small business-friendly but socially liberal grouping that she hopes will help form a viable coalition in the next government.\nThose voters are indignant that the government rescued banks and now seems willing to do the same for another big company, according to Manfred G\u00fcllner, director of the Berlin-based Forsa Institute, a polling firm.\nMore important, he said, the people who say they would vote for the Free Democrats are the same ones who voted for the Christian Democrats last time. \u201cThese are business owners and the self-employed, who are very irritated,\u201d Mr. G\u00fcllner said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/world/europe/07germany.html", "title": "Germany\u2019s Leader in Hot Seat Over G.M.

{"date": "Wed, 22 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "VARGASHI, Russia \u2014 Alongside bargain retailers, cheap restaurants, debt collectors and bankruptcy lawyers, a midsize factory in Siberia is promoting a product that it hopes is just the thing for hard times. Employees here call it the \u201canti-democracy truck,\u201d a modified fire truck fitted with a water cannon and designed to quell riots.\n\u201cWe look at this as a product with a market,\u201d Vladimir N. Kazakov, the factory director, said in an interview in his office. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind who buys them. We would be happy to sell them to Israel, America or France.\u201d\nThe business, though, sheds some light on Russia in the financial crisis.\nThe country that was on the cusp of prosperity after so many years of post-Soviet turmoil is struggling through another uncertain period of economic change and social upheaval.\nThe water cannon business has become, in a sense, a barometer of social unrest in Russia, written up in Russian news magazines and joked about dryly on the Echo of Moscow radio station in the capital.\nMr. Kazakov said he expected two or three purchases of the roughly half-million dollar vehicles this year. The Russian Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, has asked the plant to be ready to re-outfit the assembly line to produce many quickly, if needed. But no solid orders have come in yet, he said.\n\u201cIf the order comes, we will fulfill it on time, and well,\u201d he said.\nThe truck is sold under the brand names Avalanche-Hurricane and, for a smaller model, the Storm. Shrouded in steel armor, it comes standard with brick- and cobblestone-resistant window grilles, sprinklers attached to a tank of chemical irritant like pepper spray, speakers that can emit ear-splitting noise and, of course, a powerful, joystick-operated water cannon. The cannon can topple protesters from dozens of yards away.\nEconomically related social unrest has already arisen throughout the lands of the former Soviet Union. Used-car dealers have taken to the streets in Vladivostok to protest tariffs. In Ukraine, where tens of thousands of steel workers are newly unemployed, protesters gathered on the central square in Kiev. Most recently, in Moldova, an angry crowd stormed the Parliament building and hurled furniture out the windows. Among the protesters were unemployed young people with little prospect of finding jobs in Moldova.\nIn that riot, incidentally, the pitfalls of using an off-the-rack fire truck for crowd control were on full display. News photographs showed protesters, pumping their fists in excitement, climbing on the dented hood of a standard-issue red-and-white fire truck, its windshield smashed and its crew long gone.\nIn Russia, the economy is doing an about-face from 6 percent growth in 2008 to an expected 2.2 percent contraction this year, according to government figures that are probably too optimistic, many economists say. With unemployment rolls swelling, protests are likely, said Yevgeny S. Gontmakher, a member of the board of the government-affiliated Institute of Contemporary Development, a research organization in Moscow. \u201cThe social consequences will grow all this year, we can say that with certainty.\u201d\nIn one measure of discontent, 39 percent of Russians in a national poll answered yes when asked if they had noticed a \u201crise in the mood to protest\u201d among their acquaintances.\nThe factory here in Vargashi, in the western part of Siberia, is the only plant in Russia with a government certificate to make water cannons, Mr. Kazakov said. It is also, paradoxically, situated in the type of struggling one-factory town where Mr. Gontmakher and others have said industrial unrest is most likely.\nA glum ensemble of gray apartment blocks and muddy streets, bisected by the trans-Siberian railway, the town is wholly dependent on the plant. Of 12,000 residents, 600 work there. Workers grumble that salaries are already falling.\nThe plant\u2019s fortunes followed the trajectory of the Russian economy as a whole; it flourished in the late Soviet period, producing 3,000 fire trucks a year and selling them to 27 countries, including Mongolia, Tanzania and Vietnam. In those days it had branched out into tank trucks for milk, and even produced a model called the spirtovoz, or spirit carrier, designed to transport vodka in bulk. A faded Communist-era mural that says \u201cGlory to the Working Class!\u201d still adorns a building here. In the current crisis, the plant is struggling. Production of fire trucks fell to 35 trucks in February from 70 in December.\nAnton Y. Sinagnoyev, a laid-off construction worker, said he supported the factory\u2019s new product, even if it was used against other laid-off workers like himself. He said he was happy that the plant had prospects. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t make them, somebody else would,\u201d he said.\nFactory managers said they hoped that police departments in Russia and elsewhere would trade up to customized crowd-control vehicles for the financial crisis. The trucks are far more effective in safely dispersing large, hostile groups than standard fire trucks, mounted police officers or lines of police officers with shields are, Mr. Kazakov said.\nBut for now, though, the new business strategy remains just that. Even if the company manages to sell the two or three water cannon trucks it hopes to sell this year, that will not begin to make up for the lost revenues from fire trucks, Mr. Kazakov conceded. \u201cThe situation in the country is not at that point,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/world/europe/23cannon.html", "title": "Russians Bet on a Market for Dampening Dissent", "author": "ANDREW E.

{"date": "Sat, 28 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 At a Supreme Court hearing on Thursday in a property dispute, the defendant, Gul Zameen, insisted that Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry personally take his case rather than assign it to other justices, as his opponent requested.\n\u201cPlease, I want you to hear the case,\u201d said Mr. Zameen, 55, who has been fighting over a house in North-West Frontier Province since 1991.\nMuch to his relief, Mr. Chaudhry agreed.\n\u201cWe hope he will do justice,\u201d Mr. Zameen\u2019s son, Shahid Rafiq, said later. \u201cNot only with us but with everybody.\u201d\nSince returning to the bench last week for the first time since he was ousted two years ago by Pervez Musharraf, then Pakistan\u2019s president, Mr. Chaudhry has faced a groundswell of expectations from people like Mr. Zameen and from the politicians and lawyers who struggled to get him reinstated. Just as his ouster became a national symbol of political interference in the judiciary, millions of Pakistanis have invested his return with hopes that he will set every injustice right.\n\u201cMany people saw him as a savior, and he is a savior for them, even though the lawyers\u2019 movement was essentially aimed at upholding the rule of law,\u201d said Babar Sattar, a constitutional lawyer, who warned that such unrealistic hopes were bound to produce disappointments. \u201cSome expectations will be frustrated, as a lot of different people have different expectations.\u201d\nThe tangle of thorny legal issues awaiting Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s pen include many politically charged cases, like those regarding hundreds of people who disappeared after they were detained without charges by the Musharraf government on suspicion of terrorism.\nTwo cases bear directly on the fortunes of the nation\u2019s most prominent political leaders, President Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader.\nIn one, the court is expected to review the amnesty from corruption charges that Mr. Musharraf gave Benazir Bhutto, a former prime minister who was assassinated in December 2007, and her husband, Mr. Zardari.\nThe other is expected to come before the court on Monday, when it is scheduled to hear a petition regarding Mr. Sharif\u2019s ability to run for public office. Last month the Supreme Court disqualified Mr. Sharif and his brother, who was the chief minister of Punjab Province, from holding elective office because of a criminal conviction connected to the military coup that ousted Mr. Sharif in 1999.\nMr. Sharif, then the prime minister, had ordered that a plane carrying the coup leader, Mr. Musharraf, then the army chief, not be allowed to land in Pakistan. The coup succeeded, and Mr. Sharif was convicted on hijacking charges and forced into exile.\nThe revisiting of this case is fraught with potential conflicts of interest because Mr. Sharif led the political movement to return Mr. Chaudhry to office.\nOn Friday, Mr. Chaudhry defused some of the controversy by appointing a five-member bench, which did not include him, to hear the case.\nLike the Sharif case, the review of Mr. Zardari\u2019s amnesty is another in which Mr. Chaudhry may be seen to have a less than impartial interest. Mr. Zardari had blocked Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s reinstatement. Mr. Sharif has said the reason was that Mr. Zardari feared that the judge would repeal the amnesty.\nMr. Sattar, the constitutional lawyer, said a reversal of the amnesty law would not necessarily result in a criminal trial for Mr. Zardari, who as president has immunity from prosecution. But Mr. Chaudhry should review the amnesty, he said, because it \u201cis a bad law that has a corrupting influence.\u201d\nMr. Zardari and Ms. Bhutto had maintained that the corruption charges were politically motivated.\nMr. Chaudhry has so far given no indication of whether he will hear the case. He has, however, chosen to keep his distance from the government, declining two requests from Mr. Zardari to attend government functions.\nOther potential minefields include cases involving the judges appointed by Mr. Musharraf and Mr. Zardari to replace those removed by Mr. Musharraf. Petitions have been filed with the court to remove them.\nIf Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s ouster was illegal, Mr. Sattar said, then \u201cthe entire legal structure that came into being\u201d afterward should be reviewed.\n\u201cIf Justice Chaudhry has taken an oath to uphold the law, then he has to consider the legality of Musharraf\u2019s actions,\u201d Mr. Sattar added.\nAnother petition filed early last week seeks to hold Mr. Musharraf guilty of high treason.\nEach of these cases will be watched carefully and are seen by some as a trial for Mr. Chaudhry, whatever he decides.\n\u201cNow the court has to carefully decide where it should exercise restraint and where it shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Sattar said.\nBeing a folk hero only adds to the pressure. Last Tuesday, when Mr. Chaudhry triumphantly entered the Supreme Court, a throng of jubilant lawyers and families of the disappeared welcomed him. Rose petals were thrown on his black Honda Accord. Placards bearing slogans of support were raised.\nMr. Chaudhry shook hands with admiring court employees.\n\u201cGreat expectations are vested in his person,\u201d Ikram Sehgal, an analyst based Karachi, wrote in an opinion article in The News, the country\u2019s leading newspaper. \u201cCan he assuage the people\u2019s aspirations? Rebuilding the stature of the Supreme Court, he can either play to the gallery and follow the path of retribution or take the high road of reconciliation.\u201d\nOne of the people hoping for Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s help is Amina Masood Janjua, who has led the campaign to locate hundreds of those who disappeared, including her husband. But she recognizes that justice so long awaited may not come instantly.\n\u201cOur lawyers are telling us to hold on, don\u2019t be impatient,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least, we should give him 10 days.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/world/asia/29chaudhry.html", "title": "Reinstated, Chief Justice Bears Hopes of Pakistan", "author": "SALMAN MASOOD"}

Putin\u2019s governing party has won handily in regional elections, Russia\u2019s Central Election Commission said Monday, in his first electoral test since the economy began to turn dire.\nMr. Putin\u2019s party, United Russia, won the majority of seats in all nine regions where local parliamentary elections were held Sunday, and nearly swept smaller municipal elections. The Communist Party, which complained of widespread violations, came in a distant second.\nUnited Russia officials called the resounding victory evidence that Mr. Putin\u2019s response to the economic crisis, including supporting the ruble and selected bailouts, had spared many Russians the ill effects of a rapidly tumbling economy.\n\u201cThese elections show that the steps taken by the government and the legislature are correct and directed at preventing serious impacts of the global crisis on the economic situation in Russia,\u201d said Boris Gryzlov, the party chairman.\nBut many independent analysts say that elections have become little more than technical exercises since Mr. Putin came to power as president in 2000 and offer only a haphazard indication of voter preference.\nTelevision and many other media outlets are largely tilted in favor of United Russia, and, out of four parties in the federal Parliament, only one, the Communist Party, offers real, if pliable, opposition to Mr. Putin\u2019s party.\n\u201cThis was just a small, uninteresting show,\u201d said Anton Orekh, a political commentator on Echo Moskvy radio. Public interest in elections, he said, has become \u201cslightly less than low.\u201d\nStill, Mr. Putin remains the country\u2019s most popular politician. But some analysts pointed to a slight slip of several percentage points by United Russia in some regions, compared with previous elections, as an indication that increasing unemployment and rising prices have begun to take a toll on the party.\nThe Communist Party made small gains, despite what Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, called major violations of election laws.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/world/europe/03russia.html", "title": "Putin\u2019s Party Wins Regional Elections", "author": "MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ"}
{"date": "Thu, 27 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has written a searing critique of government efforts at \u201cstrategic communication\u201d with the Muslim world, saying that no amount of public relations will establish credibility if American behavior overseas is perceived as arrogant, uncaring or insulting.\nThe critique by the chairman, Adm. Mike Mullen, comes as the United States is widely believed to be losing ground in the war of ideas against extremist Islamist ideology. The issue is particularly relevant as the Obama administration orders fresh efforts to counter militant propaganda, part of its broader strategy to defeat the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\u201cTo put it simply, we need to worry a lot less about how to communicate our actions and much more about what our actions communicate,\u201d Admiral Mullen wrote in the critique, an essay to be published Friday by Joint Force Quarterly, an official military journal.\n\u201cI would argue that most strategic communication problems are not communication problems at all,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are policy and execution problems. Each time we fail to live up to our values or don\u2019t follow up on a promise, we look more and more like the arrogant Americans the enemy claims we are.\u201d\nWhile President Obama has sought to differentiate himself from his predecessor, George W. Bush, in the eyes of the Muslim world \u2014 including through a widely praised speech in Egypt on June 4 \u2014 the perception of America as an arrogant oppressor has not changed noticeably, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, where United States forces remain engaged in war, and in Pakistan, where American-launched missiles aimed at militants from the Taliban and Al Qaeda have killed civilians.\nLast week, during a visit to Pakistan by Richard C. Holbrooke, Mr. Obama\u2019s special envoy, Pakistanis told his entourage that America was widely despised in their country because, they said, it was obsessed with finding and killing Osama bin Laden to avenge the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nAdmiral Mullen expressed concern over a trend to create entirely new government and military organizations to manage a broad public relations effort to counter anti-Americanism, which he said had allowed strategic communication to become a series of bureaucracies rather than a way to combat extremist ideology.\nHe also challenged a popular perception that Al Qaeda operates from primitive hide-outs and still wins the propaganda war against the United States. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t that we are bad at communicating or being outdone by men in caves,\u201d Admiral Mullen wrote. \u201cMost of them aren\u2019t even in caves. The Taliban and Al Qaeda live largely among the people. They intimidate and control and communicate from within, not from the sidelines.\u201d\nAmerican messages to counter extremist information campaigns \u201clack credibility, because we haven\u2019t invested enough in building trust and relationships, and we haven\u2019t always delivered on promises,\u201d he wrote.\nAs a guide, Admiral Mullen cited American efforts at rebuilding Europe after World War II and then containing communism as examples of successes that did not depend on opinion polls or strategic communication plans. He cited more recent military relief missions after natural disasters as continuing that style of successful American efforts overseas.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the essence of good communication: having the right intent up front and letting our actions speak for themselves,\u201d Admiral Mullen wrote. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t care if people don\u2019t like us. That isn\u2019t the goal. The goal is credibility. And we earn that over time.\u201d\nMembers of Congress also have expressed concern about the government\u2019s programs for strategic communication, public diplomacy and public affairs. Both the Senate and House Armed Services Committees have raised questions about the Pentagon\u2019s programs for strategic communication \u2014 and about how money is spent on them.\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee issued a budget report last month noting that while \u201cstrategic communications and public diplomacy programs are important activities,\u201d it was unclear whether these efforts were integrated within the Pentagon or across other departments and agencies. \u201cNor is the committee able to oversee adequately the funding for the multitude of programs,\u201d the Senate report stated.\nAdmiral Mullen did not single out specific government communications programs for criticism, but wrote that \u201cthere has been a certain arrogance to our \u2018strat comm\u2019 efforts.\u201d He wrote that \u201cgood communications runs both ways.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about telling our story,\u201d he stated. \u201cWe must also be better listeners.\u201d\nThe Muslim community \u201cis a subtle world we don\u2019t fully \u2014 and don\u2019t always attempt to \u2014 understand,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnly through a shared appreciation of the people\u2019s culture, needs and hopes for the future can we hope ourselves to supplant the extremist narrative.\u201d\nHe acknowledged that the term strategic communication was \u201cprobably here to stay,\u201d but argued that it should be limited to describing \u201cthe process by which we integrate and coordinate\u201d government communications programs.\nCoinciding with the publication of his essay, Admiral Mullen released a YouTube video inviting questions from members of the armed services and the public on a range of national security and military personnel issues for an online discussion.\n\u201cThe chairman intends to use social media to expand the two-way conversation with service members and the public,\u201d said a statement announcing the interactive video question-and-answer session.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/world/28military.html", "title": "Message to Muslim World Gets a Critique", "author": "THOM SHANKER"}

Instead, they said they would press for long-term health care for the victims and demand medical research into the illnesses that still afflict tens of thousands of children.\nThe parents, who have gathered 250 signatures since Sunday, have become an irksome challenge to officials seeking to quell public anger over the widespread contamination of the nation\u2019s dairy supply.\nNearly 300,000 children became sick and at least six infants died after consuming milk products laced with melamine, an industrial chemical often used in the manufacture of plastics and fertilizer. Melamine, which causes kidney ailments, was added to watered-down milk in an effort to falsely indicate the presence of protein.\nZhao Lianhai, 37, the father of a 4-year-old boy made ill by the milk, said the $160 million compensation plan announced last month was inadequate and failed to address the medical needs of children whose health had been profoundly damaged.\n\u201cOur biggest demand is not the compensation, but medical treatment and academic research on the influence that melamine will have on the health of our children,\u201d Mr. Zhao, a former journalist, said in interview. \u201cWe want to know what kinds of lives our children will face.\u201d\nThe current offer, which is to be financed by 22 dairy companies, provides about $29,000 for each family that lost a child and about $4,400 for each child who suffered serious kidney damage. The families of children with relatively minor health problems would receive about $290. That is about three months of the average worker\u2019s salary.\nIn recent months some of the parents have filed lawsuits against the companies, although the courts have refused to accept the cases. On Jan. 1, five people, including Mr. Zhao, were detained by the authorities shortly before they were to hold a news conference in Beijing. They were held overnight and released.\nLast week, the former chairwoman of Sanlu, one of the nation\u2019s largest milk producers, pleaded guilty to selling adulterated baby formula. The executive, Tian Wenhua, could be sentenced to life imprisonment or death.\nIn testimony late last month, Ms. Tian said the company knew about the contamination as early as last May, but had failed to notify the authorities. Mr. Zhao said that the parents posted a version of their letter online on Saturday demanding greater compensation, but that it had been blocked by government censors. Among the parents\u2019 complaints, he said, is a rule that withholds compensation for children over 3 years old. He added that the package provided no assistance to the families that incurred tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills.\nHe added that his own son still vomited, and that many parents were worried that unforeseen health care problems could emerge over time. \u201cThe compensation is really not the most important thing,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney won\u2019t help if our children are still sick 10 years later.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/world/asia/14china.html", "title": "Parents Reject China Milk Settlement", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}

Medvedev, said Friday.\nMeeting on the outskirts of the global climate change conference here, the two men said they had resolved almost all of the remaining difficulties and planned to finalize a pact soon. \u201cI\u2019m confident we will conclude this agreement in a timely fashion,\u201d Mr. Obama said, seated next to Mr. Medvedev for photographs after the hourlong meeting.\nObama administration officials had said before coming to Copenhagen that they did not expect to conclude the pact to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 1991, known as Start, until after this trip and probably not until early next year.\nOn Friday, the White House said that negotiators had started on a holiday break that would last into early January.\nStart expired on Dec. 5; the two countries have been operating on an interim agreement since. The new version of Start would require each side to reduce deployed strategic nuclear warheads to roughly 1,600, down from 2,200, administration officials said. It would also force each side to reduce its strategic bombers and land- and sea-based missiles to below 800, down from the old limit of 1,600. The remaining issues to be resolved center on verification, American officials said.\nIf the lingering differences can be addressed, the Obama administration hopes to build on the trust established in the last eight months and plunge back into talks for a broader agreement to reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads even further, perhaps to about 1,000 for each country, a level considered the lowest the two would go without bringing in China, Britain, France and other nuclear powers.\nThat agreement is expected to be far more difficult to achieve, nuclear experts said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/19/world/19treaty.html", "title": "U.S. and Russia Close on Arms Pact, Leaders Say", "author": "HELENE COOPER"}

{"date": "Sat, 11 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TURBAT, Pakistan \u2014 Three local political leaders were seized from a small legal office here in April, handcuffed, blindfolded and hustled into a waiting pickup truck in front of their lawyer and neighboring shopkeepers. Their bodies, riddled with bullets and badly decomposed in the scorching heat, were found in a date palm grove five days later.\nLocal residents are convinced that the killings were the work of the Pakistani intelligence agencies, and the deaths have provided a new spark for revolt across Baluchistan, a vast and restless province in Pakistan\u2019s southwest where the government faces yet another insurgency.\nAlthough not on the same scale as the Taliban insurgency in the northwest, the conflict in Baluchistan is steadily gaining ground. Politicians and analysts warn that it presents a distracting second front for the authorities, drawing off resources, like helicopters, that the United States provided Pakistan to fight the Taliban and Al Qaeda.\nBaluch nationalists and some Pakistani politicians say the Baluch conflict holds the potential to break the country apart \u2014 Baluchistan makes up a third of Pakistan\u2019s territory \u2014 unless the government urgently deals with years of pent up grievances and stays the hand of the military and security services.\nHundreds, possibly thousands, of Baluch were rounded up in a harsh regime of secret detentions and torture under President Pervez Musharraf, who left office last year. Human rights groups and Baluch activists say those abuses have continued under President Asif Ali Zardari, despite promises to heal tensions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty volatile,\u201d said Nawab Zulfiqar Ali Magsi, the governor of Baluchistan. \u201cWhen you try to forcibly pacify people, you will get a reaction.\u201d\nThe discovery of the men\u2019s bodies on April 8 set off days of rioting and weeks of strikes, demonstrations and civil resistance. In schools and colleges, students pulled down the Pakistani flag and put up the pale blue, red and green Baluch nationalist flag.\nSchoolchildren still refuse to sing the national anthem at assemblies, instead breaking into a nationalist Baluch song championing the armed struggle for independence, teachers and parents said.\nFor the first time, women, traditionally secluded in Baluch society, have joined street protests against the continuing detentions of nationalist figures. Graffiti daubed on walls around this town call for independence and guerrilla war, which persists in large parts of the province.\nThe nationalist opposition stems from what it sees as the forcible annexation of Baluchistan by Pakistan 62 years ago at Pakistan\u2019s creation. But much of the popular resentment stems from years of economic and political marginalization, something President Zardari promised to remedy but has done little to actually address.\nIn interviews, people in and around Turbat said the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies were still doggedly pursuing nationalist sympathizers.\nA case in point, they say, is that of the three political figures who were killed: Gul Muhammad, Lala Munir and Sher Muhammad, all prominent in the nationalist movement.\nGovernment officials say the men were being prosecuted for activities against the state but deny any involvement in their deaths. People are not convinced and say that while the men supported independence, they were not involved in the armed struggle.\nMir Kachkol Ali, the men\u2019s lawyer, who witnessed their abduction, said the killings represented a deepening of the campaign by the Pakistani military to crush the Baluch nationalist movement. \u201cTheir tactics are not only to torture and detain, but to eliminate,\u201d he said.\nThe insurgents, who say they are led by the Baluchistan Liberation Army, have escalated their tactics, too. A prominent example was the kidnapping in February of an American citizen, John Solecki, the head of the United Nations refugee organization in the provincial capital, Quetta.\nThe abduction was carried out by a breakaway group of young radicals who wanted to draw international attention to their cause and to exchange their captive for Baluch being held by the security services.\nMr. Solecki was released in April after the intervention of Baluch leaders, including Gul Muhammad. Baluch leaders speculate that the intelligence agencies may have killed Mr. Muhammad and his colleagues to provoke the kidnappers into murdering the American, which would have branded the Baluch nationalists as terrorists.\nInstead, \u201cthe killing of these three has centralized the national movement of Baluchistan,\u201d Mr. Ali, the lawyer, said.\nHe and others said they had no doubt that the intelligence services were responsible.\nThe three men were in his office on April 3 when a half-dozen armed men seized them, he said.\n\u201cThey were persons of the agencies,\u201d Mr. Ali said. \u201cThey were in plain clothes, but from their hairstyles, their language, we know them.\u201d Mr. Ali has lodged a case with the police against the intelligence agencies for the abduction and murder of the three.\nNisar Ahmed, a shopkeeper and friend of the political leaders, said he saw them pushed into a pickup truck. He also said that the armed men appeared to be intelligence agents and that they were escorted by a second vehicle with 10 more armed men, also in plain clothes, who looked to be from the Frontier Corps paramilitary force.\nWhile the insurgency remains strong in other parts of Baluchistan, the military has largely crushed the resistance around Turbat since March 2007, yet armed men are still in the hills and continue to be rounded up, residents here said.\nYousuf Muhammad, the brother of Gul Muhammad, one of the slain political leaders, said that in February he was hung by his hands from the ceiling for 48 hours in a Pakistani military camp.\n\u201cThey came to arrest Gul Muhammad but they found me,\u201d he said. Another brother, Obeidullah, said Gul Muhammad had received threats from people in the intelligence agencies warning him to stop his work. The latest came 10 days before his death, he said.\nA group of students in the nearby town of Tump said they were rounded up and held in various army camps without charge for seven months in 2007. Some said they were suspended by their hands or their feet until they passed out, were beaten and were held in solitary confinement. Each showed a blackened mark where a toenail had been pulled out.\nThe arrests and disappearances have hardened attitudes, townspeople said, particularly among the young.\nEven the governor, who is the president\u2019s representative in the province, expressed exasperation at the Zardari government\u2019s inaction in addressing the needs of the population. Many Baluch are increasingly cynical about the government\u2019s ability to change things.\nSayed Hassan Shah, the minister for industry and commerce in Baluchistan, said his party was now demanding provincial autonomy.\n\u201cThis is our last option,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we fail, then maybe we have to think of liberation or separation.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/world/asia/12baluchistan.html", "title": "Another Insurgency Gains in Pakistan", "author": "CARLOTTA GALL"}

{"date": "Sat, 06 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "DHARAMSALA, India \u2014 For centuries, the selection of the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama has been steeped in the mysticism of a bygone world.\nOn the windswept Tibetan plateau, his closest aides look for divinations in a sacred lake. A mountain god transmits oracular messages by possessing a high lama. Monks scour villages for boys precocious in their spiritual attunement.\nAll that is about to change, as the current Dalai Lama and his followers in exile here in India compete with the Chinese government for control of how the 15th Dalai Lama will be chosen. The issue is urgent for the Tibetans because the current Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of all Tibetans and the charismatic face of the exile movement, has had recent bouts of ill health. He turns 74 in July.\nBoth the Chinese and the Tibetan exiles are bracing for an almost inevitable outcome: the emergence into the world of dueling Dalai Lamas \u2014 one chosen by the exiles, perhaps by the 14th Dalai Lama himself, and the other by Chinese officials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge but ultracritical issue, with no clear outcome or solution except one: trouble,\u201d said Robert Barnett, a Tibet scholar at Columbia University. \u201cIt is going to end up with two Dalai Lamas and thus with long-running conflict, unless the Chinese agree to a diplomatic solution pretty soon.\u201d\nThe jockeying has put the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Communist Party in surprising positions. The Dalai Lama said late last month in an interview with The New York Times that all options for choosing his reincarnation were open, including ones that break from tradition. That could mean that the next Dalai Lama would be found outside Tibet, could be a woman or might even be named while the 14th Dalai Lama was still alive, before his soul properly transmigrated. Meanwhile, the party, officially atheist and accused of ravaging Tibetan culture, insists that religious customs must be followed.\nA traditional selection process would be easily controlled by the Chinese government, since the process is rooted in the landscape of Tibet, which the Chinese seized in 1951. China has already positioned itself in other ways, including enacting a law in 2007 that says all reincarnations of senior lamas must be approved by the government.\nHere in Dharamsala, India, where the Dalai Lama lives, religious leaders have been debating whether to bypass the traditional process. Meanwhile, many Tibetans say they will honor whatever the Dalai Lama decides to do.\n\u201cThis is a religious matter,\u201d the Dalai Lama said in the interview. \u201cOf course there\u2019s a political implication there, but it\u2019s mainly a religious matter, spiritual matter, so therefore I have to discuss it with leaders, spiritual leaders.\u201d\nThe figure of the Dalai Lama, head of the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism, is without rival in influence among Tibetans and many Buddhists worldwide. He is revered as the reincarnation of Chenrezig, a deity who has chosen to remain on earth to help people achieve enlightenment. Many of China\u2019s six million Tibetans keep photos of him in their mud-walled homes, monasteries and nomadic tents, or hidden in the folds of their clothes, even though the government has outlawed all images of the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959.\nThe Chinese government accuses the Dalai Lama of being a separatist, though he demands only genuine autonomy for Tibet.\nThe Communist Party, aware that Buddhism is central to Tibetans, has tried to select and prop up lamas who will support the government while still retaining legitimacy among the people.\nIn 1995, when the Dalai Lama confirmed a boy in Tibet as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second-ranking leader of the Gelugpa sect, the Chinese government whisked away the boy and his parents and installed its own child lama. The Dalai Lama\u2019s choice, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, now 20, is still hidden from public view, while the government\u2019s selection shows up at official events to praise Communist policy \u2014 and is seen by many Tibetans as a fraud.\nChinese leaders also tried to groom the Karmapa, the reincarnated head of the Kagyu sect, but he fled to India in 1999, at age 14. He now sits by the Dalai Lama at prayer ceremonies here.\n\u201cThis is one of the chief indicators that China has failed in Tibet,\u201d said Mr. Barnett, the Columbia scholar. \u201cIt\u2019s failed to find consistent leadership in Tibet by any Tibetan lama who is really respected by Tibetan people, and who at the same time endorses Communist Party rule.\u201d\nChinese officials are hoping that will change with their selection of the next Dalai Lama. Lian Xianming, a scholar at the China Tibetology Research Center, a government-supported institution in Beijing, said that since the Qing Dynasty, which began in the 17th century, all reincarnations of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama required approval by Beijing after going through the traditional method of selection. \u201cThe real Dalai Lama will be the one who has gone through the historical process,\u201d he said.\nThat was the process used to find the current one. After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1933, senior lamas journeyed on horseback to the sacred lake of Lhamo Lhatso, not far from Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. There, they said, they received a vision that pointed to eastern Tibet as the site where the reincarnation would be found. Earlier, a medium of the Nechung Oracle, the mountain god that serves as the state fortuneteller, was said to have turned eastward in a trance.\nThree search parties were dispatched; one identified a boy in a farming village as the reincarnation. The boy, Lhamo Dhondrub, had had to prove his worth by, among other things, picking out objects belonging to the 13th Dalai Lama, including spectacles, rosary beads and a walking stick. He was enthroned as the Dalai Lama in 1940.\nAlthough the Chinese insist the traditional process must be followed, Mr. Barnett said Tibetan Buddhism allows great flexibility in changing old systems.\nThe Dalai Lama said one possibility was that his reincarnation would be chosen and trained even while he was alive, \u201cso some of my sort of work is carried continuously.\u201d That, however, is a controversial point among lamas, some of whom insist that a successor can be chosen only after the Dalai Lama\u2019s death.\nTibetans fear that a leadership vacuum after the Dalai Lama\u2019s death could weaken the movement. In the past, the periods that followed the deaths of the Dalai Lama, when Tibet was governed by regents, were less stable, because the regents did not have the mandate of the Dalai Lama. Regents also often engaged in power struggles with rivals \u2014 stories of one lama poisoning or imprisoning another were not uncommon.\nThough the government-in-exile has an elected prime minister, many people here now point to the Karmapa, 23, as a possible interim communal leader following the Dalai Lama\u2019s death. Often at the Dalai Lama\u2019s side, he is seen as charismatic by many Tibetans. He was once endorsed by the Chinese government, speaks Mandarin Chinese and practices Chinese calligraphy, making him a possible bridge to Beijing.\n\u201cBecause a lot of people have faith and confidence in me, there\u2019s kind of a momentum for me to do something,\u201d he said on the rooftop of a monastery near Dharamsala. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a challenging situation, but one can put oneself to a test.\u201d\nStill, the case of the Karmapa illustrates how fraught selecting a reincarnation can be.\nLong ago, the Dalai Lama recognized the man who fled here in 1999 as the 17th Karmapa.\nBut a senior lama in the Kagyu sect has been promoting another Tibetan living in India as the true successor \u2014 a conflict that presages the dilemma of a doppelg\u00e4nger Dalai Lama.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/world/asia/07lama.html", "title": "China Creates Specter of Dueling Dalai Lamas", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

People are still taking to their roofs in several Tehran neighborhoods around 10 p.m. each night to chant \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d God is great, for about 20 minutes.\nHe said he was in regular contact with friends and relatives in other major cities like Isfahan and Shiraz to the south and Mashhad to the east, and that a similar mood prevailed in those cities.\nIndeed, travelers from across Iran, from major cities to small towns, confirmed a heavy presence of security forces and an end to most public political demonstrations.\n\u201cThe government should allow people to express their opinion,\u201d the Tehran resident said, speaking in English. \u201cWe want to have a democratic place for talking and negotiating with each other. We want justice.\u201d\nHe said he voted for Mir Hussein Moussavi, the reformist presidential candidate who has accused the authorities of rigging the elections, and that Mr. Moussavi\u2019s supporters were now being labeled opponents of the Islamic Revolution.\nIsmail, 35, an engineer from Shiraz working on a tunnel project in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya, said that security forces were in control of Shiraz and that demonstrations by Mr. Moussavi\u2019s followers had ended there.\n\u201cAhmadinejad is the only person that gave poor citizens a better life,\u201d said Ismail, who voted for him.\nMany Iranians regard Mr. Ahmadinejad as a pious and strong populist leader who has paid attention to the needs of the poor, especially outside Tehran, and who has stood up to what they view as a meddlesome and hostile West.\n\u201cAhmadinejad talks the talk and walks the walk,\u201d said Amir Jaafari, 37, who arrived with three friends from Qum, Iran\u2019s religious capital, south of Tehran.\nMr. Jaafari, who owns a furniture store in Qum\u2019s bazaar, said the situation in that city was \u201cvery quiet\u201d after the \u201ccommotion\u201d that followed the elections.\nHaidar Amirallah, 40, a truck driver from the outskirts of Isfahan, said members of the Basij, the pro-government militia, were out in large numbers on the city\u2019s streets while security forces have expanded their patrols.\n\u201cIf you do not interfere in politics, you can move around freely,\u201d he said.\nMr. Amirallah said that he voted for Mr. Ahmadinejad and that he backed the crackdown against Moussavi supporters.\n\u201cThey want freedom like in Europe away from Islam,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to have sex, drink alcohol and do everything that Europeans do. We reject this.\u201d\nMahtab, 24, said she voted for Mr. Moussavi because he made promises to the youth to reform Iran\u2019s political system and grant women more rights and representation in top government posts.\n\u201cAfter the results were announced, I felt a huge letdown,\u201d she said. \u201cWe soon found out though that he in fact won but that cheating pushed him out.\u201d\nShe lives with her husband in Sanandaj in Iranian Kurdistan but said she had just visited her family in Islamabad-e-gharb in neighboring Kermanshah Province.\n\u201cPeople in my city are divided,\u201d said Mahtab, who was veiled and wore a coat over a long black dress, referring to Islamabad-e-gharb.\nBecause Bashmagh lies in the Kurdish region, many of the travelers here are Kurds, visiting relatives across the border. Iranian Kurds, who have always had a troubled relationship with the government, have adopted a largely ambivalent attitude toward recent events.\nSanandaj and other cities and towns with significant Kurdish populations had none of the pro-Moussavi protests that swept Tehran, according to several residents. Many Kurds feel disenfranchised by Iranian politics and have a healthy fear of the security forces, which have long had a strong presence in Kurdish areas.\nReza, a 25-year-old dentist from Bokan, a Kurdish town in West Azerbaijan Province, said that he did not vote but that some of his friends who voted for Mr. Moussavi did not dare take to the streets.\n\u201cIf there are gatherings, they are in homes and in secret,\u201d he said.\nBut the authorities seem to be taking no chances.\nAfshin, 32, said that on the day the election results were certified last month, hundreds of riot police officers wielding batons swarmed Azadi Square, or Freedom Square, in central Sanandaj in a show of force even though there were no gatherings or protests.\n\u201cI did not vote because elections in Iran are a charade,\u201d he said.\nAbu Bakr Modarresi, a leader of a Kurdish-Iranian dissident group based in Iraq, said that while he was \u201cexcited\u201d by the Moussavi movement, telling his supporters in Iran to take to the streets would have been tantamount to murder because government forces would have simply shot them.\nHe said a more realistic act of solidarity was a call for a general strike on June 25 that resulted in the closing of shops and businesses in some parts of Iranian Kurdistan.\n\u201cWe support this moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThings will never go back to normal.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/middleeast/09border.html", "title": "A Peek in Iran: Protests Fade Under Withering Gaze", "author": "SAM DAGHER"}

NATO is currently conducting military exercises in Georgia, which have angered neighboring Russia. Georgia was defeated by Russia in a war over two enclaves last August.\nThe opposition has contended that Mr. Saakashvili, who took power after an uprising in 2003 that removed a government considered a Soviet holdover, has turned into an autocrat who has mismanaged the economy and blundered into the war with Russia. Opposition leaders have said they will not halt their protests until Mr. Saakashvili resigns.\nMr. Saakashvili has said he will do nothing to block the protests but will serve out his term, which ends in 2013.

{"date": "Sun, 26 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 The United States and Iraq will begin negotiating possible exceptions to the June 30 deadline for withdrawing American combat troops from Iraqi cities, focusing on the troubled northern city of Mosul, according to military officials. Some parts of Baghdad also will still have combat troops.\nEverywhere else, the withdrawal of United States combat troops from all Iraqi cities and towns is on schedule to finish by the June 30 deadline, and in many cases even earlier. But because of the level of insurgent activity in Mosul, United States and Iraqi military officials will meet Monday to decide whether to consider the city an exception to the deadline in the Status of Forces Agreement, or SOFA, between the countries.\n\u201cMosul is the one area where you may see U.S. combat forces operating in the city\u201d after June 30, the United States military\u2019s top spokesman in Iraq, Maj. Gen. David Perkins, said in an interview.\nIn Baghdad, however, there are no plans to close the Camp Victory base complex, consisting of five bases housing more than 20,000 soldiers, many of them combat troops. Although Victory is only a 15 minute drive from the center of Baghdad and sprawls over both sides of the city\u2019s boundary, Iraqi officials say they have agreed to consider it outside the city.\nIn addition, Forward Operating Base Falcon, which can hold 5,000 combat troops, will also remain after June 30. It is just within Baghdad\u2019s southern city limits. Again, Iraqi officials have classified it as effectively outside Baghdad, so no exception to the agreement needs to be granted, in their view.\nCombat troops with the Seventh Field Artillery Regiment will remain in the heart of Baghdad at Camp Prosperity, located near the new American Embassy compound in the Green Zone. In addition to providing a quick reaction force, guarding the embassy and noncombat troops from attack, those soldiers will also continue to support Iraqi troops who are now in nominal charge of maintaining security in the Green Zone.\nThe details of troop withdrawals and the transfer of facilities are negotiated by the Joint Military Operations Coordinating Committee, led by the top American commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno, and the Iraqi defense minister, Abdul Qadir al-Obaidi. At its meeting on Monday, the committee will discuss a host of transfer issues, as well as whether to grant any exceptions to the June 30 deadline, and it will make recommendations to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki for a final decision.\nThe spokesman for the Iraqi military, Maj. Gen. Muhammad al-Askari, who is also the secretary to the committee\u2019s Iraqi contingent, said also that a decision on Mosul would be made at Monday\u2019s meeting, which he called \u201ccritical.\u201d\n\u201cI personally think even in Mosul there will be no American forces in the city, but that\u2019s a decision for the Iraqi government and the Iraqi prime minister,\u201d General Askari said.\nGeneral Perkins also expressed specific concerns about Mosul, noting how important the city is to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the homegrown group that American intelligence officials say is led by foreigners.\n\u201cFor Al Qaeda to win, they have to take Baghdad. To survive they have to hold on to Mosul,\u201d he said. \u201cMosul is sort of their last area where they have some maybe at least passive support.\u201d\nIn Baghdad, whether combat troops remain in the city may well be a function of how they are defined, as well as where the city limits lie.\nThe Camp Victory complex includes Camps Victory, Liberty, Striker and Slayer, plus the prison known as Camp Cropper, where so-called high-value prisoners are kept. It also includes the military side of Baghdad International Airport.\nGeneral Askari emphatically said that the June 30 provision did not apply to the Camp Victory complex because it was effectively outside the city. General Askari also said having American combat troops at Camp Prosperity would not violate the terms of the agreement, because they are there for force protection and to guard the nearby embassy.\n\u201cIf there is a small group to stay in that camp to guard the American Embassy, that\u2019s no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe meaning of the SOFA is that their vehicles cannot go in the streets of Baghdad and interfere with our job.\u201d\nThe Green Zone was handed over to Iraqi control Jan. 1, when the agreement went into effect. In addition to the United States-Iraqi patrols, most of the security for the Green Zone\u2019s many checkpoints and heavily guarded entry points is still done by the same private contractors who did it prior to Jan. 1.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is not a change in the numbers, it\u2019s a doctrine change,\u201d said First Sgt. David Moore, a New Jersey National Guardsman with the Joint Area Support Group, which runs the Green Zone. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to have fighters. Every U.S. soldier is trained to fight.\u201d\nOne of the Green Zone\u2019s biggest bases, Forward Operating Base Freedom, was handed back to Iraqi control on April 1, at least most of it. The United States military kept the swimming pool.\nIn addition to troops, Camp Prosperity will house many American contractors and other personnel. Next door, at Camp Union III, the military is in the process of setting up housing for several thousand soldiers, trainers and advisers working for the Multi-National Security Transition Command, which now has its headquarters elsewhere in the Green Zone.\nWhile those principal Baghdad bases will remain, the United States military has been rapidly erasing its footprint everywhere else in Baghdad. The so-called troop surge added 77 small bases, known as combat outposts, patrol bases and joint security stations, spread throughout the city\u2019s neighborhoods to get United States troops closer to the people. At the height, in 2007, there were nearly 100 such bases. All of them will have been turned over to the Iraqis by June 30, and many already have been, General Perkins said. He added that in many cases the Iraqis would choose not to use them for their own troops.\nNationwide, the American military presence is also changing quickly as June 30 approaches. A survey of northern and central Iraqi provinces by New York Times reporters confirmed that American troops had already withdrawn from all of the bases situated in the centers of major towns or cities, with the exception of Mosul.\nGeneral Perkins said that American combat forces had already been drawing down steadily in Iraq\u2019s cities, replaced by Iraqi troops. By September 2008, the number of American troops in Iraq had dropped by about 20 percent from the peak during the so-called troop surge in 2007, he said. An additional 8,000 left by the end of January.\nAs of April 17, there were 137,934 American service members in Iraq, according to Lt. Col. Amy Hannah, a public affairs officer. An additional 16,000 will go by September, General Perkins said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose the gains we\u2019ve had so far,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to rush to failure here. This isn\u2019t just, we\u2019re going home. We\u2019re just moving.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have soldiers trained in combat skills in the city,\u201d General Perkins said. Trainers and advisers can stay, under the terms of the agreement, and combat troops can re-enter on operations if invited by the Iraqis, he said.\nGeneral Perkins gave the example of sending the 82nd Airborne Division to help with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. \u201cThe 82nd are combat troops, but that was not a combat mission,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/world/middleeast/27withdraw.html", "title": "Exceptions to Iraq Deadline Are Proposed", "author": "ROD NORDLAND"}
{"date": "Sun, 15 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 The religious order banning women from dressing like tomboys was bad enough. But the fatwa by this country\u2019s leading clerics against yoga was the last straw.\n\u201cThey have never even done yoga,\u201d said Zainah Anwar, a founder of a Malaysian women\u2019s rights group called Sisters in Islam.\nMs. Anwar argues that the edict, issued late last year by the National Fatwa Council of Malaysia, is pure patriarchy. Islam, she says, is only a cover.\nIt was frustrations like those that drew several hundred Muslim women to a conference in this Muslim-majority country over the weekend. Their mission was to come up with ways to demand equal rights for women. And their tools, however unlikely, were the tenets of Islam itself.\n\u201cSecular feminism has fulfilled its historical role, but it has nothing more to give us,\u201d said Ziba Mir-Hosseini, an Iranian anthropologist who has been helping to formulate some of the arguments. \u201cThe challenge we face now is theological.\u201d\nThe advocates came from 47 countries to participate in the project, called Musawah, the Arabic word for equality. They spent the weekend brainstorming and learning the best Islamic arguments to take back to their own societies as defenses against clerics who insist that women\u2019s lives are dictated by men\u2019s strict interpretations of Islam.\n\u201cWe are trying to develop a new language, offer it to the world and use it,\u201d said Marwa Sharafeldin, an activist from Egypt.\nMs. Anwar, the main organizer, said her group was almost alone when she started it 20 years ago, but now it is one of many. \u201cIt\u2019s a movement whose time has come.\u201d\nThe repression comes not from the Koran, the women argue, but from the human interpretation of it, in the form of Islamic law, which has ossified over the centuries while their globalized lives have galloped ahead. So they are going back to the original text, arguing that its emphasis on justice makes the case for equality.\n\u201cFeminist Islamic scholarship is trying to unearth the facts that were there,\u201d Ms. Mir-Hosseini told a room of eager activists Sunday. \u201cWe can\u2019t be afraid to look at legal tradition critically.\u201d\nShe referred to the work of Muslim intellectuals, like Nasr Abu Zayd of Egypt and Abdolkarim Soroush of Iran, reformers who argue that the Koran must be read in a historical context, and that laws derived from it can change with the times. Their ideas are controversial, and both are in exile in the West.\nMs. Mir-Hosseini argues that Muslim societies are trapped in a battle between two visions of Islam: one legalistic and absolutist that emphasizes the past; the other pluralistic and more inclined toward democracy. She said that in Iran reformers were gaining ground, but that President Bush\u2019s antagonism toward the country ended up strengthening hard-liners there.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a struggle between two world views,\u201d she said, adding that time was on the side of the women.\nIt was the rise of political Islam that brought the women together. As Malaysia\u2019s progressive family laws began to be rolled back in the late 1980s, Ms. Anwar and several other women formed a Koran reading group.\n\u201cThere is an understanding that mullahs know best, that you cannot speak,\u201d Ms. Anwar said. \u201cMuslim women\u2019s groups are coming out to challenge that authority.\u201d\nSome scholars argued that the effort sounded unrealistic and would have no impact, mainly because it appeared to ignore more than a thousand years of Islamic legal scholarship and practice. Religious authorities are the only ones with the power to interpret laws, and circumventing that well-entrenched system would require replacing it altogether.\n\u201cThis kind of argument is being made at the margins of the Islamic world,\u201d said Bernard Haykel, an expert on Islamic law at Princeton University. \u201cIt has shape and form, but no substantive content. There\u2019s no real way of actually bringing about these changes.\u201d\nBut others made the case that change, though incremental, was happening at the grass-roots level in a number of Muslim societies. Isobel Coleman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who attended the conference, argues that women\u2019s movements are making progress, as girls\u2019 education levels increase and the Western world is a click away on satellite television. Women are even taking positions in religious institutions, she said: a woman has headed the Shariah College at Qatar University.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slow shift,\u201d said Ms. Coleman, whose book on the topic, \u201cParadise Beneath Her Feet: Women and Reform in the Middle East,\u201d is to be published by Random House in 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s just beginning to come together as a movement.\u201d\nThere have been some successes. In Morocco, sweeping changes of family law in favor of women went into effect in 2004. Critics argued that it was possible only because the country\u2019s king approved it, but Moroccan activists said it never would have happened if they had not spent years lobbying and formulating legal arguments, some of them based on Islamic tenets.\nThat has had ripple effects. Elaheh Koolaee, a professor from the University of Tehran who formerly served in Iran\u2019s Parliament, said that Iranian women had been watching the Moroccan example and that a Muslim success was an invaluable tool. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to show positive experiences from within Muslim societies that are not from the U.S. or Europe,\u201d she said.\nMs. Mir-Hosseini said she believed that change was coming, and that it was just a matter of when.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much tension and energy there now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be a flood.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/world/asia/16women.html", "title": "In Quest for Equal Rights, Muslim Women\u2019s Meeting Turns to Islam\u2019s Tenets", "author": "SABRINA TAVERNISE"}

{"date": "Sat, 20 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 With Mexico\u2019s midterm elections two weeks away, the most spirited campaigning has been for a candidate with no name, no face and no particular policy positions. Call him Nulo.\nNulo \u2014 Spanish for null and void \u2014 is drawing support from disgruntled Mexicans who say the country\u2019s politicians are focused more on their own power games than on the people they are supposed to serve. So, instead of urging voters to throw their weight behind any of the real candidates vying to be elected mayors, governors or members of Congress on July 5, Nulo\u2019s backers are calling on Mexicans to nullify their ballots \u2014 and vote for no one at all.\n\u201cThere have been campaigns like this in the past, but it\u2019s never caught fire,\u201d said Daniel Lund, president of the MUND Group, a Mexico City polling firm. \u201cNow, it\u2019s catching fire.\u201d\nSupport for the Voto Nulo campaign has spread on the Internet, where supporters extol the virtues of sending Mexican political parties a stark message: Voting for nothing is better than backing the politicians currently running the country.\nMexico was essentially a one-party state until 2000, when the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, finally lost its grip on the presidency. But a sense of frustration has developed in recent years as more choices on the ballot have not, in the minds of many Mexicans, translated into a more responsive government.\nThe country is now in the midst of a particularly rough patch. The economy is in the doldrums, hit hard by the financial crisis in the United States. Political corruption is regarded as being as bad as ever, a point highlighted recently by the arrests of several mayors accused of consorting with drug traffickers. And insecurity remains a constant worry, despite the anticrime offensive being waged by President Felipe Calder\u00f3n.\nJust how much support Nulo will receive is unclear, although the Federal Election Institute, the public body that oversees the voting, has taken it seriously enough to put forward a counter campaign, and seven of the eight political parties in Mexico City gathered the other day to argue against the Nulo effort.\nPolitical analysts say about 2.5 percent of the ballots cast in any Mexican election are nullified, most unintentionally. With the Nulo campaign seeming to gain support by the day, spoiled ballots next month are expected to be higher \u2014 from 5 percent of the voters to significantly more, according to various estimates.\nBut there is a great difference of opinion on what effect even strong support for Nulo will have, since under Mexican voting rules, Nulo cannot win.\nStrong support could embarrass the candidates, supporters say, and send a message to the parties now controlling Mexican politics that they need to change. Luis Manuel P\u00e9rez de Acha, a lawyer who is spearheading www.votaenblanco.org.mx, one of the main Nulo campaign sites, wants voters to mark their ballots in a special way, first by drawing a giant circle to represent the nation\u2019s citizens and then marking it with a big X to symbolize support for them.\nDetractors of the Nulo campaign counter that those spoiling their ballots are doing damage to democracy and allowing other voters to decide who will govern them.\n\u201cThose who lose if we don\u2019t respect institutions and don\u2019t go to vote are future generations,\u201d August\u00edn Llamas Mendoza, a political analyst at Pan-American University, wrote in a recent newspaper commentary.\nRavi Singh, an Internet consultant from the United States who is helping several Mexican candidates with their online campaigning, described the Nulo effort to an American reporter as \u201cunpatriotic\u201d and \u201clike a bunch of babies crying.\u201d\nSome of Nulo\u2019s backers have not always been so turned off by politics. One of the biggest names to join the Nulo cause is Dulce Mar\u00eda Sauri, a former governor, a member of Congress and a leader of the PRI.\nParty leaders prevented her from appearing on the ballot next month, which seems to have turned her against her former profession to set off on her own Internet campaign backing Nulo.\nExperts do not expect a surge by Nulo to significantly change the distribution of support for the various parties. The PRI has been leading in most polls, followed by Mr. Calder\u00f3n\u2019s National Action Party and, in a distant third place, the left-leaning Democratic Revolution Party.\nWith Nulo\u2019s campaign getting the kind of buzz candidates desire, other creative protest efforts have sprung up. Some are pushing for voters to write in figures from the country\u2019s past, like Pancho Villa, a revolutionary leader, or Benito Ju\u00e1rez, a beloved president from the 19th century.\nTurnout is typically low for Mexico\u2019s midterm elections, which take place every three years, and some polls suggest that as many as 60 percent of voters will stay home next month, supporting none of the real candidates and not Nulo, either.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/world/americas/21mexico.html", "title": "Disgruntled Mexicans Plan an Election Message to Politicians: We Prefer Nobody", "author": "MARC LACEY"}
{"date": "Fri, 25 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 One year after a financial crisis that began in the United States tipped the world into a severe recession, leaders from both rich countries and fast-growing powerhouses like China agreed on Friday to a far-reaching effort to revamp the economic system.\nThe agreements, if carried out by national governments, would lead to much tighter regulation over financial institutions, complex financial instruments and executive pay. They could also lead to big changes and more outside scrutiny over the economic strategies of individual countries, including the United States.\n\u201cWe have achieved a level of tangible, global economic cooperation that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d President Obama said shortly after the summit meeting of 20 leading economies concluded here. \u201cOur financial system will be far different and more secure than the one that failed so dramatically last year.\u201d\nThe leaders pledged to rethink their economic policies in a coordinated effort to reduce the immense imbalances between export-dominated countries like China and Japan and debt-laden countries like the United States, which has long been the world\u2019s most willing consumer.\nThe United States will be expected to increase its savings rate, reduce its trade deficit and address its huge budget deficit. Countries like China, Japan and Germany will be expected to reduce their dependence on exports by promoting more consumer spending and investment at home.\nThe ideas are not new, and there is no enforcement mechanism to penalize countries if they stick to their old habits. But for the first time ever, each country agreed to submit its policies to a \u201cpeer review\u201d from the other governments as well as to monitoring by the International Monetary Fund.\nThat in itself would be a big change, given how prickly national leaders have often been toward outside criticism of their policies. American officials, who pushed for the plan during weeks of negotiations before the summit meeting, argued that governments were so shocked by the economic crisis that they were willing to rethink what was in their self-interest.\n\u201cI\u2019m quite impressed,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who had initially been skeptical about the proposed \u201cframework\u201d for stable growth. \u201cA commitment by the U.S. to take the process seriously is a potential game-changer that would give the framework some credibility.\u201d\nThe outcome was revealed the same day the leaders formally announced that discussions about global economic issues would shift permanently from the Group of 7 big industrial nations \u2014 the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Italy, Germany and Japan \u2014 to the Group of 20, which includes China, India, Brazil, South Korea and South Africa, reflecting the increased clout of fast-growing developing nations in the global economy.\nThe decision reflected both symbolic and practical needs. Poorer but fast-growing nations have long complained that their influence on global policy has lagged behind their economic role. As a practical matter, China and other developing countries played a central role in fighting the global downturn by undertaking aggressive stimulus programs in concert with the United States and Europe.\nAmerican officials had been negotiating with their foreign counterparts for months before the summit meeting, and the agreements endorsed on Friday were mostly pledges rather than binding commitments.\nOne of the most important elements of the agreement calls on the Group of 20 countries to require higher levels of capital at banks and other financial institutions. The goal is to reduce risk-taking by forcing institutions to keep bigger reserves as a buffer against unexpected losses or disruptions in credit markets.\nThe Group of 20 communiqu\u00e9 outlines a long set of principles for tougher rules, and governments pledged to develop \u201cinternationally agreed\u201d regulations by the end of 2010.\nBut the communiqu\u00e9 includes no specific numbers on how high capital reserves should be, and there are big disagreements over that issue.\nFrench and German banks generally have lower capital reserves than their American rivals, and European officials have complained that their banks could be at a disadvantage because they would have to set aside more money to meet new requirements. Japanese officials have warned that they need to pursue their own approach, contending that Japanese banks are inherently more conservative than American banks.\nSimilarly, American and French officials disagreed before the summit meeting on how to clamp down on executive pay. Officials on both sides agreed that executive bonuses contributed to the financial crisis by rewarding short-term performance without regard to longer-term risks. But French officials wanted to impose specific caps on bonuses, perhaps based on a percentage of a bank\u2019s profits.\nAmerican and British officials thought specific caps were too rigid, and pushed for rules that would defer the payout of bonuses for several years and reduce the incentive for people to take short-term gambles. The American view prevailed, but that does not preclude governments from imposing tighter restrictions.\nFor all the unanswered questions, the final communiqu\u00e9 covered an extraordinary number of complex financial issues. The leaders agreed, for example, to devise policies by the end of 2010 for closing troubled financial institutions that were considered \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d They also agreed on the need to regulate financial derivatives, endorsing the approach proposed by the Obama administration in its bill to overhaul the regulatory system.\nThey also renewed their vow to give China and other Asian nations a bigger share of the vote at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Asian countries have long complained that their stakes no longer reflect their financial contributions.\nIn another nod to developing countries, the leaders agreed to revive talks to reach a new global trade agreement by the end of 2010 that would, among other things, reduce barriers to agricultural exports. The goal may be optimistic: the Obama administration has shown no enthusiasm for new trade deals, and many Democrats want to see more protections rather than fewer.\nThe big question is whether the Group of 20 will be more effective because it includes important new players like India and Brazil, or whether it will simply be more unwieldy.\nAmerican officials acknowledged that the economic crisis crystallized priorities of countries with normally conflicting agendas in ways that occur only rarely in normal times. But they said they were betting that individual governments would see their self-interest as more tied than before to the stability of the rest of the world.\n\u201cThe announcement today is more than symbolic,\u201d said Robert M. Kimmitt, who served as deputy Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush. \u201cThe fact that leaders are turning to the strategic challenge and doing it in a coordinated way at the level of the Group of 20 is significant.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/world/26summit.html", "title": "Leaders of G-20 Vow to Reshape Global Economy", "author": "EDMUND L.

{"date": "Wed, 08 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "L\u2019AQUILA, Italy \u2014 President Obama has enlisted the world\u2019s leading powers to contribute $15 billion to help millions of the world\u2019s poorest farmers grow enough food to feed themselves, American officials said Wednesday.\nIf the assistance is delivered and is in fact mostly new money, it will constitute the largest international effort in decades to combat hunger by investing in the fundamentals of an agricultural economy, including seed, fertilizer, grain storage and research into new plant varieties.\nWith the ranks of the hungry expected to exceed a billion people this year, the undertaking has great urgency for the bulk of the world\u2019s poor who still live in rural areas.\nAnd it also signals a major change in the United States\u2019 own approach to hunger, which has relied far more on shipping American-grown food to the starving than on helping them grow their own.\nThis aid package effectively recognizes the growing consensus among philanthropists, economists and African governments that efforts to reduce poverty on the continent are probably doomed without far greater investment in agriculture. While aid to educate the poor and keep them healthy is critical, so is helping millions of farmers grow more food and earn some income.\nMr. Obama, who has made improving the productivity of farmers in the developing world a top priority since taking office, lobbied other world leaders to join him in backing this venture during telephone conversations in recent weeks. Leaders from Italy and Japan, among others, also took the lead in forging a consensus. The resulting commitments, to be unveiled Friday, may be among the most tangible achievements of his first summit meeting with the Group of 8 powers, here in L\u2019Aquila.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need fancy computers to solve these problems,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a recent interview with allAfrica.com, which distributes news from across the continent. \u201cWe need tried-and-true agricultural methods and technologies that are cheap and are efficient but could have a huge impact in terms of people\u2019s day-to-day well-being.\u201d\nThe $15 billion, to be spent over three years, would come from the United States and the other Group of 8 members: Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Canada and Japan. They have promised to better coordinate their efforts to avoid a mismatched quilt of programs, with the World Bank in a pivotal role.\nWithout the details of the financing from each country, it is hard to gauge the actual scale of the new package. Some of the promised aid seems likely to be old money counted as new. An Obama administration official, Michael Froman, said after a briefing on Wednesday that all the United States\u2019 agricultural assistance was being counted as \u201cnew money\u201d because the administration could have chosen to spend nothing.\nStill, the amount of global aid now given to agriculture, about $5 billion a year, is so low that advocates and charity leaders said the infusion of new money was substantial, even as they insisted that they would need to study the fine print to measure just how significant it would be.\n\u201cThis is a major initiative and will mark a turning point in the hunger challenge,\u201d said Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Columbia University economist who has long campaigned for increased aid to farmers. \u201cFor more than 20 years there was not only a neglect of agriculture, but a reliance on shipping emergency food aid.\u201d\nMr. Obama announced in April that he was asking Congress to double American financial support for agricultural growth in developing countries to more than $1 billion a year in 2010. The American share of the $15 billion Group of 8 program would be $3.5 billion over three years, a sum that includes what the United States already spends annually.\nA draft statement said the new program \u201cdiffers from previous approaches first because we will coordinate at country, regional and global levels and commit to work as partners with all stakeholders.\u201d Also, the statement said, \u201cit is focused squarely on agriculture development, which has for long been neglected.\u201d\nAndrew S. Natsios, who led the United States Agency for International Development under President George W. Bush, said, \u201cIt\u2019s better late than never.\u201d Mr. Natsios, long a frustrated advocate for agricultural aid, said: \u201cMost of the poorest people in the world are farmers and herders who live in rural areas. Unless you address agriculture, all development programs will be unsustainable.\u201d\nAid for agriculture plummeted by 75 percent from the late 1980s to the early 1990s and remained at a low level, according to a June report by Oxfam International, the aid organization. The amount only recently began creeping up to about $5 billion in 2007.\nBut the issue did not gain real political traction until last year, when soaring food prices caused a growing number of people to go hungry and contributed to food riots in more than 30 countries.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what made everybody sit up and say, \u2018We can\u2019t just ignore this,\u2019 \u201d said Julie Howard, executive director of the Partnership to Cut Hunger and Poverty in Africa, based in Washington.\nThe worsening global economy this year has pushed even more people into poverty. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that the number of hungry people will grow by almost 100 million this year, reversing a four-decade downward trend.\nSome aid experts, like Dr. Helene D. Gayle, president of CARE, the international group, are optimistic about efforts to help poor farmers. Many groups like hers have been working in the countryside for years, hampered by a shortage of money. \u201cWe\u2019re not starting from scratch,\u201d she said.\nProfessor Sachs points to the success of Malawi, in southern Africa, which sharply raised food production by providing widespread subsidies for fertilizer.\u201cYou can double, even triple or quadruple food production from one growing season to the next by enabling small-holder farmers to get access to high-yielding seeds, fertilizer and agricultural extension services,\u201d he said.\nBut William Easterly, a New York University economist, said Mr. Obama should study the past to avoid repeating it.\nRobert S. McNamara, the former World Bank president who died Monday, undertook the last great push for investment in African agriculture in the 1970s. Evaluations found that many of those projects failed. They were too complicated. They relied too heavily on Western experts.

{"date": "Mon, 14 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 A High Court judge on Monday imposed minimum prison terms of 32 to 40 years on three men convicted last week, after two trials, of plotting to smuggle liquid explosives onto at least seven trans-Atlantic airliners heading to the United States and Canada from London, with the aim of blowing the aircraft apart in midair.\nThe judge, Sir Richard Henriques, called the plot \u201cthe most grave and wicked conspiracy ever proven within this jurisdiction\u201d and compared it, in its potential for inflicting mass loss of life, to the Sept. 11 attacks. He gave all three men the maximum of life imprisonment but followed standard British practice by specifying the minimum period each man would have to serve before becoming eligible for parole.\nThe plot\u2019s ringleader in Britain, Abdulla Ahmed Ali, 28, was given a minimum term of 40 years. Assad Sarwar, 29, received a 36-year minimum after he was identified at the trials as the chemical expert and \u201cquartermaster\u201d of the plot, responsible for acquiring materials, including the explosive concentration of hydrogen peroxide that would have been injected into plastic soft-drink bottles intended to serve as bombs.\nA third man, Tanvir Hussain, 28, named by prosecutors as Mr. Ali\u2019s right-hand man, was told that he would have to serve at least 32 years.\nJudge Henriques, 65, known in the British judiciary for his tough sentencing in an era when the trend has often been toward greater leniency, was unsparing as he passed sentences on the plotters, saying they had amassed enough explosives to make 20 bombs. He aligned himself squarely with the prosecutors, who were faced with defense arguments that the plotters had intended only to set off minor explosions at a terminal at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport to attract attention to Muslim grievances over the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and not to kill people or attack airliners.\n\u201cThe intention was to perpetrate a terrorist outrage that would stand alongside the events of Sept. 11, 2001, in history,\u201d the judge said. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied that the plot would have succeeded but for the intervention of the police and the security service.\u201d He added, \u201cHad this conspiracy not been interrupted, a massive loss of life would almost certainly have resulted \u2014 and if the detonation was over land, the number of victims would have been even greater still.\u201d\nAs the judge passed sentence at Woolwich Crown Court in south London on Mr. Ali, the plot leader, he glanced down at a small book he was holding but was otherwise expressionless, the BBC reported. The BBC reporter said that Mr. Sarwar and Mr. Hussain were similarly undemonstrative. The reporter did not identify the book held by Mr. Ali.\nThe sentences, among the harshest ever imposed in Britain in a murder plot in which nobody was killed, seemed likely to ease the sometimes severe strains that had developed between the United States and Britain over the case. The friction was compounded when the five other defendants in the trial were acquitted of plotting to bomb airliners; one of the five, Umar Islam, 31, was convicted on the lesser charge of conspiracy to commit murder.\nAnother of the five, Donald Stewart-Whyte, 23, was acquitted on both charges, but the jury did not reach a verdict on the murder conspiracy charge against the remaining three, and they will learn after a hearing on Oct. 5 whether they will face a third trial on the charge.\nGlobal interest in the case, which ran for 17 months over the course of the two trials, has been high, partly because discovery of the plot in August 2006 led to worldwide, time-consuming restrictions at airport security checkpoints that are still in place on the liquids and creams passengers can carry aboard aircraft.\nAmerican involvement was pervasive from the start and led to bitter confrontations between officials in London and Washington \u2014 not least when the first trial ended last September with the jury convicting Mr. Ali, Mr. Sarwar and Mr. Hussain of conspiracy to commit murder but not reaching a verdict on the main charge of plotting to attack airliners, an outcome some American and British officials attributed to poor handling of the prosecution\u2019s case.\nThere was also unease over the fact that British courts, unlike their American counterparts, do not allow the use of electronic intercepts as evidence, voiding for court purposes extensive recordings of telephone conversations in which the plotters discussed their plans.\nMr. Islam, the fourth man convicted of a charge last week, received a 22-year term for conspiracy to murder. He had been declared not guilty of the aircraft bombing charge after the jury concluded he was not aware that aircraft were the targets.\nAll four men sentenced on Monday and the three men facing the possibility of a third trial \u2014 Ibrahim Savant, 28; Arafat Waheed Khan, 28; and Waheed Zaman, 25 \u2014 are British citizens with family ties in Pakistan, where prosecutors said the plot was masterminded by a British-born man with Pakistani origins, Rashid Rauf.\nMr. Rauf\u2019s involvement was another flashpoint between American and British officials investigating the plot. It was his arrest in Pakistan \u2014 at the urging of American officials, as British intelligence officers have said \u2014 that set off a chain reaction that prompted the British authorities to round up the plotters on Aug. 9, 2006, at a time when British investigators thought that they lacked enough evidence to guarantee successful prosecutions.\nMr. Rauf\u2019s role in the case threatened at one point to turn into farce. Known as an alcohol-drinking troublemaker at school, he fled Britain in 2002 when his uncle was brutally murdered in Birmingham and he was identified as a suspect. British intelligence officials have said he may have had links to the London transit bombings in 2005 in which 56 people, including four suicide bombers, were killed.\nAfter his arrest in Pakistan in 2006, Britain sought his extradition in the airliner bombing case but he escaped from Pakistani police officers. American officials have said he was eventually killed in a missile strike in northern Pakistan last November.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/world/europe/15london.html", "title": "Life Terms for Plot to Bomb Trans-Atlantic Flights From London", "author": "JOHN F.

{"date": "Thu, 17 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama scrapped his predecessor\u2019s proposed antiballistic missile shield in Eastern Europe on Thursday and ordered instead the development of a reconfigured system designed to shoot down short- and medium-range Iranian missiles.\nIn one of the biggest national security reversals of his young presidency, Mr. Obama canceled former President George W. Bush\u2019s plans to station a radar facility in the Czech Republic and 10 ground-based interceptors in Poland. Instead, he plans to deploy smaller SM-3 interceptors by 2011, first aboard ships and later in Europe, possibly even in Poland or the Czech Republic.\nMr. Obama said that the new system \u201cwill provide stronger, smarter and swifter defenses of American forces and America\u2019s allies\u201d to meet a changing threat from Iran. Administration officials cited what they called accumulating evidence that Iran had made more progress than anticipated in building short- and medium-range missiles that could threaten Israel and Europe than it had in developing the intercontinental missiles that the Bush system was more suited to counter.\nBut the decision churned domestic and international politics as Republican critics at home accused Mr. Obama of betraying allies and caving in to Russian pressure, while officials in Eastern Europe expressed discomfort and confusion at the dramatic shift. President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, who is to meet with Mr. Obama in New York next week, reacted cautiously as Moscow tried to determine whether the new system was less threatening to its own security.\nMr. Obama\u2019s transformation of the missile defense program is one of his administration\u2019s sharpest revisions of the national security policy he inherited from Mr. Bush. At the same time, he resisted pressure from liberals in his party to eliminate the program altogether and he produced an alternative that effectively guaranteed that the United States would deploy some form of European antimissile shield in the near future.\n\u201cPresident Bush was right that Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program poses a significant threat,\u201d Mr. Obama said. But he said the new assessment of the Iranian threat required a different system using existing technology. \u201cThis new approach will provide capabilities sooner, build on proven systems and offer greater defenses against the threat of missile attack than the 2007 European missile defense program,\u201d he said.\nThe White House adamantly denied that its decision had anything to do with Russian objections to Mr. Bush\u2019s program and said that the United States would continue developing the larger interceptors in case it eventually needed to deploy them. The administration also scrambled to reassure Poland and the Czech Republic that it was not abandoning them.\nMr. Obama called the leaders of both nations to reaffirm what he called \u201cour deep and close ties,\u201d and publicly reiterated America\u2019s commitment under Article 5 of the NATO treaty to come to their defense in the event of an attack. Aides said that Mr. Obama would keep Mr. Bush\u2019s promise to provide a Patriot antimissile battery to Poland.\nYet even as it sought to calm Warsaw and Prague, the administration hoped to use the policy change to mitigate Israel\u2019s desire to take military action against Iran\u2019s nuclear complexes as Iran comes closer to building a warhead and mounting it on a missile. \u201cWe hope that it will reassure them that perhaps there\u2019s a little more time here,\u201d Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said of the Israelis.\nThe decision drew immediate Republican criticism. \u201cScrapping the U.S. missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic does little more than empower Russia and Iran at the expense of our allies in Europe,\u201d said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader. \u201cIt shows a willful determination to continue ignoring the threat posed by some of the most dangerous regimes in the world.\u201d\nEric S. Edelman, the under secretary of defense under Mr. Bush, said in an interview that the decision had \u201cgood news and bad news.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s better, obviously, to have some missile defense capability there now,\u201d he said. But he said the move would \u201craise questions\u201d about American commitments and make it harder for the United States to change course if Iran later developed longer-range missiles. \u201cThere are going to be enormous repercussions to this decision that will ripple out,\u201d he said.\nMr. Obama stressed that Mr. Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff supported the decision, and he sent Mr. Gates, a Republican first appointed by Mr. Bush, to discuss the decision with reporters. Mr. Gates said that the new system would put defenses in place seven years earlier than the Bush plan. While no longer deploying the original interceptors in Poland, the United States \u201cwould prefer to put the SM-3s in Poland,\u201d Mr. Gates said.\n\u201cThose who say we are scrapping missile defense in Europe are either misinformed or misrepresenting the reality of what we are doing,\u201d Mr. Gates said. He added that the new configuration \u201cprovides a better missile defense capability\u201d for Europe and American forces \u201cthan the program I recommended almost three years ago.\u201d\nMr. Gates and other officials said Iran was moving quickly toward a workable arsenal of missiles that could strike Israel and Europe. In May, Iran launched the Sejil-2, a successful test of a two-stage solid-fuel missile with an estimated range of 1,200 miles. Unlike Iran\u2019s liquid-fuel missiles, a solid-fuel missile can be stored, moved and fired on shorter notice, and thus is considered a greater threat.\nThe administration\u2019s new four-phase plan would deploy existing SM-3 interceptors using the sea-based Aegis system in 2011, then deploy an improved version in 2015 both on ships and on land. Rather than the 10 bigger interceptors originally envisioned for Poland, there could be 40 to 50 of the smaller missiles on land by then and more on ships. A more advanced version would be deployed in 2018 and yet another generation in 2020, the latter with more capacity to counter intercontinental missiles.\nThe interceptors Mr. Bush wanted to put in Poland would not have been deployed until 2018, officials said. The SM-3 missiles have had eight successful tests so far, and were used to shoot down a satellite, although critics said the missiles have not had to cope with the sort of decoys enemies might use. Instead of the sophisticated radar proposed for the Czech Republic, officials said they would rely more on a limited version in Turkey or the Caucasus, as well as satellites and newly developed airborne sensors.\nIn Moscow, Mr. Medvedev offered a measured reaction. \u201cWe appreciate the responsible approach of the U.S. president toward implementing our agreements,\u201d he said on national television. \u201cI am prepared to continue this dialogue.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/world/europe/18shield.html", "title": "White House Scraps Bush\u2019s Approach to Missile Shield", "author": "PETER BAKER"}
{"date": "Mon, 09 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "RAMADI, Iraq \u2014 The postelection curfew has been lifted, the threats of violence muted after the intervention of envoys from the Iraqi Army, the central government and the United States Marines. A cacophonous bustle has returned to the filthy, shattered streets of this provincial capital, once a base of the Sunni insurgency.\nAnd still Faris Taha, one of the election\u2019s victors, according to preliminary results, is too fearful to return to the region he will soon represent.\n\u201cI cannot go back,\u201d he said, having retreated from his hometown east of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, to a hotel in Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone. \u201cI am afraid.\u201d\nIraq\u2019s provincial elections on Jan. 31 passed with strikingly little mayhem, raising hopes that democracy might take hold. But in Anbar, as in other volatile provinces, the results that were supposed to augur peace have instead fueled tensions, raising the specter of violence among those vying for political power.\nThe transition from insurgency to politics to governance \u2014 a key to stabilizing the country after six years of war \u2014 has proved to be anything but steady and sure. What Anbar has yet to experience is the foundation of any democracy: a peaceful transfer of power. Seating the new provincial governments, Iraqi and American officials fear, could be even more fraught with danger than the elections themselves.\nFrom Basra in the south to Mosul in the north, at least four candidates have faced assassination attempts since Election Day, while another disappeared on his way to work near Karbala. The divided results in Anbar, where no bloc won more than 17.6 percent of the vote, have led to conflicting accusations of intimidation, assault and fraud; a raft of complaints to the central election commission could take months to sort out.\nEfforts to forge a ruling coalition, already under way behind the scenes, are exposing tribal rivalries and personal feuds. Most of the incumbents have decamped from the region they have governed since 2005.\n\u201cWe were born yesterday when it comes to politics,\u201d said Sheik Ali al-Hatem, who backed the Tribes of Iraq coalition, which is challenging its 4.5 percent showing in the vote.\nThe outcome in Anbar, the vast Sunni-dominated region west of Baghdad, has enormous significance for Iraq\u2019s political development. It was once the most dangerous province in Iraq, consumed by a bloody insurgency and terrorism, until tribal leaders joined the Americans and turned on Al Qaeda and other extremists in late 2006. They pacified the region and made plans to consolidate their power at the ballot box.\nWhat stunned Iraqi officials was how quickly after the vote some of the tribal leaders returned to the language of war when the elections\u2019 outcome disappointed them.\nEven before the results were announced, the leader of the party now known as the Awakening, Sheik Ahmed Abu Risha, threatened to turn his followers into an \u201carmed wing\u201d to overthrow the provincial government. The head of the Tribes of Iraq bloc, Sheik Hammid al-Hayes, threatened to set the streets of Ramadi ablaze and turn the province into a graveyard.\nTheir fury stemmed from initial claims by the governing party, the Iraqi Islamic Party, to have swept Anbar\u2019s election, as it did in 2005 when most Sunnis boycotted the vote.\nInstead, the Islamic Party stood accused of stuffing ballot boxes and reporting inflated results from some polling stations. Party leaders denied any fraud, though one foreign election observer said the complaints had some legitimacy. The central election commission rejected some ballots before announcing preliminary results in Baghdad last Thursday, party officials said.\n\u201cThe Islamic Party does not deserve even 1 percent of the vote in Anbar,\u201d said another sheik, Aifan al-Issawi, who ran on the Awakening Party slate in the region\u2019s other major city, Falluja. \u201cThey have blood on their hands, and they have plundered the province.\u201d\nPrime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki swiftly sent one of his deputies, Rafie al-Issawi, a Sunni from the province, to defuse the crisis. The commander of Iraq\u2019s army, Lt. Gen. Ali Ghaidan Majid, vowed to put down any violence. The envoys appeared to have secured a truce of sorts, but a final resolution remains out of reach.\nIn Ramadi, the leader of the Awakening Party, Sheik Ahmed, now tempers his remarks. Sitting in his tribal guest house not far from the Euphrates River, surrounded by guards, police officers, soldiers, relatives, friends and other hangers-on, the sheik spoke confidently of forging a governing coalition that would exclude the Islamic Party.\nOn the wall are photographs of him with President Bush at the White House and with the current president, Barack Obama, from his visit to the region as a candidate last year, evidence of the American sponsorship of the Awakening movement. As he spoke, his brother arrived, wearing a gun belt with cartridges and a gold-plated pistol.\nWhile Sheik Ahmed did not recant his earlier threats of violence, he vowed that their struggle would remain a political one.\n\u201cWe are armed by papers and evidence,\u201d he said of his party\u2019s official complaints, \u201cand paper is the strongest weapon. That is the weapon we will use.\u201d\nA new provincial council is supposed to be seated by April. Its leaders will have not only political power, but also control of the region\u2019s finances, which many here believe to be the main motivation for the postelection infighting.\n\u201cWe have been able to rein in people so far, but anything could happen,\u201d said Saleh al-Mutlaq, a member of the national Parliament, whose alliance won the highest percentage of votes in Anbar, 17.6 percent. The alliance, which includes tribal leaders and secular leaders known for sympathies for the former ruling Baath Party, is now positioned to play a major role in brokering a deal to lead the Provincial Council and elect a new governor.\nMr. Taha, the winning candidate from Anbar, who was one of the front-runners on Mr. Mutlaq\u2019s slate there, has served as a sports and youth adviser for the region\u2019s governor and was, he claimed, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Saddam Hussein\u2019s son Uday during the 1990s. (That the governor is affiliated to the Iraqi Islamic Party shows how convoluted politics have become in Anbar and elsewhere.)\nHe said his supporters had been threatened and beaten by police officers loyal to the Islamic Party \u2014 before the election and after. \u201cPeople will be eliminated,\u201d Mr. Taha, 37, warned.\nKhalid al-Alwani, a senior official of the Iraqi Islamic Party in Anbar, called the accusations a smear campaign. He insisted that the party\u2019s slate in Anbar won nearly 40 percent of the votes, not the 15.9 percent that was announced. The party issued a statement on Sunday accusing Sheik Ahmed and Mr. Mutlaq of practicing \u201cintimidation and extortion\u201d in order have the results declared in their favor. It vowed to \u201creclaim what is rightfully theirs.\u201d\nAnother of the party\u2019s backers called for more drastic action. Sheik Hakem al-Saad, a leader of one of the largest tribes in Anbar, called for the firing of the police chief and army commander and the declaration of a state of emergency. He accused the Awakening leader of sowing discord and inciting violence.\n\u201cAhmed Abu Risha is a bandit and thief,\u201d he said.\nThe postelection jockeying has done little for Anbar\u2019s residents, nurturing dismay and apathy instead.\nAhmed Awad, who owns a grocery store in Falluja, spoiled his ballot on election day rather than choose among the quarreling parties. \u201cWe have become demoralized,\u201d he said.\nAnbar\u2019s police chief, Maj. Gen. Tariq al-Youssef, openly disparaged the governing Islamic Party for its rule, signaling the politicization of the security forces.\nWalking through one of the city\u2019s narrow shopping streets, strewn with litter and wet with wastewater, he spoke of the lack of jobs, the dearth of rebuilding, the collapse of city services \u2014 the failure to turn the defeat of the insurgency into a better life in Anbar.\nEven so, wielding a silver-tipped black baton, or swagger stick, General Youssef said he would not allow any violence to settle what should remain political disputes.\n\u201cThe time of coups,\u201d he said, \u201cis over.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/world/middleeast/10anbar.html", "title": "After Iraqi Elections, Next Big Test Is Acceptance", "author": "STEVEN LEE MYERS and SAM DAGHER"}
{"date": "Tue, 13 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A few hours after getting off a plane from America\u2019s war zones, Joseph R. Biden Jr. slipped into a chair, shook off his jet lag and reflected on what he had seen. The situation in Iraq, he said, was much improved. In Pakistan, he said he saw encouraging signs.\nThen he came to Afghanistan and shook his head.\n\u201cIt has deteriorated significantly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very heavy lift.\u201d\nThat was six days before Mr. Biden was sworn in as vice president in January, and just after he had met with President-elect Barack Obama, who had sent him on the fact-finding mission to figure out just what the new administration was inheriting. Mr. Biden\u2019s assessment was even grimmer during his private meeting with Mr. Obama, according to officials.\nFrom the moment they took office, Mr. Biden has been Mr. Obama\u2019s in-house pessimist on Afghanistan, the strongest voice against further escalation of American forces there and the leading doubter of the president\u2019s strategy. It was a role that may have been lonely at first, but has attracted more company inside the White House as Mr. Obama rethinks the strategy he unveiled just seven months ago.\nFor Mr. Biden, a longtime senator who prided himself on his experience in foreign relations, the role represents an evolution in his own thinking, a shift from his days as a liberal hawk advocating for American involvement in Afghanistan. Month by month, year by year, the story of Mr. Biden\u2019s disenchantment with the Afghan government, and by extension with the engagement there, mirrors America\u2019s slow but steady turn against the war, with just 37 percent supporting more troops in last week\u2019s CBS News poll.\n\u201cHe came to question some of the assumptions and began asking questions about whether there might be other approaches that might get you as good or better results at lower cost,\u201d said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who has been consulted by Mr. Biden on the matter.\nMr. Biden does not favor abandoning Afghanistan, but his approach would reject the additional troops sought by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and leave the American force in Afghanistan roughly the same, 68,000 troops. Rather than emphasize protecting the Afghan population, he would accelerate training of Afghans to take over the fight while hunting Al Qaeda in Pakistan using drones and special forces. His view has caught on with many liberals in his party.\n\u201cThe vice president is asking great questions and he understands this issue very, very deeply,\u201d said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, Mr. Biden\u2019s successor as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cHe\u2019s been there many times. He knows the issues and the personalities very well. He\u2019s set out a good analysis.\u201d\nBeyond Mr. Biden\u2019s strategic concerns, some who participated in administration deliberations earlier this year said he was keenly aware that the country, and particularly his party\u2019s liberal base, was growing tired of the war and might not accept many more years of extensive American commitment.\n\u201cI think a big part of it is, the vice president\u2019s reading of the Democratic Party is this is not sustainable,\u201d said Bruce O. Riedel, who led the administration\u2019s review this year. \u201cThat\u2019s a part of the process that\u2019s a legitimate question for a president \u2014 if I do this, can I sustain it with political support at home? That was the argument the vice president was making back in the winter.\u201d\nBut Mr. Riedel said the public could be persuaded to stick by the war with a well-articulated argument by the president. And others, more harshly, argue that Mr. Biden\u2019s judgment on foreign policy has often been off base.\nThey point out that he voted against the successful Persian Gulf war of 1991, voted for the Iraq invasion of 2003, proposed dividing Iraq into three sections in 2006 and opposed the additional troops credited by many with turning Iraq around in 2007.\n\u201cWhen was the last time Biden was right about anything?\u201d Thomas E. Ricks, a military writer, wrote in a blog on Sept. 24. Mr. Ricks is affiliated with the Center for a New American Security, a research organization founded by Democrats.\nMr. Biden's office rejects that criticism.\n\"From nuclear arms control to ending ethnic cleaning in the Balkans to confronting the threat of terrorism, the vice president has not only been right on many of the toughest questions of U.S. foreign policy over the past 30 years, he has been consistently ahead of the curve,\" said Jay Carney, his communications director.\nMr. Biden\u2019s journey on the American war in Afghanistan began where it did for many political leaders. He strongly supported President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to topple the Taliban after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and after traveling there in January 2002 was convinced that half-measures were not enough.\nWhen the United States invaded Iraq, Mr. Biden\u2019s attention shifted, but he eventually expressed concern that attention was being diverted from Afghanistan and refocused on what Democrats were calling \u201cthe good war\u201d as he opened his campaign for president.\nIn January 2007, he opposed Mr. Bush\u2019s troop buildup in Iraq by arguing that \u201cif we\u2019re going to surge anywhere,\u201d then it \u201cshould be Afghanistan.\u201d In August of that year, when Mr. Obama, too, proposed more troops for Afghanistan, Mr. Biden\u2019s camp responded with a statement calling him a \u201cJohnny-come-lately\u201d and suggesting that it was \u201ca little disingenuous\u201d of Mr. Obama.\nBut by the time Mr. Biden traveled to Afghanistan again in February 2008, he was rethinking his views, according to people close to him. He had grown sour on President Hamid Karzai and the Kabul government\u2019s pervasive corruption. During a now-famous dinner, Mr. Biden became exasperated by Mr. Karzai\u2019s denials about corruption, threw down his napkin and declared, \u201cThis dinner is over.\u201d\nMr. Biden also engaged in a tough talk with Gen. Dan K. McNeill, the NATO commander in Afghanistan at the time.\n\u201cHis concept was to keep a small footprint, have an offshore strategy as the sole approach to seeking better security and stability in Afghanistan and focus on counterterrorism and the hard-core ideologues who won\u2019t change,\u201d General McNeill said. But the general disagreed: \u201cIt could lead to greater insecurity and instability in that region.\u201d\nMr. Biden had also been influenced by the difficult years in Iraq. \u201cThe Iraq experience has been an important, formative one in the sense that Biden has been much more aware that fighting insurgents is not entirely a military process,\u201d said Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser who has talked with Mr. Biden about it.\nWhen Mr. Biden visited Afghanistan in January for a third time, he returned increasingly convinced that America\u2019s national interest lay in Pakistan. With fewer than 100 Qaeda fighters left in Afghanistan, he reasoned, the nation was investing disproportionate resources in the wrong country.\nIn an interview hours after he returned, Mr. Biden sounded deeply pessimistic. \u201cThere\u2019s very little governance, there\u2019s significant corruption and the drug trade is humongous,\u201d he said. While some allies had been helpful, he said, \u201cothers have dropped the ball considerably.\u201d So Mr. Obama needed \u201cfresh assessment of and assertion of what the goal\u201d should be.\nNine months later, Mr. Obama is reassessing his goal. While officials anticipate that he will fall between the suggestions from Mr. Biden and his commanding general in Afghanistan, they agree that Mr. Biden has shaped the choices \u2014 not entirely unlike his predecessor, Dick Cheney.\n\u201cThere are some ironic similarities to Cheney\u2019s definition of the job and Biden\u2019s in one sense,\u201d Mr. Haass said. \u201cThey\u2019re both people who are not hobbled by their own ambitions, they\u2019re both experienced national security hands, and it freed up Cheney and it frees up Biden to give an honest take.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/world/14biden.html", "title": "Biden No Longer a Lone Voice on Afghanistan", "author": "PETER BAKER"}

His legs were ripped off, and after a brief struggle for air, he died in the dirt.\nAround a mostly peaceful Iraq, Americans are withdrawing from the cities, doing less soldiering and more social welfare, like establishing factories and engaging in civics lessons.\nBut this corner of Diyala Province, north of Baghdad and near the Iranian border, is one of those pockets across northern and eastern Iraq where the war is still being fought much as it was two years ago, when the \u201csurge\u201d of American troops began.\nHere violence remains high, the Sunni insurgency never defeated. As American troops withdraw, such strongholds could threaten the fragile gains in Iraq. And so the American military has mounted one of its few current combat missions to try to finally eradicate what it describes as toughened insurgents.\n\u201cThis is one of the few burning embers of Al Qaeda in Diyala,\u201d said Lt. Col. Lou Rago, who commands Task Force 3-66 Armor, which he said was the only full battalion in Iraq still tasked solely with classic counterinsurgency combat. \u201cAnd if it is not snuffed out it could reignite.\u201d\nAmerican and Iraqi soldiers are still sweeping villages, raiding homes, countering mortar attacks and struggling to dismantle a network of explosives laid by insurgents to protect their sanctuary.\n\u201cThis is the retro war in Iraq,\u201d Colonel Rago said. \u201cOther commanders are doing what they should be doing in Iraq in 2009. I am not.\u201d\nIn most of the cities, the small combat outposts created as part of the surge are being handed over to Iraq as Americans withdraw to large bases in advance of large-scale troop reductions.\nBut in South Balad Ruz, American soldiers are constructing a new combat outpost, sleeping on cots in makeshift tents in the desert.\nSince the latest operation to clear out the insurgents began here eight weeks ago, Iraqi and American vehicles have been struck by roadside bombs more than 30 times. A dozen Iraqi soldiers have been killed and three American soldiers have been seriously wounded.\nAnd for every bomb that exploded, the soldiers have found and defused two more.\nIn the largely rural area overseen by Colonel Rago, only about 1,000 residents remain in dozens of villages after Shiites fled and insurgents kidnapped and killed dozens of Sunnis. Americans have occasionally started missions in the area over the past six years, but there was never a sustained presence.\nAfter each operation, insurgents returned.\n\u201cThe enemy essentially had free rein in here,\u201d Colonel Rago said. \u201cThis is their bedroom.\u201d\nThe combat outpost in the area \u2014 named Diamond, after Staff Sgt. Sean D. Diamond, who was killed in February \u2014 marked the end of that era, Colonel Rago said.\nHe estimated that only a few hundred fighters were left. \u201cBut what they lack in numbers, they make up for in talent,\u201d he said.\nIn addition to the 800 American combat troops in the operation, there are 120 engineers and members of logistical teams in the area, as well as some 3,800 Iraqi troops.\nThe Americans are taking the lead in clearing the roads.\nCapt. Daniel Godbey, 37, said that on one of his first missions, the vehicle in front of his was struck by a roadside bomb.\n\u201cI saw the truck lift right off the ground and land again and I thought, \u2018Oh no,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut everyone walked out, their ears ringing but O.K.\u201d\nCaptain Godbey was in Iraq before, in 2004, and did tours in Afghanistan before returning, but it was his first mission in the armored vehicle known as an MRAP, which stands for for mine-resistant, ambush-protected.\nColonel Rago said that without the trucks, used here since 2007, he would have lost as many as 20 men already.\nBut what matters most, he said, is simply a persistent presence. And he said he believed that the insurgents also understood the importance of that.\n\u201cThese guys are going to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are going to die.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/world/middleeast/01diyala.html", "title": "In a Desolate Iraqi Village, War Is Far From Over", "author": "MARC SANTORA"}

After the building was cleared of civilians, she said, an American Apache helicopter fired on the clinic, ending the battle.\n\u201cOnce the troops were fired on from the clinic, it loses its protected status\u201d as a civilian location where international forces may not fire, she said. \u201cIn addition, we made sure the building was cleared of civilians, and there were no civilian deaths.\u201d\nAfghan officials said that one civilian, the watchman for the building, was wounded. It was impossible to immediately confirm the Afghan and American reports.\nOne American soldier was killed in the operation, NATO said.\nAnother American soldier was killed in an attack in southern Afghanistan on Thursday, bringing the total number of Americans killed in Afghanistan in August to 45, according to icasualties.org, an independent Web site that tracks casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. The toll is as high as the figure reported in July, which had been the deadliest month for American troops in Afghanistan.\nIn addition to the Taliban commander, identified as Mullah Muslim, 5 other insurgents were captured and 12 were killed, the office of the governor of Paktika said in a statement.\nNATO did not confirm the reports of insurgent deaths and said that seven people suspected of being militants had been detained.\nLast week\u2019s election was marred by rocket attacks, firefights and other violence, along with reports of fraud.\nWith votes from 17 percent of polling stations counted, President Hamid Karzai leads with 42 percent of the vote, and the top challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, a former foreign minister, has 33 percent.

{"date": "Sat, 15 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration is establishing a new unit within the State Department for countering militant propaganda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, engaging more fully than ever in a war of words and ideas that it acknowledges the United States has been losing.\nProposals are being considered to give the team up to $150 million a year to spend on local FM radio stations, to counter illegal militant broadcasting, and on expanded cellphone service across Afghanistan and Pakistan. The project would step up the training of local journalists and help produce audio and video programming, as well as pamphlets, posters and CDs denigrating militants and their messages.\nSenior officials say they consider the counterpropaganda mission to be vital to the war.\n\u201cConcurrent with the insurgency is an information war,\u201d said Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, who will direct the effort. \u201cWe are losing that war.\n\u201cThe Taliban have unrestricted, unchallenged access to the radio, which is the main means of communication,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can\u2019t succeed, however you define success, if we cede the airways to people who present themselves as false messengers of a prophet, which is what they do. And we need to combat it.\u201d\nThe team he is putting together is the latest entry into the government\u2019s effort to direct the flow of information in support of American policy. The campaign is scattered throughout the bureaucracy and the military, variously named public affairs, public diplomacy, strategic communications and information operations.\nOfficials acknowledge that the government routinely fails when trying to speak to the Muslim world and battle the propaganda of extremism \u2014 most often because the efforts to describe American policy and showcase American values are themselves viewed as propaganda.\nThe new campaign is especially focused on providing cellphone service, and thus some independent communications for people in remote areas where the Taliban thrive. It is a booming industry now: Afghanistan had no cellular coverage in 2001 but today has about 9.5 million subscribers.\nThat work is closely coordinated with American and allied forces in Afghanistan, where Rear Adm. Gregory J. Smith, NATO\u2019s director of communication in Kabul, said the challenge was in protecting the population and the official communications network from insurgents \u2014 a new strategic priority.\n\u201cIf we can insulate the people, separate the population from insurgents, they become less vulnerable and less susceptible to the coercion and intimidation designed to steer them away from the government of Afghanistan,\u201d Admiral Smith said.\n\u201cThe ability to communicate empowers a population,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a very important principle of counterinsurgency and counterpropaganda.\u201d\nIn southern Afghanistan, now the center of American military offensives under the troop increase ordered by President Obama, insurgents threaten commercial cellphone providers with attack if they do not switch off service early each night.\nThat prevents villagers from calling security forces if they see militants on the move or planting roadside bombs; the lack of cellphone service at night also hobbles the police and nongovernmental development agencies.\nProposals to counter insurgent threats include establishing security for cellphone towers by offering local communities money, electricity or free service to guard the towers \u2014 or even erecting cellphone towers, which cost about $200,000 each, on allied military bases.\nExpanding and securing cellphone service has the additional benefit of assisting economic development, officials said, as it could provide wireless access to banking systems for those who now must travel long distances for financial services.\nOfficials involved in the new unit say they are seeking to amplify the voices of Afghans speaking to Afghans, and Pakistanis speaking to Pakistanis, rather than have \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d stamped on the programming.\nAnd officials said the counterpropaganda unit would seek ways to \u201cdenigrate the enemy,\u201d portraying militant attacks on markets, schools and public buildings as a religious violation.\n\u201cGiven the archaic values of Al Qaeda and the Taliban, we must devise policies that expose the true nature of the militants,\u201d said Ashley Bommer, an adviser to Mr. Holbrooke. \u201cAnd we must shift the paradigm so that the debate is not between the United States and the militants, but between the people and the militants.\u201d\nOfficials said the unit would work to counter the primary routes of extremist communications, in particular low-power radio stations and the distribution of videos, CDs and \u201cnight letters\u201d \u2014 chilling militant notes that threaten violence if local residents cooperate with the government, America or its allies.\nVikram Singh, on loan from the Pentagon as Mr. Holbrooke\u2019s senior defense adviser for the project, said the United States would begin by \u201cbuilding the capabilities of the private sectors and the governments in both of these countries to effectively communicate and engage with their own populations.\u201d\nThis is particularly important, he said, in the border areas of Pakistan and across large parts of Afghanistan that for decades had only primitive communications.\nIn the tribal areas of Pakistan, for example, there are only four legal FM radio stations, compared with more than 150 illegal low-watt stations run by militants, according to officials involved in the counterpropaganda effort. Some of the insurgent radio stations are mobile, broadcasting from vehicles or even donkey carts to avoid detection and extend their reach.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/world/asia/16policy.html", "title": "U.S. Plans a Mission Against Taliban\u2019s Propaganda", "author": "THOM SHANKER"}

{"date": "Mon, 09 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Scores of Palestinian patients being treated in Israeli hospitals, a rare bright spot of coexistence here, are being sent home because the Palestinian Authority has stopped paying for their treatment, partly in anger over the war in Gaza.\nHadassah Hospital in Jerusalem says that for the past week, no payments have come in and Palestinians whose children it is treating have been instructed by Palestinian health officials to place them in facilities in the West Bank, Jordan or Egypt.\n\u201cSuddenly we have had 57 patients dropped from our rolls,\u201d said Dr. Michael Weintraub, director of pediatric hematology, oncology and bone marrow transplantation at Hadassah. \u201cWe have been bombarded by frantic parents. This is a political decision taken on the backs of patients.\u201d\nThe Palestinian health minister, Fathi Abu Moghli, said he was examining the entire referral procedure because he was tired of adding to what he called Israel\u2019s \u201coil well,\u201d meaning the payments for Palestinian patient care. In particular, he said, he had no desire to see the wounded from the Gaza war receive Israeli care.\n\u201cWe already pay $7 million a month to Israeli hospitals,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cSince the first day of the Gaza aggression, I said that I will not send to my occupier my injured people in order for him to make propaganda at my expense, and then pay him for it.\u201d\nAn Israeli clinic set up with great fanfare on the Israeli-Gaza border the day the war ended, Jan. 18, has already closed, since both Hamas, which governs Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority essentially boycotted it. The Palestinian Authority pays for much of its citizens\u2019 care in Israel from its budget.\nIsrael has long pointed to its medical care of Palestinians as an example of its advanced skills and humanitarianism. Palestinians generally are eager to gain the benefit, but are also resentful. As relations have chilled, each side has accused the other of political manipulation.\nDr. Abu Moghli said that with 24 hospitals in Gaza and the West Bank, there was no reason for so many Palestinian patients to go automatically to Israeli facilities, which he said were much more expensive and contributed to a culture of dependency.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pay our government salaries this month, but at the same time I have to pay Israeli hospitals so much,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Israelis have refused to reduce their costs.\u201d\nIsraeli doctors and nonprofit groups support having the Palestinians provide more care for their own people, but say that the gap with Israel in quality remains huge, and that the Palestinian Authority is making a mistake that could cost lives.\n\u201cCutting it in one day makes no sense,\u201d said Ron Pundak, director general of the Peres Center for Peace, which sponsors care for 1,000 Palestinian children a year in Israeli hospitals and training for 40 Palestinian doctors. \u201cSuch a move needs to be coordinated, but dialogue with the Palestinian Authority has been much harder since the war.\u201d\nAnan Dahmi, a salesman from the West Bank city of Tulkarm, said he had been told by the Palestinian Health Ministry last week that his 4-year-old son, Aous, had to stop going to Hadassah Hospital for follow-up treatments after a bone marrow transplant there a year ago, and should be taken instead to a Palestinian or Jordanian hospital.\nMr. Dahmi said that his 6-year-old daughter had died from the same disorder because he had not gotten her to Hadassah quickly enough, and that now he was deeply worried about his son.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I am going to manage,\u201d he said by telephone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my son the way I lost my daughter.\u201d\nHadassah officials say that removing Aous from their care could endanger his life, because his medical requirements are strict and specific and there is not yet a pediatric oncology facility in the Palestinian areas (one in East Jerusalem is due to start functioning, with Israeli help, in the coming year).\nThey add that while the cost of care is much higher in Israel than in the West Bank, Palestinians are not charged the higher rates for foreigners but those for Israelis \u2014 which are much lower than rates in the United States or Western Europe. In addition, they say, there are subsidies from foreign governments, charities and the hospital itself.\n\u201cThe cure rate for childhood cancer is about 80 percent, but only in the first world,\u201d Dr. Weintraub, of Hadassah, said. \u201cIt costs between $50,000 and $100,000 here. It costs four times that in the U.S.\u201d\nHe added that the relationship between an Israeli hospital in Jerusalem and patients in the West Bank was like that between a hospital in El Paso and patients on the Mexican side of the border.\n\u201cPeople in the third world want first-world care just like we do,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they live in Malawi, they have no hope for it. But if they live 10 minutes from Hadassah, they will do everything they can to get admitted. And we are happy to take them. There are no politics in our wards. Twenty percent of our patients are Palestinians, and we have one common enemy: cancer. The rest is immaterial. The question now is how to get those patients back into our care.\u201d\nHamas Returns Supplies to U.N.\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) \u2014 The United Nations said Monday that Hamas had returned all of the aid supplies that it seized from the agency in the Gaza Strip last week.\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency said the return of the supplies cleared the way for it to resume all of its operations in Gaza. The agency had suspended imports of goods on Friday after accusing Hamas of twice seizing aid supplies, which included food and blankets.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/world/middleeast/10patients.html", "title": "Palestinians Stop Paying Israeli Hospitals for Gaza and West Bank Patients", "author": "ETHAN BRONNER"}
{"date": "Sun, 19 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ALIABAD, Afghanistan \u2014 The two Army lieutenants crouched against boulders beside the Korangal River. Taliban gunfire poured down from villages and cliffs above, hitting tree branches and rocks and snapping as the bullets passed over the officers\u2019 helmets.\nAn American platoon was pinned in the riverbed, which had blossomed into a kill zone. One squad and the radio operator were trapped in a wheat field on the far side. An improvised bomb had just exploded in their midst. The blast wave had blown the soldiers down, and, though the platoon did not yet know it, killed a soldier on the trail.\nThe platoon leader, company executive officer and another squad crouched exposed at a stream junction, trying to arrange help as the bomb\u2019s smoke drifted through the misty rain. A third squad was on the slope behind them, returning fire.\nTwo footbridges separated the three American groups. No one could run across them during fire like this.\nAnother pitched firefight in a ravine in eastern Afghanistan had begun, shaped by factors that have made the war against the Taliban seem unending: grueling terrain that favors ambushes and prevents American soldiers from massing; villages in thorough collaboration with insurgents; and experienced adversaries each fighting in concert with its abilities and advantages.\nThe Taliban fighters had struck with surprise, stealth and familiarity with the ground, executing the sort of ambush that Afghan guerrillas have mastered for generations.\nThe Americans, seasoned by years of war here and in Iraq, would seek to create an intricately violent response, designed to undo the odds, save the pinned soldiers and kill the insurgents who, for a moment, had shown themselves.\nSecond Lt. Justin R. Smith, the platoon leader, called for help from an artillery battery, then radioed Sgt. Craig W. Tanner, the squad leader on the opposite side. Each man had found what cover he could. The platoon would fight where it was.\n\u201cLead element: stand by where you\u2019re at,\u201d the lieutenant said. \u201cIf you come back across the river you\u2019re going to expose yourself.\u201d He glanced across the water at his radio operator, Specialist Robert Soto. \u201cSoto!\u201d he shouted. \u201cStay there! Stay! There!\u201d\nThere are moments in many firefights that verge on chaos. This was one of them. Specialist Soto\u2019s ears were ringing. He could not hear. \u201cWe gotta move!\u201d he shouted.\n\u2022\nThe American patrol had left Korangal Outpost, the base for Company B of the First Battalion, 26th Infantry, on Wednesday, roughly an hour before the ambush. Its mission had been to enter the village of Laneyal and meet with local elders.\nPreparing for the mission, the company\u2019s Second Platoon had predicted a fight. The platoon had ambushed a Taliban unit a few days before, killing at least 13 insurgents. The Taliban would want revenge, said Sgt. First Class Thomas Wright, the platoon sergeant, and a patrol to Laneyal meant a walk into a bad village.\nAfghanistan is myriad wars within a war, with varying terrain, climates, economies and insurgent groups creating a puzzle of shifting contests for influence. The Korangal Valley is the center of one of the most vicious contests of all.\nRelatively few Arabs or foreigners come here, the company\u2019s officers say. But the Korangalis, a hardened and isolated people with their own language, have managed to lock the American Army into a bloody standoff for a small space for more than three years.\nThe Korangalis have fought, the officers say, in part because they support the Taliban and in part because they are loggers and the Afghan government banned almost all timber cutting, putting local men out of work.\nKorangal Outpost itself symbolizes the dispute. It occupies a former sawmill, and the mill\u2019s displaced owner is a main organizer of the insurgency. The Taliban pay the best wages in the valley now, the officers said.\nCompany B\u2019s relations with local villagers are cordial but ultimately unhelpful, undermined by deception. After the platoon ambushed the Taliban patrol several days earlier, for instance, elders arrived at the outpost to say that the Americans had shot up a search party of local men who were looking for a lost girl. The company commander, Capt. James C. Howell, told the elders it was one of the most ridiculous lies he had ever heard.\n\u2022\nThe platoon reached Aliabad, the village on the slope opposite Laneyal, and began the descent down a stone staircase to the river. On the way down they met Zarin, an elder from Laneyal, who was heading up.\nZarin exchanged pleasantries and shook hands with Company B\u2019s executive officer, First Lt. John P. Rodriguez, and bounded quickly away.\nThe platoon continued on. With several soldiers remaining in Aliabad with guns aimed at the opposite side, two squads and the officers crossed a narrow footbridge and reached a point where two branches of the river converge.\nThen the lead squad crossed the second bridge, entering a terraced wheat field. The Taliban let the first five men cross, then detonated the bomb under Pfc. Richard A. Dewater, 21, as he walked up the trail. It was a huge explosion, heaving dirt and rock high in the air.\nThe Taliban opened fire. The ambush was on.\nLieutenant Smith asked Sergeant Tanner for a report. The blast had blown the sergeant off his feet, spinning him around and throwing him down. He was disoriented. He said he thought he had all of his men.\nAs the firing neared its peak, Lieutenant Smith ordered the men around him to disperse so they could not all be struck by a single burst of fire. Then he provided covering fire so the artillery observer and a machine gun team could run back across the first bridge, gain elevation in Aliabad and cover the squad in the field.\nA soldier caught in an ambush \u2014 looking for safety while returning fire, with ears ringing and skin pouring sweat \u2014 can feel utterly alone, trapped in a box of crisscrossing lead and terrifying sound, with death an instant away.\nHe is actually part of something more complicated. Bullets flew down into the riverbed from three sides. But as the lieutenants worked their radios, soldiers outside the kill zone were trying to erode the Taliban\u2019s opening advantage.\nWithin the platoon, the squad in the rear of the column set up its machine guns and was firing on several of the Taliban shooting positions. A group of Afghan National Army soldiers, directed by a Marine corporal, was also firing.\nIn American firebases on ridges along the valley, soldiers with heavier machine guns and automatic grenade launchers focused on Afghan buildings in three villages \u2014 Donga, Laneyal and Darbart \u2014 from where the trapped platoon was taking fire.\nFarther back, at Company B\u2019s outpost, a pair of Air Force noncommissioned officers was directing aircraft into position, while two 120-millimeter mortars were firing high-explosive and white phosphorus rounds at targets the platoon had identified.\nAlternately crouched and standing on the open rock spur, the lieutenants rushed to influence the fight and plan an escape from the trap. Once the American response began to build and the Taliban firing subsided, Lieutenant Rodriguez told Lieutenant Smith, they would throw smoke grenades along the river bank and pull back.\nSpecialist Soto could not wait. After mortar rounds began landing, he and a photographer for The New York Times dashed down the bank, splashed into the chest-deep brown river, lunged across the current and crawled out on the opposite side.\nThey staggered up the Aliabad slope and slipped behind a building as the platoon\u2019s guns fired, covering their dash. They had made it out of the worst of the kill zone.\nThe Taliban kept firing. The American squad in the wheat field, perhaps 50 yards away, radioed that insurgents were getting closer and that the soldiers risked being overrun. At almost the same time, Air Force Staff Sgt. Kenneth Walker radioed Lieutenant Rodriguez with news that the first 500-pound aircraft bomb was about to strike.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to do the drop in, like, 30 seconds!\u201d Lieutenant Rodriguez shouted to Lieutenant Smith. \u201cLet your boys know!\u201d\nThe aircraft had arrived just in time. A Taliban fighter appeared behind a stone fence. He was almost atop the soldiers in the field.\n\u201cWe got muzzle flashes,\u201d Lieutenant Smith said, and now the Americans had clear targets. The stones beside where the Taliban fighter had stood began to splinter as the platoon\u2019s bullets struck it. Then the satellite-guided bomb whooshed in and exploded.\nTwo stray rocket-propelled grenades landed to the lieutenants\u2019 left side. But the Taliban\u2019s firing decreased, as if the insurgents, experienced with American tactics, had sensed the battle shifting and were being ordered back.\nThe platoon threw smoke grenades, obscuring visibility in the riverbed. Five soldiers appeared at the edge of the green stand of wheat, running toward the officers.\nThey leapt into the water. The two lieutenants had spent the fight exposed; now they ran back across the first footbridge. The platoon climbed the steep staircase into Aliabad and took cover.\nAs the soldiers panted for air, they cursed Zarin, the elder who had walked through the kill zone just before the ambush; he had set them up, they said.\nTwo more airstrikes blew apart two buildings on the opposite side from where the Taliban had been firing. The battle quieted.\nPfc. Rogger J. Webb looked at Specialist Soto, the last man to cross the bridge before the bomb had exploded on the trail. \u201cMan, I thought \u2014\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou thought I was gone?\u201d Specialist Soto said.\nPrivate Webb nodded. The platoon did a head count and came to an awful realization: Private Dewater was missing. He had walked into the wheat field with the squad. He had not run out.\nPrivate Webb swore. Had the Taliban captured him? Had he been struck during the fight? The soldiers did not know. The platoon retraced its steps toward Laneyal as the sun set.\n\u2022\nBack at the outpost, American and Afghan soldiers flowed out into the darkness. The Afghans would scour the riverbed in case the missing soldier had ended up in the water. The captain told the platoons to be prepared to search every house in the villages, in case the Taliban had dragged him off.\nWearing night-vision equipment, the platoon combed the ambush site in the rain. The company waited for news. At 8:10 p.m., Specialist Soto\u2019s strained voice came over the radio.\n\u201cBreak, break, break,\u201d he said, using the convention for stopping all conversations.\nEveryone knew what it meant. Lieutenant Smith\u2019s voice replaced Specialist Soto\u2019s. \u201cWe found him,\u201d he said. The first explosion had killed Private Dewater and lifted his body into a tree.\n\u201cRoger,\u201d the captain answered. \u201cUnderstand all.\u201d\nSgt. Matthew R. Kuhn climbed the branches to free the missing man. In an instant, Second Platoon\u2019s mission had changed. It would carry Private Dewater on the first steps of his journey home.\nThe soldiers gently rested their friend onto a stretcher, organized into teams of litter bearers and began the long walk back, over the two footbridges, up the Aliabad staircase and past the other soldiers and Marines, who provided security and stood quietly in respect.\nHe was the fourth member of Second Platoon killed during nine months in the valley.\nWhen the platoon reached its outpost at midnight, the company\u2019s commander, Captain Howell, was waiting. The soldiers gathered in the darkness. The captain spoke of his pride in the platoon and offered the first of many words of condolence.\n\u201cThere is nothing I can say or anybody else can say that will bring Dewater back,\u201d he said, and reminded the platoon of its own ambush of the Taliban the week before. \u201cBut the best thing we can do for him is to continue to do the type of stuff that you guys did the other day.\u201d\nThe soldiers headed for the plywood shacks where they live, for the remainder of a night in which almost no one would sleep.\nIn the morning they disassembled and cleaned their weapons and recalled their friend as they played his favorite song: \u201cNothing Else Matters,\u201d by Metallica. A heap of their bloody clothes burned in a small fire.\nPrivate Dewater had been a combat replacement in the platoon: \u201cA real humble dude, and totally positive about everything we did,\u201d Specialist Soto said.\nHis body had already been flown off the outpost by helicopter in the night, the next step of the trip back to the United States.\nA few hours later, the soldiers slipped into their body armor and helmets, hoisted their weapons and walked back out for an overnight patrol.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/asia/20ambush.html", "title": "Pinned Down, a Sprint to Escape Taliban Zone", "author": "C.

{"date": "Fri, 26 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JERUSALEM\nAFTER 60 roller-coaster years in Israeli politics, including two stints as prime minister, Shimon Peres probably did not expect his career to take any more surprising turns. When he became president of the nation two years ago, a job usually described here as ceremonial, many Israelis assumed the man long known as a perennial plotter and dreamer would gracefully semi-retire.\nInstead, Mr. Peres, 85, the last of Israel\u2019s founding fathers in office, seems to have been reborn. Though he was often mocked here in the past as a serial election loser and has commanded less respect for his dovish political views at home than abroad, Mr. Peres is basking in more power and public acceptance than ever before.\nYouthful looking and elegantly attired, he says he now enjoys \u201cunprecedented popularity, which is almost embarrassing for me \u2014 I\u2019m not used to it.\u201d He adds that he has discovered a new force, the \u201ctremendous good will of the people,\u201d which he says can be \u201cmore powerful than government.\u201d\nHis eminence has been bolstered by the advent of a predominantly conservative government in Israel and an innate sense among Israelis that such governments, though democratically elected, are harmful to the country\u2019s image \u2014 a feeling reinforced by the appointment of Avigdor Lieberman, a blunt and outspoken nationalist, as minister of foreign affairs.\nNow Mr. Peres, drawing on his considerable influence as an elder statesman and his seemingly boundless energy, is translating the novelty of public acceptance into practical clout. \u201cIn almost two years as president,\u201d he said in an interview at his official residence earlier this month, \u201cI did not hear the word \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d\nOne sign of his tireless efforts came this month when Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, of the conservative Likud Party, finally acquiesced, albeit with caveats, to the idea of a Palestinian state, a step that was welcomed by the White House and which helped soften Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s image of intransigence abroad.\nAt an inauguration ceremony at the presidential residence on April 1, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s first day in office, Mr. Peres urged the new prime minister to advance the peace process and pointedly reminded him that the vision of two states for two peoples was \u201cinitiated by the American government and accepted by the majority of countries in the world.\u201d\nIn the few weeks since, under intense pressure to fall into line with Washington, Mr. Netanyahu spent many hours in private discussions with Mr. Peres, who was elected by Parliament to a seven-year term as president in June 2007.\n\u201cI am not imposing anything on Mr. Netanyahu,\u201d Mr. Peres said. \u201cI think he seeks my advice willingly,\u201d he added, describing himself as a friend.\nThey make something of an odd couple. Though Mr. Peres\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes being the father of Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons program, Israelis have traditionally seen him as a pro-peace idealist, while Mr. Netanyahu is widely seen as a security hawk.\nBUT Mr. Peres, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with the late Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat for the Oslo peace accords, is considered more practiced in the ways of the world.\nIn a striking departure from diplomatic norms, Mr. Peres met with President Obama in Washington before Mr. Netanyahu did, to try to smooth the way. \u201cI was reluctant,\u201d said Mr. Peres. \u201cI did not want to steal the show.\u201d But the prime minister insisted, according to Mr. Peres. He said he told Mr. Obama that he was speaking not on the prime minister\u2019s behalf, but with his consent and his blessing.\nWhen Shakespeare was rendered into Hebrew for the first time, Mr. Peres recalled, the \u201cmodest translator\u201d introduced the oeuvre as \u201ctranslated and improved.\u201d In explaining the Israeli government\u2019s position to Mr. Obama, Mr. Peres hinted mischievously, he may have done the same thing.\nWhile the president of Israel is legally the head of state and the office has no limitations, it has often been confined in the past to formalities like assigning elected leaders to form new governments, accrediting diplomats, receiving foreign dignitaries and pardoning offenders. Mr. Peres says it is really the informal role that counts.\nOne might have expected such activism by Mr. Peres to rile the Israeli public and be seen as meddling. After all, as a Labor Party leader, he lost election after election \u2014 including a parliamentary vote for the presidency in 2000 to a far less distinguished Likud politician, Moshe Katsav. He was also once described as an \u201cindefatigable schemer\u201d by his political partner and rival, Mr. Rabin.\nYet, the only criticism of his actions has come from a few ultranationalists, and then it has been relatively low-key.\n\u201cEverybody understands that he is an asset to the country,\u201d said Clinton Bailey, an Israeli scholar and commentator, citing \u201ca certain sense of pride and gratification he gives people across the board.\u201d\nOfer Shelah, a columnist, recently wrote in the popular Maariv newspaper that Mr. Peres\u2019s actions would \u201celicit anger if done by anyone else.\u201d But given Mr. Lieberman\u2019s propensity for \u201csetting verbal fires,\u201d Mr. Shelah noted, \u201cpublic relations work and forging relations with foreign countries will be done by Peres.\u201d\nMr. Peres is also seen as restoring honor to the presidency. His predecessor, Mr. Katsav, is soon to go on trial on charges of rape, indecent acts and sexual harassment, while Mr. Katsav\u2019s predecessor, the late Ezer Weizman, stepped down early amid accusations of financial wrongdoing.\nDURING the interview, Mr. Peres kept referring to David Ben-Gurion, a founding father of the state of Israel and its first prime minister, who took the young, Polish-born Mr. Peres at 24 under his wing and later made him his deputy minister of defense.\n\u201cI admired his honesty, his depth, his vision. Personally he pampered me very much,\u201d Mr. Peres recalled, adding that Mr. Ben-Gurion gave him tremendous support for reasons that were hard for him to decode at the time, though today, he says he better understands.\nAs Mr. Ben-Gurion\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and perhaps aspiring to be remembered as his heir, Mr. Peres feels vindicated for having taken positions once considered divisive. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s acceptance of the two-state principle, he said, brings the Israeli left and the right full circle 70 years after Mr. Ben-Gurion concluded that there was no choice but to accept a Jewish nation on part of the land, sanctioning partition.\n\u201cWhat finally won was the reality,\u201d he said.\nMr. Peres combines experience with curiosity and a delight of innovation. He has championed nanotechnology and the electric car, and speaks passionately about emerging industries he believes Israel could excel in, like stem cell research to produce what he calls \u201chuman spare parts\u201d or alternative energies to counteract the power of oil. The sun, he said, is \u201cmore democratic, more permanent and not a member of the Arab League or any other league.\u201d\nHe says he sometimes longs for the \u201cfighting period\u201d when he was at the heart of the political fray.\nMostly, though, he has found a new freedom in staying away from the rancor of Israeli politics. \u201cAt my age and in my position I do not need a suntan,\u201d he said. \u201cI can stay in the shadow, quietly. I do not need to compete.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/world/middleeast/27peres.html", "title": "Israel\u2019s Elder Statesman, Now With Renewed Clout", "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER"}

Although weakened in recent years, the group continues to have a presence in the south, with ambushes of government forces and kidnappings of aid workers and journalists.\nMaj. Gen. Benjamin Dolorfino, commander of the Western Mindanao Command of the Philippine military, said Abu Sayyaf had help from members of the separatist group Moro Islamic Liberation Front, who he said had tried to collect weapons from fallen government soldiers at the site of the raid. The front, in a statement, confirmed that 10 of its members were killed but denied that they were working with the Abu Sayyaf. Eid Kabalu, a spokesman for the front, said government soldiers had attacked the guerrillas first.\nThe front has been fighting for a separate Islamic state for decades, while the Abu Sayyaf, military officials say, has increasingly degenerated into kidnapping, extortion and banditry, using ransom payments to finance its operations.\nGeneral Dolorfino said that 20 marines and three army soldiers had died in the raids. He said an initial body count of 31 dead militants was likely to rise.\nOfficials said the forces were so close to each other that \u201cit almost came to hand-to-hand combat,\u201d Rear Adm. Alexander Pama, a military commander on Basilan, told Reuters.\nGeneral Dolorfino called it a \u201cslugfest\u201d and said that \u201cit was really close-quarter fighting, so we couldn\u2019t use our artillery,\u201d The Associated Press reported.\nTwo senior Abu Sayyaf leaders, Khair Mundus and Furuji Indama, had been the principal targets of the raids, said Lt. Steffani Cacho, an army spokeswoman, but she said it was not immediately clear whether they were among the dead.\nThe raids in Basilan began at 3 a.m. Wednesday and lasted until evening, General Dolorfino said. The camps were being used for explosives training, according to an army spokesman, Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr., who added that bomb-making materials and devices had been seized.\nThe fighting Wednesday was the latest in a series of clashes between government forces and insurgents in recent months. In February, several Abu Sayyaf members were killed as soldiers sought to rescue Eugenio Vagni, an Italian Red Cross worker who was abducted with two colleagues in January.\nAfter Mr. Vagni was released by his Abu Sayyaf kidnappers last month, the Philippine Defense Department announced new offensives against the group and sent a surge of fresh troops into Basilan.\n\u201cThe message of the government is clear: We will not make compromises with terrorists,\u201d Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro said at the time. \u201cLet\u2019s not stop. Let\u2019s intensify our counterterror efforts in Basilan so we can conquer the Abu Sayyaf once and for all.\u201d\nUnited States troops were initially sent to Basilan in 2002 to help train the Philippine military to counter Abu Sayyaf. Those efforts have substantially weakened the group, but Abu Sayyaf has begun to build alliances with Jemaah Islamiyah, the Southeast Asian terrorist network, to develop its bomb-making expertise, officials here in Manila say.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/world/asia/14phils.html", "title": "23 Filipino Soldiers Killed in Clashes", "author": "CARLOS H.

Multiple partners are required to rule India today.\nThe vote tally will be announced Saturday. But it could take several days of bartering and deal-making for a final government to be formed.\nIf the gap between the number of seats won by the two largest national parties, the ruling Indian National Congress and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, is large enough, the leading party could stitch up a coalition relatively quickly. If the gap is small, the haggling could be protracted and messy, and small regional party bosses could bargain harder to either weaken their local rivals or grab lucrative, powerful ministries.\n\u201cIf you want to govern India, you will have to deal with them,\u201d said Kapil Sibal, a Congress leader in the capital, referring to the regional bosses. \u201cLet us see what the arithmetic is on the 16th.\u201d\nWith an eye on the arithmetic, the small party bosses are likely to bargain hard. J. Jayalalithaa, a politician from the large swing state of Tamil Nadu in the south, told reporters on Wednesday that she had not yet accepted anyone\u2019s \u201covertures\u201d and that she would wait until after Saturday to decide whose tent she would choose. Amar Singh, a party boss from northern Uttar Pradesh state, put it more bluntly when he said his party would demand its \u201cpound of flesh\u201d in exchange for its support.\nIndia faces tough challenges both at home and abroad \u2014 with several neighboring countries, including Pakistan, in dangerous disarray \u2014 and the worst global economic crisis in decades.\nThere was virtually no discussion of the substantive issues on the campaign trail. They are likely to be hammered out only after the next administration forms. Elections today are rather an assertion of identity for India\u2019s many regions and castes, each of them scrambling for a piece of the national political pie.\n\u201cIndia\u2019s democratic competition today is fundamentally about how India\u2019s power structure will accommodate its many regional and, especially, caste diversities,\u201d said Ashutosh Varshney, a professor of politics at Brown University. \u201cA lot of time is spent on bargaining, representing and accommodating.\u201d\nState by state, district by district, the elections were fought over local concerns. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, the ethnic civil war in Sri Lanka, a few hours\u2019 boat ride from the southern tip of the state, emerged as a delicate poll issue. In West Bengal, land acquisition for industrial projects divided the electorate. In Bihar, it was flood relief.\nTurnout hovered close to 60 percent of India\u2019s 714 million eligible voters, according to the election commission, higher than in the last two parliamentary polls. Still, despite an unprecedented voter education drive, turnout in Mumbai was far lower than many had anticipated in the aftermath of the November terrorist attacks.\nElection-related violence was concentrated in remote, rural pockets in the Indian interior, where Maoist insurgents had called for a poll boycott; all told, 37 people died, mostly security personnel and election workers attacked by the leftist guerrillas.\nThe election offered an object lesson in the biggest paradox of the world\u2019s biggest democracy. Over the course of five weeks, voters chose a particular party, but had no way of telling which parties would be its allies.\n\u201cIt is open house,\u201d said Vinod Mehta, the editor in chief of the weekly magazine Outlook. \u201cIt has happened before, but not at this scale and not with this level of cynicism.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/world/asia/14india.html", "title": "Voting Complete, India Awaits Deal-Making", "author": "SOMINI SENGUPTA"}

{"date": "Sun, 19 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago \u2014 Leaders from the Western Hemisphere, inspired by a new American president, closed a two-day summit meeting proclaiming a new dawn for relations in the region, which had been marked by bitter disagreements in recent years with the United States.\nThe antagonism seemed to melt away, replaced by a palpable enthusiasm for a new openness from the United States and hopes of improved relations for Washington with Venezuela and Cuba, which emerged as a core issue here.\nThe newfound togetherness was a turning point for the region, leaders here said, at a time when the ability to work together could prove critical to weathering the global economic crisis, which threatens to reverse gains the region has made in alleviating poverty in the past several years.\n\u201cThere was a spirit of good will that went way beyond the wildest dreams of any one of us,\u201d Patrick Manning, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, said Sunday.\nSome of that good will went too far for President Obama\u2019s critics in Washington, where seemingly friendly images of him with President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela and Mr. Obama\u2019s overtures to Cuba drew criticism from Republican lawmakers.\nSenator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, said on CNN that it was \u201cirresponsible for the president\u201d to be seen laughing and joking with \u201cone of the most anti-American leaders in the entire world,\u201d referring to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.\nAnd Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pointed to Cuba\u2019s estimated 200 political prisoners. \u201cRelease the prisoners and we\u2019ll talk to you,\u201d he said of the Cuban government on Fox News Sunday, adding, \u201cPut up or shut up.\u201d\nMr. Obama defended his overtures at a news conference on Sunday, saying the handshakes and the polite conversation he shared with Mr. Ch\u00e1vez here were hardly \u201cendangering the strategic interests of the United States.\u201d\nWrapping up a four-day swing through Latin America, he said he believed he had paved the way for \u201cfrank dialogue\u201d with countries like Venezuela and Cuba, whose relations with the United States have been badly strained.\nBut he also sought to calibrate his message, saying Sunday that he had \u201cgreat differences\u201d with Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and insisting that freedom for the Cuban people would remain the guiding principle of his foreign policy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s our lodestone, our North Star,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nExpectations had been low for the fifth Summit of the Americas, where Mr. Obama joined 33 other leaders on his first trip to Latin America and the Caribbean since taking office. The last such summit meeting, in Argentina in 2005, was marked by violent riots and anti-American rants by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.\nLeaders left here almost shell-shocked by the lack of tension at this year\u2019s gathering, with Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s president, saying he was \u201cextremely surprised\u201d by what transpired.\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada said, \u201cThe most remarkable thing about this conference was the failure to fulfill expectations of great confrontation.\u201d\nDespite the warm feelings, some old tensions remained. President Evo Morales of Bolivia confronted Mr. Obama during a private session on Saturday with a charge that the United States had plotted to assassinate him. Mr. Obama responded on Sunday, saying, \u201cI am absolutely opposed and condemn any efforts at violent overthrows of democratically elected governments.\u201d\nAnd President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, an old Washington nemesis, sought to embarrass Mr. Obama in a nearly one-hour speech filled with anti-American vitriol in which he likened the American embargo of Cuba to the Berlin Wall.\nSummit meeting organizers on the island of Trinidad, which was transformed into a virtual police state for three days, tamped down Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s impulses to grandstand before the cameras by keeping the meetings closed-door. By the conference\u2019s end, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said he was ready to send an ambassador to the United States.\nStill, Mr. Obama said Sunday that the Venezuelan leader\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric had been \u201ca source of concern,\u201d adding that \u201cthe test for all of us is not simply words, but also deeds.\u201d\nMr. Obama said he was not worried about the political fallout, saying that he tries to figure out \u201cwhat\u2019s right in terms of America interests. And on this one, I think I\u2019m right.\u201d\nHoping to push the process forward, leaders from Latin America and the Caribbean have volunteered to aid in a reconciliation between the United States and Cuba. \u201cBrazil would be able to help,\u201d Mr. da Silva said Sunday. In an interview published Sunday in the Spanish newspaper ABC, he said the United States should not wait for Cuba to take the next step in efforts to end their half-century of feuding.\nWhile Cuba did not dominate all the deliberations, it overshadowed closed-door discussions here about regional energy needs, climate change, regional drug policy and the global economic crisis. The leaders ultimately agreed to work to strengthen the Inter-American Development Bank to assist countries struggling with a lack of access to credit.\nMr. Manning said that the final declaration from Port of Spain did not properly reflect the current global crisis because negotiations over the document began more than a year and a half ago.\nHe denied that conflicts at the 2005 meeting, or Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s history of using such events to rail against the United States and others, had anything to do with keeping the leaders\u2019 discussions private. Public scrutiny \u201cstifles a full and free expression of views,\u201d Mr. Manning said, which \u201ccould lead in some instances to posturing.\u201d\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez took the initiative Saturday, saying he was naming Roy Chaderton, Venezuela\u2019s representative to the Organization of American States, to be his new ambassador to Washington.\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez had ejected the American ambassador to Venezuela in September, saying he had discovered an American-backed plot to remove him from power. Washington responded in kind.\nThe State Department said that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez approached Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to discuss returning ambassadors to their respective posts in Caracas and Washington.

{"date": "Sat, 06 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PRAGUE \u2014 Trieu Dinh Van\u2019s long journey two years ago from the rice paddies of northern Vietnam to a truck-welding factory in the Czech Republic was supposed to open up an economic lifeline. His parents, poor farmers, bet everything on him, putting up the family farm as collateral for a loan of about $14,000 to pay an agent for his plane ticket and working visa.\nInstead, Mr. Van, 25, is jobless, homeless and heavily indebted in a faraway land, set adrift by a global economic crisis that swallowed his $11-an-hour job and those of thousands among the wave of 20,000 Vietnamese workers who came here in 2007.\nThe Vietnamese workers are part of a larger influx of poor Asian workers, including tens of thousands from China, Mongolia and elsewhere, who were recruited to come to Eastern Europe to become low-skilled foot soldiers in then booming economies. Now, they have been hit particularly hard by the sudden contraction of those economies.\nIn Romania, hundreds of desperate Chinese migrants camped out in freezing temperatures in Bucharest for several weeks in a protest against contractors who had stopped paying them.\nIn the Czech Republic, soaring unemployment, which economists think could hit 8 percent by year\u2019s end, has driven many Czechs to seek the low-wage work they once left to foreign laborers.\nThere has been a corresponding surge of resentment against minorities here, leading to fears of attacks like the one last month in which a young Roma child and her parents were severely burned when their home was firebombed in the northeastern town of Vitkov.\nVietnamese workers have been a particular point of contention, even though there is a longstanding Vietnamese community here, born amid the fraternal work programs in the 1970s.\n\u201cThe Czechs don\u2019t like us because we look different,\u201d said Mr. Van, who lamented that he had already been accosted in Chocen, the small industrial town in eastern Bohemia where he worked, by locals shouting, \u201cVietnamese, go home!\u201d Vietnamese laborers, he said, were also denied access to local discos and restaurants.\nThe government has responded by trying to find ways to ship out Asian immigrants. Under a voluntary return policy started in February, any unemployed foreign worker who wants to go home is eligible for free one-way air or rail fare and about $700 in cash.\nIn the first two months, about 2,000 Mongolians, Ukrainians and Kazakhs took up the offer.\nBut like Mr. Van, many of the Vietnamese workers here, saddled with debt, would prefer to stay and wait for better times.\n\u201cIt would not be good for me to go back to Vietnam,\u201d he said on a recent day, wondering where he would spend the night. \u201cI would return home with empty hands and couldn\u2019t marry or build a house. That would be a great shame for me.\u201d\nIvan Langer, who until recently was the interior minister and devised the return policy, said he worried that an estimated 12,000 jobless foreign workers were vulnerable to becoming involved in organized crime or being exploited as slave labor.\nJulie Lien Vrbkova, who has worked as a Vietnamese interpreter at several automobile factories in the Czech Republic, said she had been shocked by \u201cslave-like\u201d working conditions, including 12-hour days during which Vietnamese workers were beaten if they stopped working.\nAt one factory, she recalled, a Vietnamese man had worked a week with a broken rib because he was afraid to ask for time off.\nThe tensions are a troubling setback for the Vietnamese community here, long considered a regional success story. Many own thriving corner shops, speak Czech, and send their children to mainstream public schools, where they are routinely ranked at the top of their classes.\nAfter the overthrow of Communism in 1989, thousands more Vietnamese joined those who arrived in the 1970s. Today there are an estimated 70,000 Vietnamese in the Czech Republic, the second largest foreign community after Ukrainians.\nBut Vietnamese leaders here say they fear the new class of dispossessed workers threatens to disturb a coexistence they built over decades. An April poll by Stem, a Prague-based public opinion firm, found that 66 percent of Czech respondents said they would not like to have a Vietnamese person as a neighbor.\nLinh Nguyen, 22, a second-generation Vietnamese Czech who is campaigning for the government to improve its integration policies, said the hardworking Vietnamese preferred to quietly prosper while the Czechs were content to pretend they were not there.\nHe lamented that four decades after the first Asian migrants arrived in the Czech Republic, there were no Asian faces on television, in Czech popular culture or in Parliament.\nIn an effort to improve integration, the government recently introduced new rules that require immigrants who want to acquire a business license to have 120 hours of introductory Czech; but the lessons cost about $250, a price that many poor migrants cannot afford to pay.\nThe challenges of assimilation are evident at Sapa, a sprawling Vietnamese market on the outskirts of Prague, where newly arrived migrants can find Vietnamese hairdressers, Vietnamese insurance companies and a thriving business of Czech-speaking Vietnamese \u201cmiddlemen,\u201d who for fees ranging from about $25 to perhaps $7,000, can arrange for visas, take fellow Vietnamese to doctors and attend parent-teacher meetings as surrogates.\nTrang Thu Tran, 21, a Vietnamese blogger, who came to the Czech Republic when she was 13 and now calls herself Tereza, after a Czech soap opera star, said the construction of a separate and parallel world meant that many Vietnamese, including those in the country for decades, could not speak Czech and were forced to phone a middleman to interpret, even when pulled over in their cars by Czech police officers.\nTran Qang Hung, the managing director of Sapa, said many jobless migrants were coming to the market in a vain search for work.\nHe said he had proposed to the Czech government building a school for the migrants, where they could study Czech and become more employable. But he said he had been turned down.\n\u201cNow that the economy is bad, the Czechs don\u2019t want these people here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey only want them to go home.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/world/asia/07viet.html", "title": "Czechs Cool to Presence of Workers From Asia", "author": "DAN BILEFSKY"}

{"date": "Sun, 06 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 A report on Sri Lanka to be released next week by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee urges a less confrontational approach to that nation, citing strategic American interests in the region.\nThe report says that while the Sri Lankan government has been widely criticized for its handling of the war against the Tamil Tigers, who were fighting for a separate state for the ethnic Tamil minority in northern Sri Lanka, the government has also achieved a measure of progress in resettling the conflict\u2019s displaced and rebuilding the war-shattered east of the country.\n\u201cWith the end of the war, the United States needs to re-evaluate its relationship with Sri Lanka to reflect new political and economic realities,\u201d says the report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. \u201cWhile humanitarian concerns remain important, U.S. policy toward Sri Lanka cannot be dominated by a single agenda. It is not effective at delivering real reform, and it shortchanges U.S. geostrategic interests in the region.\u201d\nThe bipartisan report, which was endorsed by Senator John Kerry, the Democratic chairman of the committee, as well as Senator Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican, is being released as the Obama administration is preparing to announce its new policy on Sri Lanka. It also comes as questions persist about what Western countries can do to influence the government there.\nConcerns about human rights and humanitarian aid for the people affected by the conflict have dominated the relationship between the United States and Sri Lanka over the past few years as the hard-line government in the capital, Colombo, pressed its military offensive against the Tigers.\nThe tough strategy of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka\u2019s president, and his two brothers, Gotabaya and Basil, helped defeat the insurgency in May after more than two decades of war. The rebel group used brutal tactics like the use of child soldiers and female suicide bombers. It was also responsible for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, a former prime minister of India who was hoping to return to power, in 1991.\nGovernment troops overran a narrow strip of beach where the leaders of the rebel group were pinned down, along with about 300,000 Tamil civilians. Human rights groups have pointed to evidence of an indiscriminate use of heavy weapons by government troops in areas crowded with civilians in the last weeks of fighting. The United Nations documented at least 7,000 civilian deaths in a tally that does not include the last, and probably bloodiest, weeks of fighting.\nThe government also faced pressure to release nearly 300,000 Tamils it had held in closed camps since the end of the war. Officials said the displaced people needed to be screened to weed out fighters, but conditions in the crowded camps deteriorated as the monsoon rains arrived. On Tuesday , the government said the displaced were free to leave, with some limitations.\nSri Lanka has resisted calls for an international investigation of its conduct of the war, and has dismissed the demands of the Western countries that have bankrolled much of its humanitarian aid effort as imperialism.\nSri Lankan government officials have repeatedly pointed to growing ties between their country and China as a sign that the West\u2019s influence there is on the wane. Mr. Rajapaksa, who is running for re-election in January \u2014 and is staking his campaign on the war victory \u2014 has accused foreign aid organizations and Western countries of meddling in Sri Lanka\u2019s affairs.\nMore broadly, government officials have expressed dismay at the barrage of criticism they received abroad after the defeat of the Tamil Tigers. Mr. Rajapaksa portrayed the conflict as part of a global fight against terrorism, and the victory over the Tigers as a model for anti-insurgency military campaigns elsewhere. Sri Lankan officials deny that large numbers of civilians were killed by government troops.\nThe United States and other Western countries abstained from a vote at the International Monetary Fund in July to lend $2.6 billion to Sri Lanka. The United States has also curbed military aid because of concerns about human rights abuses in the war against the Tamil Tigers.\nBut Sri Lanka is too important a country to be isolated from the West, the report argues.\n\u201cSri Lanka is located at the nexus of crucial maritime trading routes in the Indian Ocean connecting Europe and the Middle East to China and the rest of Asia,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe United States, India, and China all share an interest in deterring terrorist activity and curbing piracy that could disrupt maritime trade.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/world/asia/07lanka.html", "title": "U.S. Report on Sri Lanka Urges New Approach", "author": "LYDIA POLGREEN"}

They came just two days after Iraq said it would lift all blast walls from Baghdad\u2019s main roads \u2014 and the head of Baghdad\u2019s operations command, Maj. Gen. Abud Qanbar, declared that \u201csecurity is not an issue anymore\u201d \u2014 and one week after five Shiite mosques in Baghdad were bombed in coordinated attacks, killing at least 29.\nThe deadliest bombing on Friday took place at a Shiite Turkmen mosque on the northern fringes of the seething city of Mosul. A Kia truck packed with explosives was detonated while the mosque and an adjacent hall used for funeral services were filled with people, killing at least 37 people and wounding 276, the governor, Atheel al-Nujaifi, told reporters.\nMr. Nujaifi and his brother Osama, a member of Parliament, blamed the negligence of Iraqi security forces for the attack and called on the central government to declare the area a disaster zone.\nOther officials and some witnesses said the truck was driven by a suicide bomber.\nRaad al-Zubaie, a volunteer with the Iraqi Red Crescent who helped rescue the victims at the scene, said at least 10 houses were leveled in the bombing, which happened in the village of Shirakhan, four miles north of Mosul.\nIt was the second devastating attack to strike near Shiite Turkmen mosques in recent months. In June, a truck bomb exploded as worshipers left Friday Prayer in the contested city of Kirkuk, killing 80 people and wounding 300.\nMosul is among the most violent places in Iraq, home to insurgents linked to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a mostly homegrown militant group with some foreign leadership, and to the banned Baath Party, once led by Saddam Hussein. Under the security agreement between Iraq and the United States, most American forces have withdrawn from outposts in the city and are now garrisoned at a base.\nComplicating the situation is a bitter power struggle between Sunni Arab and Kurdish political factions in surrounding Nineveh Province, which is home to a mosaic of ethnic and religious groups.\nMost of the wounded in Friday\u2019s mosque bombing were rushed to hospitals in central Mosul.\n\u201cThe ceiling of my house collapsed on me and my family,\u201d said Jasim Haidar, 41, who lived near the mosque. \u201cPeople rescued us from under the rubble.\u201d\nMehdi Jala, 39, said he did not know if his son was dead or alive. They had gone to the mosque together to pray. Wael Shakib, 24, was missing three sisters and two nephews.\nDildar Zebari, the deputy chairman of the local provincial council, said that while the bombing could have been carried out by an extremist Sunni group, it was conceivable that a political party that he refused to name might have \u201ccommissioned\u201d the attack to make the current government look bad.\n\u201cCertain political parties could resort to violence and masquerade as terrorist organizations,\u201d he said, \u201cto maintain the state of instability in Nineveh Province.\u201d\nMr. Zebari, a Kurd, belongs to Al Hadba, a mainly Sunni Arab coalition led by Mr. Nujaifi, the governor. It swept into power in Mosul after January\u2019s provincial elections and has shut out a coalition led by the Kurdistan Democratic Party (K.D.P.), one of Iraq\u2019s two main Kurdish parties, from all senior posts.\nIn return, the K.D.P., which controls several areas north and east of Mosul through the presence of Kurdish security forces brought over from the adjacent semiautonomous Kurdistan region, has pressed residents not to recognize the authority of the provincial government.\nIn Baghdad on Friday, a roadside bomb planted near Hamza Square in the Sadr City district ripped through a minibus carrying pilgrims returning from the holy city of Karbala. Three people were killed and eight wounded, according to an official at the Interior Ministry, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.\nAn hour later, two roadside bombs exploded simultaneously in the path of other minibuses transporting pilgrims in and around Sadr City, killing 3 people and wounding 16, the official said.\nLater on Friday evening, a motorcycle rigged with explosives was detonated in a busy cooperative food market in Baghdad\u2019s western neighborhood of Al Khadra. At least six people were killed and 30 wounded, according to the Interior Ministry official.\nHundreds of thousands of Shiite pilgrims left Karbala on Friday after celebrating the birth of Imam Mahdi, the Shiite saint who is believed to have gone into hiding in the year 873 at the age of 5. Shiites believe he will re-emerge for the salvation of mankind.\nIraq\u2019s state-owned television station, Al Iraqiya, mentioned Friday\u2019s violence in passing while praising at great length the achievements of the nearly 21,000 Iraqi soldiers and police officers in securing the pilgrims in Karbala. American military helicopters provided air cover, the station said.\n\u201cIt was a brilliant and model security plan,\u201d beamed Iraq\u2019s defense minister, Abdul-Kader Jassem al-Obeidi, from Karbala.\nIn his weekly sermon at the Buratha mosque in Baghdad, Sheik Jalaleddin al-Saghir, a cleric and a senior member of Parliament, said a guard had tried to kill Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.\n\u201cRecently, a member of the prime minister\u2019s own private security detail wanted to assassinate the prime minister,\u201d said Sheik Saghir, a leader in the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq party, which is part of Mr. Maliki\u2019s governing Shiite coalition. \u201cIt was someone from his inner circle, and the prime minister told me this.\u201d\nSheik Saghir did not provide other details, and Ali al-Adeeb, a senior member of Mr. Maliki\u2019s Dawa Party, said he had not heard about such an attempt.\nNone of Mr. Maliki\u2019s aides and advisers could be reached for comment.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/world/middleeast/08iraq.html", "title": "Attacks on Shiites Kill Scores in Iraq", "author": "SAM DAGHER"}

There are problems with the schools, the health care system and the government bureaucracy, which is plagued by corruption and inefficiency. Untreated sewage is dumped right into the Mediterranean.\nLibya is a police state, but the trains still do not run on time.\n\u201cThe administration has failed and the state economy has failed, enough is enough,\u201d Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi said in a recent speech that made no mention of his own role as the man in charge for the last 40 years.\nLibya recognizes its problems and is trying to respond, after a fashion. But whatever Libya does, it must stay within the boundaries of a system created by Colonel Qaddafi, or Brother Leader, as he is called. And that is the country\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel: by nearly every practical measure, the system has failed Libyans, but it is his system, so it is above reproach.\nAs eager as Colonel Qaddafi and Libyans are to rejoin the contemporary world, to just become a normal country, they are likely to be frustrated as long as it remains impossible to fundamentally reform the system imposed by Libya\u2019s absolute ruler.\n\u201cIt is all him, because there are no institutions in Libya to share his power or challenge his behavior,\u201d said Attia Essawy, an Egyptian writer with expertise in Libyan affairs.\nIn many ways, Libya is a case study in how power tends to corrupt. Last month, Colonel Qaddafi offered a formula for fixing his hobbled state. His idea was to abolish the government altogether and give all the oil proceeds directly to each family. Abdul Mahjeed el-Dorsi, director of Libya\u2019s foreign media department, explained: \u201cThe government will be demolished, it will disappear. You will take your share of the wealth and you can go to private schools, universities. They will have to manage everything themselves.\u201d\nThe idea frightened many Libyans, who said they wanted a more permanent, professional government but were not ready to blow up the current one. But there was no indication that the transformation would be happening anytime soon.\nThe minister of economics, Ali Abd Alaziz Isawi, took the most optimistic view. He said the only way to build an effective, accountable government would be to start over, even if that meant a period of chaos. A week after making those remarks, he was fired.\nThe New York Times was invited to Libya to spend about two weeks observing what officials here bill as direct democracy. Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s idea is that representative democracy is inadequate because it involves citizens assigning their rights and responsibilities to someone else. In Libya, the theory goes, everyone is involved in every decision. People meet in committees and vote on everything from foreign treaties to building schools.\nAuthoritarian leaders all over the world take steps to create a veneer of democracy. In Egypt, for example, there are elections, though there is never any doubt that the governing party will win.\nLibya outdoes almost all of them.\nHere, tens of thousands of people take part in meetings to discuss issues that are decided by a small group at the top, with all direction coming from the Brother Leader.\n\u201cHe makes the decisions,\u201d said a high-ranking diplomat in Tripoli, the capital, who is not being identified to avoid compromising his ability to work here. \u201cHe is the only one who knows.\u201d\nReporters from The Times watched as committees around Tripoli discussed Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s plan to abolish the government. After the perfunctory poetic genuflecting to the leader, more than half the speakers said they did not want money, they wanted a functioning government. They were angry and heartbroken that such a resource-rich nation, a member of OPEC, could be performing so poorly.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need money,\u201d said Nadia Ali, 35, at one of the forums in Tripoli. \u201cWe need roads, we need health care, we need education, we need an economy.\u201d\nBut for all the venting, there was no mention of the fundamental issue facing the country \u2014 that the system needs fixing.\nWhen things do get done, it is often without planning or coordination. Almost two dozen high-rise towers are being constructed along the Tripoli beach front \u2014 apparently a sign of progress \u2014 but a development official said there were no provisions for parking, roads or sewage.\nMinistries rarely talk to one another, many people here said. The minister of economics, trade and investment sits in a building at the end of a rutted dirt field. Where are the roads?\nAs the committee meetings carried on, two young men sat inside a small shop watching television, uninterested in the proceedings. One of them said: \u201cIf they issue anything it will not be implemented. This is what we\u2019re used to.\u201d\nThe other man completed the thought: \u201cAnd if they really wanted to distribute any wealth, they can just distribute it without this whole charade.\u201d\nThe men gave their names, but they are not being identified to protect them from retaliation. The police here do not tolerate public criticism, and people still disappear in the night.\nThe stated goal of the committee meetings is to build a national consensus. Representatives from all 700-plus committees around the country gather a few times each year in the coastal city of Surt to pass laws based on what the people said in their local meetings. Every time Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s name is mentioned, there is applause.\nAt this year\u2019s meeting in Surt, the participants ultimately decided to endorse the leader\u2019s call for distributing the oil wealth but to delay carrying it out until a workable strategy could be devised. In the interim, state spending was increased by a whopping 30 percent.\nWhether more money would help move Libya forward seemed debatable since that was not the problem that was described. The problem was spending the money the right way.\n\u201cDespite all the billions spent on all sectors, billions of dollars since the revolution until today,\u201d said one participant, Muhammad Furaij of Misratah, during the Surt meeting, \u201cwhy is health so deteriorated? Why is education so neglected?\u201d\nHe was, of course, careful where he placed the blame.\n\u201cThe leader has never guided us in any direction except to serve the interests of the Libyan people,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/world/africa/20libya.html", "title": "A Leader Beyond Reproach Limits the Possibilities for Political Change", "author": "MICHAEL SLACKMAN"}

Describing a \u201ca troubling undercurrent of anti-Semitism in the situation in Honduras,\u201d the league\u2019s national director, Abraham H. Foxman, said that Jews appeared to have become a \u201cconvenient scapegoat\u201d during a period of turmoil.\nMr. Romero, a host for Radio Globo, which supports the ousted President, Manuel Zelaya, said on Sept. 25: \u201cThere are times when I ask myself if Hitler was or was not correct in finishing with that race with the famous Holocaust. If there is a people that do damage in this country, they are Jewish, they are Israelis.\u201d\nMr. Zelaya has sought to distance himself from anti-Semitism, noting in an open letter last week that he had appointed four Jewish cabinet members.\nOn Monday, the United States ambassador in Tegucigalpa joined the criticism, writing to the radio station\u2019s owner, Alejandro Villatoro, to ask him to denounce what he called \u201cthis appalling act.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Romero\u2019s commentary makes a mockery of any pretense he may have of solidarity with people who struggle against injustice,\u201d the ambassador, Hugo Llorens, wrote. He noted that Mr. Villatoro and Mr. Romero had sought his help last week after the police shut down the station under an emergency decree.\nRadio Globo\u2019s programming has helped mobilize resistance to the de facto government that took office after Mr. Zelaya was deposed and exiled in a coup on June 28.

{"date": "Mon, 26 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KUNDUZ, Afghanistan \u2014 Forced to confront the rising insurgency in once peaceful northern Afghanistan, the German Army is engaged in sustained and bloody ground combat for the first time since World War II.\nSoldiers near the northern city of Kunduz have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by Taliban insurgents, while carrying the burden of being among the first units to break the German taboo against military combat abroad that arose after the Nazi era.\nAt issue are how long opposition in Germany will allow its troops to stay and fight, and whether they will be given leeway from their strict rules of engagement to pursue the kind of counterinsurgency being advocated by American generals. The question now is whether the Americans will ultimately fight one kind of war and their allies another.\nFor Germans, the realization that their soldiers are now engaged in ground offensives in an open-ended and escalating war requires a fundamental reconsideration of their principles.\nAfter World War II, German society rejected using military power for anything other than self-defense, and pacifism has been a rallying cry for generations, blocking allied requests for any military support beyond humanitarian assistance.\nGerman leaders have chipped away at the proscriptions in recent years, in particular by participating in airstrikes in the Kosovo war. Still, the legacy of the combat ban remains in the form of strict engagement rules and an ingrained shoot-last mentality that is causing significant tensions with the United States in Afghanistan.\nDriven by necessity, some of the 4,250 German soldiers here, the third-largest number of troops in the NATO contingent, have already come a long way. Last Tuesday, they handed out blankets, volleyballs and flashlights as a goodwill gesture to residents of the village of Yanghareq, about 22 miles northwest of Kunduz. Barely an hour later, insurgents with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades ambushed other members of the same company.\nThe Germans fought back, killing one of the attackers, before the dust and disorder made it impossible to tell fleeing Taliban from civilians.\n\u201cThey shoot at us and we shoot back,\u201d said Staff Sgt. Erik S., who, according to German military rules, could not be fully identified. \u201cPeople are going to fall on both sides. It\u2019s as simple as that. It\u2019s war.\u201d\nThe sergeant added, \u201cThe word \u2018war\u2019 is growing louder in society, and the politicians can\u2019t keep it secret anymore.\u201d\nIndeed, German politicians have refused to utter the word, trying instead to portray the mission in Afghanistan as a mix of peacekeeping and reconstruction in support of the Afghan government. But their line has grown less tenable as the insurgency has expanded rapidly in the west and north of the country, where Germany leads the regional command and provides a majority of the troops.\nThe Germans may not have gone to war, but now the war has come to them.\nIn part, NATO and German officials say, that is evidence of the political astuteness of Taliban and Qaeda leaders, who are aware of the opposition in Germany to the war. They hope to exploit it and force the withdrawal of German soldiers \u2014 splintering the NATO alliance in the process \u2014 through attacks on German personnel in Afghanistan and through video and audio threats of terrorist attacks on the home front before the German elections last month.\nGen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the senior American and allied commander in Afghanistan, is pressing NATO allies to contribute more troops to the war effort, even as countries like the Netherlands and Canada have begun discussing plans to pull out. Germany has held out against pleas for additional troops so far.\nTies between Germany and the United States were strained last month over a German-ordered bombing of two hijacked tanker trucks, which killed civilians as well as Taliban. Many Germans, from top politicians down to enlisted men, thought that General McChrystal was too swift to condemn the strike before a complete investigation.\nGermany\u2019s combat troops are caught in the middle. In interviews last week, soldiers from the Third Company, Mechanized Infantry Battalion 391, said they were understaffed for the increasingly complex mission here. Two men from the company were killed in June, among 36 German soldiers who have died in the Afghan war.\nThe soldiers expressed frustration over the second-guessing of the airstrike not only by allies, but also by their own politicians, and over the absence of support back home.\nWhile the intensity of the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan\u2019s south has received most attention, the situation in the Germans\u2019 part of the north has deteriorated rapidly. Soldiers said that just a year ago they could patrol in unarmored vehicles. Now there are places where they cannot move even in armored vehicles without an entire company of soldiers.\nAmerican officials have argued that an emphasis on reconstruction, peacekeeping and the avoidance of violence may have given the Taliban a foothold to return to the north.\nGerman officers here said they had adjusted their tactics accordingly, often engaging the Taliban in firefights for hours with close air support. In July, 300 German soldiers joined the Afghan Army and National Police in an operation in Kunduz Province that killed more than 20 Taliban fighters and led to the arrests of half a dozen more.\nThe German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called the operation \u201ca fundamental transition out of the defensive and into the offensive.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s military actions are controlled by a parliamentary mandate, which is up for renewal in December. The German contingent has unarmed drones and Tornado fighter jets, which are restricted to reconnaissance and are not allowed to conduct offensive operations.\nGerman soldiers usually stay in Afghanistan for just four months, which can make it difficult to maintain continuity with their Afghan partners. The mandate also caps the number of troops in the country at 4,500.\nA NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, called the mandate \u201ca political straitjacket.\u201d\nA company of German paratroopers in the district of Chahar Darreh, where insurgent activity is particularly pronounced, fought off a series of attacks and stayed in the area, patrolling on foot and meeting with local elders for eight days and seven nights.\n\u201cThe longer we were out there, the better the local population responded to us,\u201d said Capt. Thomas K., the company\u2019s commander.

{"date": "Sat, 27 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MARDAN, Pakistan \u2014 For the past month and a half, the Pakistani military has claimed success in retaking the Swat Valley from the Taliban, clawing back its own territory from insurgents who only a short time ago were extending their reach toward the heartland of the country.\nYet from a helicopter flying low over the valley last week, the low-rise buildings of Mingora, the largest city in Swat, now deserted and under a 24-hour curfew, appeared unscathed. In the surrounding countryside, farmers had harvested wheat and red onions on their unscarred land.\nAll that is testament to the fact that the Taliban mostly melted away without a major fight, possibly to return when the military withdraws or to fight elsewhere, military analysts say. About two million people have been displaced in Swat and the surrounding area as the military has carried out its campaign.\nThe reassertion of control over Swat has at least temporarily denied the militants a haven they coveted inside Pakistan proper. The offensive has also won strong support from the United States, which has urged Pakistan to engage the militants.\nBut the Taliban\u2019s decision to scatter leaves the future of Swat, and Pakistan\u2019s overall stability, under continued threat, military analysts and some politicians say.\nThe tentative results in Swat also do not bode well for the military\u2019s new push in the far more treacherous terrain of South Waziristan, another insurgent stronghold, where officials have vowed to take on the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, who remains Pakistan\u2019s most wanted man.\nSigns abound that the military\u2019s campaign in Swat is less than decisive. The military extended its deadline for ending the campaign. Even in the areas where progress has been made, the military controls little more than urban centers and roads, say those who have fled the areas. The military has also failed to kill or capture even one top Taliban commander.\nIt was \u201cvery disappointing,\u201d said Aftab Ahmed Sherpao, a senior politician from the region, that none of the commanders had been eliminated. It turned out, he said, that early reports of the capture of Ibn Amin, a particularly brutal commander from Matta, were incorrect.\nMany Taliban fighters have infiltrated the camps set up for those displaced by the fighting and are likely to return with them to Swat, said Himayatullah Mayar, the mayor of Mardan, the city where many of the refugees are staying. \u201cMost of the Taliban shaved their beards, and they are living here with their families,\u201d he said.\nAs of two weeks ago, the police had arrested 150 people in the camps suspected of being members of the Taliban, Mr. Mayar said. This figure did not include suspects arrested by the Intelligence Bureau, Pakistan\u2019s domestic intelligence outfit, and the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, the country\u2019s main spy agency, he said.\nMeanwhile, the government, led by President Asif Ali Zardari, has yet to announce a full plan for how it will provide services like courts, policing and health care that will allow the refugees to return home and the government to fully assert control.\nThose plans appear to be mired in conflict and mutual suspicion between the military and the civilian government, raising serious questions about whether the authorities can secure Swat and other areas and keep them from being taken back by the Taliban, military experts said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve told the president and the prime minister and the chief of the army this is the time to act. Just take basic things and implement them,\u201d said Gen. Nadeem Ahmad, the commander of the Special Support Group, an arm of the Pakistani military that is providing temporary buildings and some food for the displaced. \u201cThis is not talking rocket science.\u201d\nOn a notepad, General Ahmad had drawn a chart of the four elements of what he called \u201clasting peace.\u201d They were good government; improved delivery of services, including rebuilt schools; speedy justice (something the Taliban had provided); and social equity.\nHe appeared to be skeptical that those aspects could be delivered within what he called an essential one-year time frame. He said he had warned the leaders: \u201cIf you don\u2019t deliver, it will be trouble. You will come back and do the operation again.\u201d\nHaving witnessed past episodes of deal-making with the Taliban, the people of Swat say they want tangible proof that the military is serious this time and that they will be safe if they return home.\nFrom the start, a rallying cry has been a demand that the army kill or capture Taliban leaders, a ruthless group of highly trained fighters, some with links to Al Qaeda. But the army has not been able to show any evidence that it killed any of the Taliban leaders.\nThe daily newspaper The News said in a recent editorial that unless Maulana Fazlullah, the Taliban\u2019s main commander in Swat, and Mr. Mehsud, the country\u2019s top enemy, were captured, \u201cthe Taliban are going to live to fight another day.\u201d\nIndeed, most of the damage from the recent fighting appears confined to small agricultural hamlets outside Mingora, according to interviews with displaced people. Some said they had heard from recent arrivals to the camps that areas 500 yards off the roads remained in control of the militants.\nThe \u201coutlook was bleak\u201d in Swat because the civilian government did not have the money or the skills to rebuild, said Shuja Nawaz, the author of a history of the Pakistani military and now the director of the South Asia Center at the Atlantic Council in Washington.\nMost of the two million displaced people are still living in tent camps and cramped quarters with relatives and even strangers, in cities as far flung as the southern port of Karachi.\nMany displaced people were fed up with the cruelties inflicted under Taliban rule and have backed the military campaign. But as the fighting drags on in places, the mood among them grows increasingly despondent.\nSome displaced people said that they were angry at the army for indiscriminate shelling in civilian areas. Others said they were confused about why the military operation was even necessary.\n\u201cWe had no problem with the Taliban,\u201d Umar Ali, a poultry trader from Qambar in Swat, said as he sat on the veranda of a home in Swabi, a town filled with displaced people. \u201cWe\u2019re here because of the military shelling. I\u2019m a trader, and the thing that affects my life is the curfew.\u201d\nEarlier Pakistani campaigns against the Taliban do not offer an encouraging precedent. In Bajaur, a part of the tribal areas, two main economic centers, the market towns of Loe Sam and Inayat Kalay, remain in ruins nearly eight months after the army smashed them in pursuit of the Taliban and claimed victory.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/world/asia/28swat.html", "title": "Taliban Losses Are No Sure Gain for Pakistanis", "author": "JANE PERLEZ and PIR ZUBAIR SHAH"}

At least 50 militants were killed, but the exact number remains disputed. The siege has since become a rallying cry for militants who have retaliated in attacks against the government.\nSince he was apprehended, Mr. Aziz has been held under house arrest in Rawalpindi, the garrison city next to the capital. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court set his bail at $2,500, in a charge related to illegally occupying a children\u2019s library adjacent to the Red Mosque, his lawyer said.\n\u201cThe court observed that in absence of evidence a person cannot be held indefinitely on the basis of mere accusations,\u201d said the lawyer, Mr. Siddiqui. But he said the government might still issue detention orders \u201cusing the pretext that the release can cause a law-and-order situation.\u201d\nThe three-member bench of the Supreme Court that heard the case did not include the newly restored Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.\nAnalysts said the government of President Asif Ali Zardari lacked the political will to go hard after the Islamists, especially at a time when national sentiment was strongly anti-American.\n\u201cIt relates to political will and political constraints,\u201d said Rafia Zakaria, a columnist for the Daily Times. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the game of attempting to co-opt the Islamists so that popular sentiment would be with the government.\u201d\nAt the same time, she said, the new Supreme Court was seemingly intent on reversing what it considered illegal steps taken by the former president, Pervez Musharraf.\n\u201cThis court has political scores to settle,\u201d Ms. Zakaria said. \u201cThe Lal Masjid affair was a debacle and got all sorts of sympathy for the Islamists. The civilian government is obviously trying to make amends.\u201d\nThe siege and subsequent raid of the Red Mosque inflamed militant sentiment in the country. Militants claimed that hundreds of female students had been killed alongside the militants who were fighting the army. The Pakistani military denied it. Mr. Musharraf defended the raid, saying the Red Mosque had become a recruiting ground for terrorists.\nMr. Aziz used to lead Friday Prayer at the mosque. He and his allies had openly challenged government authority in the months before the siege, and had begun a campaign to impose Taliban-style rule in the capital.\nSuicide Bombers Kill 16\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 A suicide bomber detonated a car laden with explosives at a police checkpoint on Wednesday, killing 16 people, in a village not far from Swat, the Taliban stronghold where the government agreed to Islamic law this week, the police and residents of the area said.\nTen of the dead were police officials, including a deputy police chief and another officer who a week ago shot and killed a would-be suicide bomber who tried to strike a political rally, news reports and a police official said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/world/asia/16cleric.html", "title": "Pakistani Court Grants Bail to Cleric Who Led Militants", "author": "SALMAN MASOOD"}

Mr. Secretary-General, dear colleagues.\nGlobal climate change has a profound impact on the survival and development of mankind. It is a major challenge facing all countries.\nI wish to highlight here a few principles that we need to follow in our common endeavor to tackle this issue of climate change. First, fulfilling our respective responsibilities should be at the core of our efforts. The principle of common, but differentiated responsibilities embodies the consensus of the international community. Adherence to this principle is critical to keeping international cooperation on climate change on the right track.\nSecond, achieving mutual benefit and win-win outcomes should be the goal of our effort. Developed countries should support developing countries in tackling climate change. This not only is their responsibility, but also serves their long-term interests.\nWe should make our endeavor on climate change a win-win for both developed and developing countries and a win-win for both the interests of individual countries and the common interests of humanity.\nThird, promoting common development should be the basis of our effort. We should and can only advise our efforts to tackle climate change in the course of development and meeting this challenge is a common development.\nIt is imperative to give full consideration to the development stage and basic needs of developing countries while we address climate change. The international community should pay close attention to the difficulties facing the developing countries, especially the small island states, the least developed countries, landlocked countries and African countries.\nWe should combine our efforts to address climate change with efforts to promote the growth of developing countries and build up their own dynamism for development and their ability for sustainable development.\nFourth, ensuring financing and technology is the key to our success of the effort.\nDeveloped countries should take up their responsibility and provide new, additional, adequate and predictable financial support to developing countries to enable them to have access to climate-friendly technologies.\nDear colleagues, out of a sense of responsibility to its own people and people across the world, China has taken and will continue to take determined and practical steps to tackle this challenge. China has adopted and is implementing its national climate change program. This includes mandatory national targets for reducing energy intensity and discharge of major pollutants and increasing forest coverage and the share of renewable energy for the period of 2005 through 2010.\nIn the years ahead, China will further integrate our actions on climate change into our economic and social development tasks and take the following forceful measures. First, we will intensify our effort to conserve energy and improve energy efficiency. We will endeavor to cut carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 (inaudible) \u2014 GDP by a notable margin by 2020 from the 2005 level.\nSecond, we will vigorously develop renewable energy and nuclear energy. We will endeavor to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 15 percent by 2020.\nThird, we will energetically increase forest carbon \u2014 (inaudible) \u2014 we will endeavor to increase forest coverage by 40 million hectares and forest stock volume by 1.3 billion cubic meters by 2020 from the 2005 levels.\nFourth, we will step up our efforts to develop green economy, low carbon economy and \u2014 (inaudible) \u2014 economy and enhance research, development and dissemination of climate-friendly technologies.\nDear colleagues, China stands ready to work with all countries to build an even better future for the generations to come.\nThank you all.

{"date": "Sun, 10 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s top national security adviser said on Sunday that the United States would likely continue conducting airstrikes against extremists in Afghanistan despite a sharp warning from President Hamid Karzai that civilian casualties were fast turning ordinary Afghans against the United States.\nIn a pre-taped interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Mr. Karzai suggested that the United States risked losing a \u201cmoral\u201d fight against the Taliban if too many civilians died in American attacks. But Mr. Karzai has also come under pressure from the United States for what advisers call inadequate efforts to fight corruption, and received a similar warning on Sunday by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.\nThe security adviser, General James L. Jones, spoke six days after Afghans blamed United States airstrikes in western Afghanistan for the deaths of scores of civilians. American officials apologized for the deaths and said that they are investigating the incident. Still they say that reports of a death toll exceeding 100 were exaggerated and that Taliban militants who were being targeted might have forced civilians to serve as \u201chuman shields.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take a look at trying to make sure we correct those things we can correct, but certainly to tie the hands of our commanders and say we\u2019re not going to conduct airstrikes would be imprudent,\u201d General Jones said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fight with one hand tied behind our back,\u201d he said, without flatly ruling out the possibility of a change in approach.\nLast week, Mr. Karzai and the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, held a three-way meeting with Mr. Obama at the White House while the Pakistani military launched an intense offensive against surging Taliban extremists in the northwest part of that country.\nGeneral David H. Petraeus, who heads the U.S. Central Command, said on Sunday that the United States had real concerns about Pakistan\u2019s survival. But he also said he believed there was \u201cadequate\u201d security around Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\u201cCertainly the next few weeks will be very important in this effort to roll back, if you will, this existential threat, a true threat to Pakistan\u2019s very existence,\u201d he said.\nThe general welcomed the latest Pakistani offensive as qualitatively different from previous efforts to contain militants. The Taliban\u2019s push toward Islamabad, he told \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d \u201cseems to have galvanized all of Pakistan, not just the president and prime minister.\u201d\nGeneral Petraeus said he was also heartened that Pakistan had shifted some forces from the east, where they face India, to the northwest, as United States officials had urged.\nHe also said he had named a brigadier general to study the use of airstrikes in Afghanistan.\nIn a lengthy meeting in Berlin, Mrs. Merkel warned Mr. Karzai to crack down on corruption and improve security in northern Afghanistan, where more than 3,800 German soldiers are based.\n\u201cThe Karzai government needed to act more decisively against corruption,\u201d said Eckhart von Klaeden, foreign policy spokesman for Mrs. Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc.\nThe Merkel government fears that the Taliban might increasingly target German soldiers, as German federal elections in September near, to pressure Berlin to withdraw all its troops. Polls show most Germans would support a withdrawal, though they also support Mr. Obama, who is increasing the United States effort in Afghanistan.\nIn 2002, the Social Democrat chancellor Gerhard Schroder was narrowly re-elected after running a strong anti-war and anti-U.S. campaign. That led to a serious rift with the United States that took years to heal.\nDespite her concerns, Mrs. Merkel told reporters that Germany would continue its military engagement in Afghanistan and would put more effort into training Afghan police.\nIn his pretaped interview, Mr. Karzai said: \u201cOur villages are not where the terrorists are. And that\u2019s what we kept telling the U.S. administration.\n\u201cCivilian casualties are undermining support in the Afghan people for the war on terrorism and for the relations with America. How can you expect a people who keep losing their children to remain friendly?\u201d\n\u201cThe people are still with us,\u201d Mr. Karzai added. \u201cBut there is a limit.\u201d\nGeneral Jones suggested, however, that the Afghan president knew that airstrikes were unlikely to end.\n\u201cI think he understands we have to have a full complement of our offensive military power when we need it,\u201d the general said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/11/world/asia/11karzai.html", "title": "U.S. Adviser Holds Firm on Airstrikes in Afghanistan", "author": "BRIAN KNOWLTON and JUDY DEMPSEY"}

Bloomberg helped announce the findings.\nThe 287-page report is based on data from a 2008 survey of 178 countries, representing 98 percent of the world\u2019s population. It builds on a 2004 report that estimated that 1.27 million people die and that 20 million to 50 million were injured annually in traffic accidents.\nAmong the new findings: pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcycle riders make up almost half of the deaths.\nCreating and enforcing laws that require seat belts and helmets and punish drunken driving is a proven, cost-effective injury prevention strategy, said Dr. Kelly Henning, director of global health programs at Bloomberg Philanthropies. The foundation has invested in pilot road-safety programs in Mexico and Vietnam.\nAccording to the health organization, about 90 percent of traffic injuries occur in developing countries, and the majority of victims are young, suggesting large economic losses for poor countries.\nIn addition to causing tremendous personal suffering, traffic deaths and injuries can impoverish families and burden already strained health systems, said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of injury and violence prevention programs at the health organization.\n\u201cVery few people realize that this is one of the leading causes of death in the world, and the leading cause of death for young people,\u201d Dr. Krug said. \u201cBecause it happens one by one, here and there and not in mass events, it gets less attention.\u201d\nThe report compiled new data on registered vehicles, traffic laws, enforcement, accidents, injuries and deaths, but data remains incomplete for most of the developing world, Dr. Krug said.\n\u201cHowever,\u201d Dr. Krug said, \u201cwe know from anecdotal evidence that in some hospitals and surgical wards, almost half of the surgery beds are occupied by victims of road traffic crashes.\u201d\nHistorically, traffic deaths have increased with a nation\u2019s economic growth, but poorer countries can incorporate safety strategies into transportation and infrastructure plans now to avoid this pattern, said Tony Bliss, lead road safety specialist at the World Bank.\n\u201cIf we could successfully, over the next 10 or 15 years, turn this around, it would be one of the great 21st-century public health achievements,\u201d Mr. Bliss said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/16/world/16traffic.html", "title": "W.H.O.

Mr. Wiens, a German citizen who was born in Russia, admitted to the stabbing but not to a racist motivation.\nThe dispute that led to the killing began a year earlier, in August 2008, on a Dresden playground when Ms. Sherbini asked Mr. Wiens to let her son use a swing he was sitting on. Mr. Wiens made racist insults against Ms. Sherbini, who wore a head scarf, calling her a \u201cterrorist\u201d and an \u201cIslamist.\u201d\nMs. Sherbini called the police. It was after she appeared as a witness in the case that Mr. Wiens took a seven-inch knife from his backpack and attacked her and her husband, Elwy Okaz, in the courtroom.\nMr. Wiens stabbed Ms. Sherbini at least 16 times, the police said, and her husband at least 15 times. The police, responding to calls for help, mistakenly shot Mr. Okaz in the leg instead of the attacker.\nThe shooting of Mr. Okaz, a research scientist, was just one of many details, including the lax security at the courthouse and a week of silence about the case by the German government, that led to an outcry in the Arab and Muslim worlds, where Ms. Sherbini was sometimes known as the \u201chead scarf martyr.\u201d\nProtesters chanted, \u201cDown with Germany\u201d on the streets in Egypt, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran denounced the country\u2019s \u201cbrutality.\u201d\nMs. Sherbini\u2019s father, Ali al-Sherbini, was quoted by the independent newspaper El Shorouk on Thursday as saying he was shocked by the court\u2019s exoneration of police officers who shot Mr. Okaz and of court officers who failed to prevent the killing.\nBy contrast, Ramzy Ezzeldin Ramzy, the Egyptian ambassador to Germany, praised the judge and the prosecution, both for their conduct and for handing down the maximum sentence possible under German law, but he said that the uproar in the days after the murder was understandable.\n\u201cMistakes may have been made,\u201d Mr. Ramzy said in a telephone interview from Dresden, \u201cbut at the end of the day, justice has been served.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/world/europe/13germany.html", "title": "Egypt Welcomes Life Sentence for Killing in German Court", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH"}

Parliament issued a statement expressing broad gratitude over the June 12 vote and thanking the police and the Basij militia for maintaining security.

The authorities continued to detain hundreds of journalists, former government officials, political activists and even independent researchers, in the quest to prevent any further demonstrations.\nThere seemed little prospect of any chance for organized and sustained action against the government\u2019s version of events, political analysts said, in part because the arrests had starved the opposition of leadership, foot soldiers and an effective means to communicate.\nOne of the most recent arrests, of Bijan Khajehpour, an independent political economist, sent a chill deeper yet into Iran\u2019s civil society because he had not been involved in the opposition demonstrations, political analysts said.\nMr. Khajehpour had been detained at the airport coming into the country from Britain, and like many others, has disappeared into the notorious Evin prison, raising concerns over the scope of the crackdown and the prospect of a political purge, the analysts said.\n\u201cBijan was perhaps the last independent-minded analyst living in Tehran who continued to travel to Europe and the U.S. and give open lectures about Iran,\u201d said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cHe always believed that if he was totally transparent, the government would understand he was not doing anything wrong.\u201d\nThe government has also, over the past several days, fired high-ranking officials who had supported Mir Hussein Moussavi, the president\u2019s main challenger, according to Iranian news reports.\nHuman rights groups said arrests had taken place around the nation, but there were particular fears that those held at Evin were in physical danger.\nAmnesty International said in a statement that it was \u201cgravely concerned that several opposition leaders detained in the wake of the 12 June elections may be facing torture, possibly to force them to make televised \u2018confessions\u2019 as a prelude to unfair trials in which they could face the death penalty.\u201d\nReporters Without Borders, a press freedom organization, said that the concern extended beyond opposition leaders. \u201cSeveral witness accounts makes us fear that torture and ill treatment are being systematically inflicted on prisoners who have demonstrated against the regime,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cSeveral journalists and bloggers were brutally treated by the guards and by men employed by the state prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi.\u201d\nThe Guardian Council\u2019s validation of the election on Monday followed days of promises that a committee would be formed to review the election and that a partial recount would occur. But the committee was never seated, nor was the review process established.\nThe recount involved what officials said was a random 10 percent of ballots in Tehran\u2019s 22 electoral districts and in some provinces. The officials concluded that in some areas, Mr. Ahmadinejad had won even more votes than initially stated.\nWith the vote now officially over, the government pressed forward with its efforts to rewrite a narrative of events that had been cast first by the millions who took to the streets, and then through independent and citizen journalism. The government has made reporting inside the country impossible, forcing foreign journalists to leave, while arresting and threatening Iranians who challenge the government\u2019s position.\nThe government maintains that Western agents, primarily Britons, have been responsible for the unrest. On Monday, the government sought to recast blame for the deaths of about 17 protesters.\nThe commander of Iran\u2019s Basij militia, Hossein Taeb, said that impostors wearing Basij uniforms had been responsible for infiltrating crowds attacking unarmed citizens. He also suggested that a Basij impostor had been responsible for killing Neda Agha-Soltan, the young woman who became an international symbol when video of her shot and dying in the street went on the Internet and was seen around the world.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/world/middleeast/01iran.html", "title": "Iran Seeks to Close Door on Further Protests", "author": "MICHAEL SLACKMAN"}
{"date": "Sun, 19 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "C.I.A. interrogators used waterboarding, the near-drowning technique that top Obama administration officials have described as illegal torture, 266 times on two key prisoners from Al Qaeda, far more than had been previously reported.\nThe C.I.A. officers used waterboarding at least 83 times in August 2002 against Abu Zubaydah, according to a 2005 Justice Department legal memorandum. Abu Zubaydah has been described as a Qaeda operative.\nA former C.I.A. officer, John Kiriakou, told ABC News and other news media organizations in 2007 that Abu Zubaydah had undergone waterboarding for only 35 seconds before agreeing to tell everything he knew.\nThe 2005 memo also says that the C.I.A. used waterboarding 183 times in March 2003 against Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-described planner of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\nThe New York Times reported in 2007 that Mr. Mohammed had been barraged more than 100 times with harsh interrogation methods, causing C.I.A. officers to worry that they might have crossed legal limits and to halt his questioning. But the precise number and the exact nature of the interrogation method was not previously known.\nThe release of the numbers is likely to become part of the debate about the morality and efficacy of interrogation methods that the Justice Department under the Bush administration declared legal even though the United States had historically treated them as torture.\nPresident Obama plans to visit C.I.A. headquarters Monday and make public remarks to employees, as well as meet privately with officials, an agency spokesman said Sunday night. It will be his first visit to the agency, whose use of harsh interrogation methods he often condemned during the presidential campaign and whose secret prisons he ordered closed on the second full day of his presidency.\nC.I.A. officials had opposed the release of the interrogation memo, dated May 30, 2005, which was one of four secret legal memos on interrogation that Mr. Obama ordered to be released last Thursday.\nMr. Obama said C.I.A. officers who had used waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods with the approval of the Justice Department would not be prosecuted. He has repeatedly suggested that he opposes Congressional proposals for a \u201ctruth commission\u201d to examine Bush administration counterterrorism programs, including interrogation and warrantless eavesdropping.\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee has begun a yearlong, closed-door investigation of the C.I.A. interrogation program, in part to assess claims of Bush administration officials that brutal treatment, including slamming prisoners into walls, shackling them in standing positions for days and confining them in small boxes, was necessary to get information.\nThe fact that waterboarding was repeated so many times may raise questions about its effectiveness, as well as about assertions by Bush administration officials that their methods were used under strict guidelines.\nA footnote to another 2005 Justice Department memo released Thursday said waterboarding was used both more frequently and with a greater volume of water than the C.I.A. rules permitted.\nThe new information on the number of waterboarding episodes came out over the weekend when a number of bloggers, including Marcy Wheeler of the blog emptywheel, discovered it in the May 30, 2005, memo.\nThe sentences in the memo containing that information appear to have been redacted from some copies but are visible in others. Initial news reports about the memos in The New York Times and other publications did not include the numbers.\nMichael V. Hayden, director of the C.I.A. for the last two years of the Bush administration, would not comment when asked on the program \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d if Mr. Mohammed had been waterboarded 183 times. He said he believed that that information was still classified.\nA C.I.A. spokesman, reached Sunday night, also would not comment on the new information.\nMr. Hayden said he had opposed the release of the memos, even though President Obama has said the techniques will never be used again, because they would tell Al Qaeda \u201cthe outer limits that any American would ever go in terms of interrogating an Al Qaeda terrorist.\u201d\nHe also disputed an article in The New York Times on Saturday that said Abu Zubaydah had revealed nothing new after being waterboarded, saying that he believed that after unspecified \u201ctechniques\u201d were used, Abu Zubaydah revealed information that led to the capture of another terrorist suspect, Ramzi Binalshibh.\nThe Times article, based on information from former intelligence officers who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Abu Zubaydah had revealed a great deal of information before harsh methods were used and after his captors stripped him of clothes, kept him in a cold cell and kept him awake at night. The article said interrogators at the secret prison in Thailand believed he had given up all the information he had, but officials at headquarters ordered them to use waterboarding.\nHe revealed no new information after being waterboarded, the article said, a conclusion that appears to be supported by a footnote to a 2005 Justice Department memo saying the use of the harshest methods appeared to have been \u201cunnecessary\u201d in his case.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/20detain.html", "title": "Waterboarding Used 266 Times on 2 Suspects", "author": "SCOTT SHANE"}

Along with an earlier attack, at least 15 people, including 7 foreigners, were killed, Pakistani security officials said.\nThe stepped-up drone strikes came as the civilian government felt the repercussions of a Supreme Court decision on Wednesday that declared unconstitutional an amnesty for thousands of politicians accused of corruption.\nOn Thursday, the National Accountability Bureau, acting with remarkable speed, prohibited 247 people, including some cabinet ministers, from leaving the country, as corruption cases could be revived against them.\nThey included Defense Minister Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar, who was stopped at the Islamabad airport, along with his wife and secretary, from boarding a flight to China, where he was scheduled to make an official visit. He complained publicly that he had not been informed of the ban.\nThe drone strikes included two missiles that hit at a vehicle in the Datta Khel area of North Waziristan, near the Afghan border, killing at least one person.\nThe second, heavier assault took place at the village of Degan, hometown of a Pakistani Taliban commander, Hafiz Gul Bahadur, and a haven for foreign fighters.\nPakistani officials said the seven foreigners killed were Arabs, including a commander named Zohaib al-Zahidi, though it could be independently verified.\nDegan, a target of previous missile attacks, is about 15 miles west of Miram Shah, capital of North Waziristan, and is within Datta Khel.\nThe United States has stepped up the pace and intensity of its drone attacks in Pakistan this year, which now number more than 40, fanning anti-American sentiment over increased civilian deaths and sensitivities over Pakistani sovereignty.\nWashington has pressed Pakistan to expand military operations to include the area of North Waziristan that the missiles hit Thursday, threatening to attack militants if Islamabad does not.\nThe area is a stronghold of local and foreign fighters allied with Al Qaeda; an Afghan commander, Sirajuddin Haqqani; and Mr. Bahadur, the Pakistani Taliban commander, both of whom are involved in attacks against American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.\nThe Pakistani military has declared a truce with Mr. Bahadur that it deems essential as it battles militants in neighboring South Waziristan. But American officials believe that North Waziristan has become a haven for Afghan and Qaeda commanders, who use it as a staging ground for attacks not only in Afghanistan but also around the world.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/world/asia/18pstan.html", "title": "U.S. Missiles Kill 15 People Near Border in Pakistan", "author": "PIR ZUBAIR SHAH"}

The police recommended that charges be filed against other members of Mr. Ampatuan\u2019s powerful family, including his brother, a governor, and his father, the clan patriarch. The Ampatuan clan wields considerable power in the southern Philippines and is closely allied with the party of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.\nMrs. Arroyo, who has been under intense pressure to take action on the killings, attended a wake Thursday for some of the journalists who were killed and spoke to their relatives. \u201cWe will help in the studies of the children as well in finding justice,\u201d Mrs. Arroyo said.\nThe killings, the worst election-related violence in the country\u2019s history, took place Nov. 23 when relatives of Esmael Mangudadatu, a politician in Maguindanao Province, were intercepted on their way to file Mr. Mangudadatu\u2019s candidacy papers in a governor\u2019s race. The 57 victims \u2014 among them Mr. Mangudadatu\u2019s wife and lawyers, 30 journalists and media workers, and at least 15 motorists who were not part of the convoy and who just happened to be at the checkpoint at the wrong time \u2014 were suspected to have been killed by followers of Mr. Ampatuan. Investigators said Mr. Ampatuan had also sought the governorship \u2014 a job his father currently holds \u2014 and ordered the massacre to prevent Mr. Mangudadatu from pursuing his candidacy .\nMr. Ampatuan faces at least 25 counts of murder. Prosecutors said more charges would be filed as the investigation progressed.\nSince the attack, Ampatuan family members in the capital of Shariff Aguak have found their homes placed under heavy guard, and have been prevented from leaving the premises.\nTheir patriarch, Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., and another of his sons, Zaldy Ampatuan, who is governor of the five-province Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, have been identified as suspects.\nThe Ampatuans have denied that they were behind the massacre and complained that they are being unjustly persecuted. They have asked the courts to issue a restraining order that would prevent the police and the prosecutors from arresting family members without warrants.\nMrs. Arroyo has given broad powers to Reynaldo Puno, the Philippine interior secretary, including the possible suspension from public office of suspects and the possibility of warrantless arrests.\nMr. Espina, the police spokesman, said more than 400 members of the Ampatuan militia have also been disarmed.\nAlso on Thursday, four media groups released the initial report of a fact-finding team formed to investigate the killings. Among the findings were that the authorities had not yet fully confiscated the \u201cenormous weapons arsenal\u201d of the Ampatuan clan and that \u201cfear grips residents near the site, preventing them from speaking out.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/asia/04phils.html", "title": "Inquiry of Philippines Massacre Urged", "author": "CARLOS H.

{"date": "Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KFAR TAPUAH, West Bank \u2014 Thirty Israeli couples are on a waiting list to move into the Kfar Tapuah settlement, which teems with children on the hilltops south of Nablus. Some on the list grew up here. But there is not an apartment available for sale or rent, or even a stifling trailer to be had.\nIf Israel built all the housing units already approved in the nation\u2019s overall master plan for settlements, it would almost double the number of settler homes in the West Bank, according to unpublished official data provided to The New York Times.\nThe decision of whether to build, and how much, goes to the heart of the tensions between the administrations of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Obama, an unaccustomed and no-budge conflict between Israel and the United States. Washington is standing firm against any additional settlement construction in the West Bank, including what Israel argues is necessary to accommodate what it terms \u201cnatural growth.\u201d\nThat term has been defined vaguely by Israeli officials, meaning for some that settlements should expand to accommodate only their own children. But Mr. Netanyahu, of the conservative Likud Party, made his own wider position clear on Monday. He said that while Israel would not allow new settlements and that some small outposts would be removed, building within the confines of established settlements should go on.\nIsrael \u201ccannot freeze life in the settlements,\u201d he said, describing the American call as an \u201cunreasonable\u201d demand.\nAnd in fact, whatever the American demands and Israeli definitions, the reality is that no full freeze seems likely.\nThe issue is, in part, political: Mr. Netanyahu is trying to hold together a fractious coalition, including parties that favor settlement building and oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state. He must contend with an aggressive settler movement, emboldened by support from Israeli governments for decades and determined to continue building, if necessary through unofficial means.\n\u201cIt is important for the world to know we won\u2019t stop,\u201d said Doron Hillel, 29, the settlement council head and one of the first children born here after it was founded about 30 years ago. \u201cThese decrees make things difficult, but they strengthen us. We will continue to build and grow.\u201d\nA partial freeze has been in place for several years, but settlers have found ways around the strictures. Twenty trailer homes have been assembled in Kiryat Arba, near Hebron, for young families over the past year. The Samaria Council, which represents settlers in the northern West Bank, has brought in 150 trailers. Thousands of permanent houses have been illegally constructed within existing settlements, and settlers have recently bulldozed new roads through fields to link up the outposts.\nCritics argue that successive Israeli governments have turned a blind eye to this construction and that they have contributed more broadly to settlement growth.\nThe settlers\u2019 annual population growth, at 5.6 percent, far outstrips the Israeli average of 1.8 percent. But official data from the Central Bureau of Statistics of Israel shows that while about two-thirds of that is a \u201cnatural\u201d increase, as defined by settler births in relation to deaths, one-third stems from migration. There is also a disproportionately high level of state-supported building in the settlements compared with most regions of Israel.\nAnd many critics of the settlement movement dispute the notion that settlers\u2019 children have an absolute right to continue living in their parents\u2019 settlement.\n\u201cA newborn does not need a house,\u201d said Dror Etkes of Yesh Din, an Israeli group that fights for the rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories. \u201cIt is a game the Israeli government is playing\u201d to justify construction, he said.\nUnderlining the competing pressures on Mr. Netanyahu, extremist settlers rioted on Monday in various parts of the northern West Bank, stoning Arab vehicles, burning tires and setting fields alight, according to a witness and the police. They were protesting the government\u2019s recent actions against some tiny outposts. Several Palestinians were wounded. Six Israeli settlers and a rightist member of Parliament were arrested and later released.\nThe Israeli population of the West Bank, not including East Jerusalem, has tripled since the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort started in the early 1990s, and it now approaches 300,000. The settlers live among 2.5 million Palestinians in about 120 settlements, which much of the world considers a violation of international law, as well as in dozens of outposts erected without official Israeli authorization. Israel argues that the settlement enterprise does not violate the law against transferring populations into occupied territories.\nAccording to the newly disclosed data, about 58,800 housing units have been built with government approval in the West Bank settlements over the past 40 years. An additional 46,500 have already obtained Defense Ministry approval within the existing master plans, awaiting nothing more than a government decision to build.\nThe data began to be compiled in 2004 by a retired brigadier general, Baruch Spiegel, at the request of the defense minister at the time, Shaul Mofaz. The Defense Ministry has long refused to make the data public, but it has since been leaked and obtained by nongovernmental groups. Mr. Etkes analyzed the master plans in the Spiegel data, together with a colleague from Bimkom, an Israeli group that focuses on planning and social justice.\nUnder international pressure, construction in the settlements has slowed but never stopped, continuing at an annual rate of about 1,500 to 2,000 units over the past three years. If building continues at the 2008 rate, the 46,500 units already approved will be completed in about 20 years.\nIn Kfar Tapuah, a group of young Israelis who grew up here decided about six years ago that when they married, they would stay. The population has more than doubled since then, to 150 families from 60. Like in other West Bank settlements, nobody counts individuals here: the rate of new births makes that impossible.\nRevitalized from within, the community also attracted young couples from other settlements and from cities in Israel who were seeking a lifestyle that combined relatively cheap suburban comfort with the national-religious ideal of settling the land.\nKfar Tapuah has a reputation as an extremist settlement, having become a base for the followers of the virulently anti-Arab Rabbi Meir Kahane after he was assassinated in 1990. It now seems overrun by young children. A $150,000 state-of-the-art playground recently went up, a second kindergarten just opened and a third is planned.\n\u201cThis is our land from the beginning of days,\u201d said Aviva Herzlich, 67, most of whose 10 children and more than 40 grandchildren live in and around the settlement. \u201cWe do not have anywhere else.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/world/middleeast/02mideast.html", "title": "Israel and U.S. Can\u2019t Close Split on Settlements", "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER"}

And once the money lands in Mexico, it is easily swept into a largely unregulated underground cash economy or laundered through seemingly legitimate businesses.\nAs the United States has tightened bank regulations and clamped down on sophisticated money-laundering schemes in the past 35 years, more of the money from illicit drug sales is being smuggled across the border to Mexico the old-fashioned way, law enforcement officials say.\nAmerican officials say stopping the bulk cash shipments and scuttling money laundering are critical to crippling the cartels in Mexico, which have unleashed a wave of violence that has claimed more than 15,000 lives since President Felipe Calder\u00f3n began cracking down on their operations in December 2006.\nLaw enforcement officials and business owners in Mexico say that the assault on the cartels has driven drug traffickers to branch out into an array of other money-making ventures, setting up businesses like spas and day care centers to launder drug proceeds or selling new products like pirated movies or pilfered oil.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural evolution of criminal activity, just as with the mob in the 1950s,\u201d said John Feeley, the deputy chief of mission of the United States Embassy in Mexico City. \u201cThey can\u2019t continue to work on one illegal product.\u201d\nBut Mexican authorities have yet to make much headway against money launderers, and customs officials say the cash they seize is still a trickle of what flows across the border.\nJoint operations of customs, border patrol and immigration agents set up checkpoints on southbound lanes every day, fishing for money. Customs officials have assigned 25 more teams of dogs and handlers to the task in the past two years.\nMr. Feeley said that he expected Mexico and the United States to devote even more energy to going after the cartels\u2019 profits.\nAlthough United States authorities seized $138 million last year, that amount pales in comparison to the $18 billion to $39 billion a year the Drug Enforcement Agency estimates is being smuggled to Mexico every year.\n\u201cThere is an enormous amount of money that is flowing undetected and uninterdicted,\u201d said John T. Morton, the assistant secretary for immigration and customs enforcement. \u201cWe are trying to be a step ahead of the people moving the money.

The dealers employ spies to spot checkpoints, while informants tip off agents about the movement of cash.\nAcross the Border\nIn Mexico, the cash is relatively easy to launder, law enforcement officials say. Though the Mexican government has tightened bank regulations in the last nine months, drug cartels still buy real estate, businesses, automobiles, jewels and other luxuries in cash without any reports of suspicious activity being made to the government. The sellers then make giant but legal cash deposits to the banks, and the money flows into the economy, Mexican government officials and experts on laundering said.\n\u201cWhen the money is already integrated into the economy it\u2019s very difficult to detect and the players there are not obligated to report it,\u201d said Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda Gibson, a consultant to Mexican banks on money laundering.\nNor is it a crime in Mexico to buy and sell dollars on the street. Thousands of informal money brokers exchange cash, and while they are not allowed to handle more than $10,000 a day per client, the rule is often ignored.\nThe money launderers are still outrunning the Mexican authorities. Though the main agency in the finance ministry charged with tracking money laundering has tripled in size in the past two years, it remains weak and overwhelmed with thousands of reports of questionable activity, officials there say. In the past year, they have referred about 600 cases to prosecutors, but only 18 were presented to the courts.\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t have the capacity yet to do the investigation and make it stick in court,\u201d said Shannon K. O\u2019Neil, a Mexico analyst with the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\nNo one knows precisely how much money is shipped across the border, but Mexican authorities say cash smuggled illegally into their country and then sent back to United States banks through Mexican financial institutions totals at least $10 billion a year.\nA good portion of that is pooled by foreign exchange businesses and then shipped back to United States banks in armored trucks, experts on money laundering said. Money is also smuggled out of Mexico to Colombia and other countries to pay cocaine producers.\nIn September, the Mexican and United States authorities broke up a smuggling ring that had bought a chemical factory and was shipping $41 million from Mexico to Colombia. The cash, in $50 and $100 bills, was hidden in shipping containers holding an industrial chemical.\nThe cartels are also laundering money through such innocuous-sounding enterprises as a car wash in Guadalajara, the Perfect Silhouette spa in Mexico City, the Happy Child day care center in Culiac\u00e1n, and the Biosport health club in Hermosillo, according to the Treasury Department, which has designated scores of such Mexican businesses as cartel operations.\nIn Monterrey, in Mexico\u2019s north, a merchant explained how the Zetas, one of the country\u2019s most feared organized crime groups, turned his small market stall into a wholesaler of pirated products, including movies and CDs. The cartels now produce copies themselves by the hundreds of thousands and sell them under their own label; a unicorn is the Zetas\u2019 symbol.\n\u201cThey tell you, \u2018This store belongs to us now,\u2019 \u201d said the jittery merchant, who insisted on anonymity to avoid the fury of his new bosses. The Zetas even installed closed-circuit cameras to track his sales.\n\u201cThe Zetas pay me a wage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much less than I used to make when I worked for myself, but these are people you do not say no to.\u201d\nIn June, Mexican federal authorities in Monterrey arrested 14 suspects accused of illegally copying movies and music and distributing them in Mexico. The ringleader, identified as Leon Ayala Romero, was dubbed the Zetas\u2019 piracy czar and was accused of sending about $20 million in proceeds to Heriberto Lazcano, the top Zeta commander.\nThe lines between legal and illegal businesses remain fuzzy. Last year, Saulo Reyes Gamboa, 37, a Mexican businessman and police official from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, was sentenced to eight years in an American prison for bribing an undercover federal agent in the United States to ship nearly 2,000 pounds of marijuana to El Paso. The American government seized nearly $20,000 in currency and a vehicle from Mr. Reyes but was unable to get access to most of his other Mexican-based businesses, including Subway franchises, a sushi restaurant and a radio station.\nCat and Mouse\nDrug cartels pay people to make money transfers through companies like Western Union, or simply deposit money in American bank accounts and withdraw it from ATMs in Mexico. Other schemes involve moving money to shell companies, which then buy durable goods like bicycles in the United States and ship them to South America.\nIn a new trend, some organized crime groups have taken to smuggling prepaid money cards rather than cash, law enforcement officials say. United States treasury officials are working to require prepaid cards loaded with more than $10,000 to fall under the same reporting requirements as cash. Right now, anybody can walk or drive across the border with the cards filled with more than $10,000, without breaking any laws.\nIn their continual war of attrition with smugglers, customs officers are using a panoply of new tools: hand-held meters that measure the density of objects, vans with X-ray equipment that scan cars headed to Mexico looking for hidden compartments.\nBut dogs specially trained to sniff out narcotics make the most discoveries. The dogs and their handlers also find money, since most of it has traces of narcotics embedded in its paper. Drugs and cash are often stored or transported in the same compartments.\nThere is an entire cottage industry devoted to building secret compartments in vehicles. Often the compartments will not open unless the driver takes a series of actions like pumping the brakes and turning on the dome light and the radio simultaneously.\nStill, experts on money laundering are skeptical that the seizures, even on the order of more than $100 million a year, can put a dent in a business that counts its income in tens of billions of dollars.\n\u201cThe interdiction program is a waste of all the money we are pouring into it,\u201d said Fletcher N. Baldwin Jr., an expert at the University of Florida. \u201cWe have the longest borders in the world with two other countries, and it\u2019s impossible to police those borders.\u201d\nFederal officials acknowledge that they are hamstrung by the volume of traffic over the Mexican border, both legal and illegal. About 16,000 vehicles cross each way every day in Laredo alone, and customs officials say they do not have enough personnel to adequately police them.\nSpies for smugglers easily locate checkpoints, federal agents say. \u201cWe are always cognizant of spotters,\u201d said Gene Garza, the Laredo port director for Customs and Border Protection. \u201cYou just have to work around it. It\u2019s actually a game we play.\u201d\nThe smugglers are adept players, keeping couriers in the dark about what they are carrying or the inner workings of the cartels.\nIn turn, the agents sometimes choose not to arrest the drivers, turning them loose and following in hopes of ensnaring people further up the chain of command, law enforcement officials said.\nA few drivers agree to become informants. If a seizure is not publicized, the drivers find themselves under tremendous pressure from their bosses to prove they did not steal the money, law enforcement officials say, helping sow discord within the cartels.\n\u201cWhen they lose the money, they cannot just call the guys who paid them the money and say \u2018Can you pay me again?\u2019 \u201d said one longtime Laredo detective, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIt just creates havoc.\u201d\nAgents sometimes have their own troubles proving a driver was smuggling. On Jan. 8, Aristeo Cavelaris Castillo, 32, from the Mexican state of Coahuila, was waved into an inspection station on the Lincoln Juarez Bridge here.\nWhen a drug-sniffing dog became excited, the agents used an X-ray truck to scan his pickup and found $1.3 million in small bills hidden in compartments in the dashboard and the passenger cab.\nBut Mr. Cavelaris claimed he had borrowed the truck from someone he barely knew, and had just used it to do some shopping. Prosecutors dropped the charges without giving a reason.\nProsecutors and investigators declined to comment on specific cases, but said it was sometimes hard to prove the couriers knew the money was there. On the Southwest border, for instance, officers have arrested 95 people for bulk cash smuggling in the past year but have convicted only a third of those.\n\u201cWe have to sometimes let these guys go because they didn\u2019t do anything illegal,\u201d said Stefan Cassella, a prosecutor with the Department of Justice.\nSmugglers often recruit drivers at truck stops to move cash, and keep them ignorant of the details, defense lawyers in Laredo said. In February, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Mart\u00ednez from Nuevo Laredo, just across the border, was caught with $930,000 in a suitcase thrown in the sleeping area of his tractor trailer.\nChristina Flores, a lawyer for Mr. Mart\u00ednez, said he had been approached at a gas station and had been asked to carry the suitcase, with a payment promised after the trip. The smugglers planned to follow his truck in a separate car, she said.\n\u201cHe accepted the proposition,\u201d Ms. Flores said of her client, who pleaded guilty to bulk cash smuggling. \u201cHe had a big mortgage and credit card debt.\u201d\nYet even when couriers plead guilty, they are usually unable to help investigators learn more about how the money laundering or cartels work.\n\u201cA lot of these cases, we find that even with the guys who do cooperate, they don\u2019t know anything,\u201d Mr. Morton said. \u201cThese people are fodder in a larger war.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/world/americas/26laredo.html", "title": "Along U.S.-Mexico Border, a Torrent of Illicit Cash", "author": "JAMES C.

So as the political standoff in Honduras entered a surprising new chapter, the big question Tuesday was how in the world Manuel Zelaya, the deposed and exiled president, managed to sneak back into his country undetected.\nIn a car trunk? With the help of loyal soldiers? In a disguise? Under the protection of other countries? Every option was being considered and debated in Tegucigalpa, where the population is very much divided on Mr. Zelaya.\nHis unexpected appearance at the Brazilian Embassy on Monday certainly surprised the government that ousted him nearly three months ago and had vowed to arrest him on 18 charges if he dared return. After initially denying that Mr. Zelaya had come back, the government was forced to send soldiers and police officers on Tuesday to disperse thousands of Zelaya backers who defied a curfew and massed outside the embassy for a glimpse of their erstwhile leader.\nThat Mr. Zelaya wanted to return was no secret. He buzzed the capital in a small plane on July 4 and stepped several feet across the border later that month from Nicaragua, to the delight of his supporters. In both instances the Honduran military stopped him.\nHow he did so this time and, even more important, whether his presence will help resolve the standoff in his country, are the subject of fierce debate.\n\u201cEveryone has been working hard to reach a peaceful resolution to this crisis,\u201d said a senior State Department official, when asked about Mr. Zelaya\u2019s reappearance. \u201cZelaya\u2019s return was unexpected, and for him to do this without consulting those parties certainly was not helpful. That said, it\u2019s a reality and it could have the effect of forcing people to make decisions they have avoided making \u2014 or it could cause the situation to destabilize.\u201d\nRoberto Micheletti, the de facto president, promised not to storm the Brazilian Embassy, where Mr. Zelaya, in his trademark white cowboy hat, and dozens of friends and family members are now trapped. However, the government did cut off water, electricity and telephone service to the building.\nBut he appealed Tuesday to the international community for dialogue to resolve the crisis, which began June 28 when the military, the courts and the legislature decided that Mr. Zelaya had violated the law by scheming to extend his term beyond that allowed in the Constitution, and therefore had to go. But despite worldwide condemnation of Mr. Zelaya\u2019s removal, Mr. Micheletti has refused to cede power. Elections are to be held Nov. 29 to choose a new president, but many countries have said they will not recognize the results and that Mr. Zelaya must be allowed to serve out his term.\nFrom inside the Brazilian Embassy, Mr. Zelaya described his return to reporters as an arduous 15-hour slog that required trekking through the mountains and navigating back roads in buses, cars and trucks to get around military checkpoints. He said he was helped by a Honduran citizen, whom he refused to name.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t realize when I entered,\u201d Mr. Zelaya said on Honduran radio. \u201cI mocked them.\u201d\nVarious reports have emerged of Mr. Zelaya\u2019s convoluted journey, which may have involved the help of other countries. After initially insisting that Mr. Zelaya was not in Honduras at all but was in a luxury hotel in Nicaragua, Mr. Micheletti said he had learned that the ousted leader had gone through various Central American countries, apparently in an effort to disguise his movements, before entering Honduras.\nAt the border town of El Amatillo, just across from El Salvador, a Honduran immigration agent working the evening that Mr. Zelaya entered the country said she did not see him. \u201cBut there are a lot of moutain passes where he could have crossed,\u201d she said.\nThe Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, citing an unnamed Salvadoran official, reported that Mr. Zelaya was a passenger on a Venezuelan plane that landed without authorization on Sunday night in El Salvador. He was met, it said, by a car belonging to the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, the Salvadoran governing party. Both Venezuela and El Salvador have leftist governments sympathetic to Mr. Zelaya.\nWhere Mr. Zelaya went next, though, no one seemed to know.\nThe Honduran military denied that his return was a major security breach. \u201cMilitary intelligence did not fail,\u201d Adolfo Lionel Sevilla, the de facto defense minister, told El Heraldo, a Honduran daily newspaper. He added cryptically, \u201cEverything can\u2019t be publicized because it would create anxiety.\u201d\nOne worry is that some members of the Honduran military loyal to Mr. Zelaya may have aided in his return. \u201cThere is a certain amount of concern among Hondurans about how Zelaya got into the country,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, editor of Americas Quarterly, a New York academic journal. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that he could get in without some cooperation from the military. And Micheletti, in particular, has to be worried about whether he really has control over all his forces.\u201d\nOne Venezuelan newspaper said Mr. Zelaya hid part of the time in a car trunk. Other accounts had him pulling up at the Brazilian Embassy in a vehicle with diplomatic plates that belonged to the Central American Parliament. Whether the Brazilians knew he was coming was a matter of debate.\nThe State Department official said the United States had been aware that Mr. Zelaya wanted to return to Honduras, because he had vowed to do exactly that during his last visit to Washington. But the official said the United States was caught unawares by Mr. Zelaya\u2019s appearance at the Brazilian Embassy, since he was expected in New York this week to address the United Nations.\nAfter tear gas was fired to disperse protesters and scores of curfew arrests were made Tuesday, the State Department official said the United States was deeply concerned about the de facto government\u2019s actions. He said he had heard reports that the security forces had taken control of houses surrounding the embassy, prompting the United States to send \u201cstrong signals\u201d to Mr. Micheletti that they expected the government \u201cto respect the inviolability of diplomatic territory and personnel.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/world/americas/23honduras.html", "title": "Mystery in Honduran Leader\u2019s Return", "author": "MARC LACEY and GINGER THOMPSON"}
{"date": "Tue, 06 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISTANBUL \u2014 Azerbaijan has begun to enforce a law that bans foreign companies from broadcasting on national frequencies, effectively closing its airwaves to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Voice of America and the BBC.\nForeign companies are still permitted to broadcast on shortwaves, satellite and cable, according to Ali M. Hasanov, an official in Azerbaijan\u2019s presidential administration.\n\u201cThey can broadcast any way they like, except for on our national FM frequency,\u201d Mr. Hasanov said by telephone from Baku, Azerbaijan\u2019s capital.\nBut Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL, an American-government-financed radio and television broadcaster with representation in most countries of the former Soviet Union, argues that FM was the primary way Azeris heard its programming, and that taking it away has cut off 90 percent of its audience.\nJeffrey Gedmin, president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, based in Prague, said that shortwave and Internet radio would not make up the difference, as Azeris had limited access to both, and said the change had left Azeris \u201cwithout access to free and independent media.\u201d\nThe law is several years old, but some aspects came into force at the end of 2008, which is when it began to affect foreign broadcasters, Mr. Hasanov said.\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty argues that the change had more to do with its critical stance than with legal reform, and says that shrinking access to news and pressure on the media is becoming commonplace throughout the countries of the former Soviet Union.\nKyrgyzstan took a weekly RFE/RL television show off the air last year, while Uzbekistan aired a documentary identifying its employees and giving their families\u2019 addresses, a risk in a country whose government harasses independent journalists and politicians. A teacher who had been a guest on a Turkmenistan public service program was harassed and briefly jailed last year, Mr. Gedmin said.\n\u201cThere is a trend against free media,\u201d Mr. Gedmin said in a phone interview from Prague. \u201cThey see us as a challenge to their authority.\u201d\nWhat began as a tool for the American government during the cold war, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has become an important source for news in many of the countries of the former Soviet Union since the collapse of Communism. Many leaders of former Soviet countries guard their power jealously, blocking independent news media and political opposition.\nRFE/RL has been one of the few surviving independent outlets, in part because of support lent to it by American embassies, which local governments do not want to offend.\nBut in Azerbaijan, even American government efforts to keep the programming on its FM station on air appear to have failed, and after weeks of negotiations, RFE/RL sent out a press release saying so on Dec. 30.\n\u201cThis is a move aimed at eliminating plurality,\u201d said Khadija Ismayilova, Baku bureau chief for Radio Azadliq, the name of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Azerbaijan. \u201cWe are the only place where the opposition has a chance to present their views, to take part in debates.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/world/europe/07azerbaijan.html", "title": "Azerbaijan Bars Foreigners From Use of Its FM Band", "author": "SABRINA TAVERNISE"}

They are accused of killing Staff Sgt. Simon Cullingworth and Sapper Luke Allsopp in the opening days of the Iraq war.\nBritish forces in southern Iraq arrested the two Iraqis in 2003 as former senior members of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Baath Party. British investigators later linked them to the killings, and the case was referred to the Iraqis for prosecution in late 2005.\nLawyers for the two suspects have fought against having them tried in their home country, arguing that they might be tortured and face the death penalty. But a British court ruled that the transfer was lawful.\nThe European Court of Human Rights then asked Britain to retain custody of the men in Iraq pending consideration of their appeal, but Mr. Hutton said Britain would lose the legal authority to hold them in the new year, when its United Nations mandate expired.\nPhil Shiner, a lawyer for the men, said the move was vindictive. \u201cThe relevant public servants dealing with this case appear to enjoy the prospect of my clients being hung,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/world/europe/01brit.html", "title": "British Defy Court on Iraqi Suspects", "author": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}

His enforcement arm, called the Fuerzas Armadas de Arturo, or the Armed Forces of Arturo, is considered one of Mexico\u2019s most ruthless, according to the State Department.\nSince September, he had been carrying out brutal retaliatory attacks against rivals, dumping decapitated heads and tortured bodies across two Mexican states, leaving notes from \u201cel jefe de jefes,\u201d the boss of bosses.\nBut on Wednesday, Mr. Beltr\u00e1n Leyva, one of Mexico\u2019s three most wanted drug kingpins, was killed during a battle with about 400 special forces troops from the navy and the army, who surrounded a complex in Cuernavaca, where he had an apartment.\nAnd although President Felipe Calder\u00f3n on Thursday called the operation \u201ca convincing blow\u201d against the drug cartels, his government also warned that drug-related violence might not abate and could even get worse.\nMr. Beltr\u00e1n Leyva, 48, who was also wanted in the United States, was the highest-level drug lord to be killed since Mr. Calder\u00f3n began his offensive against powerful drug gangs in 2006.\nSix other people suspected of being drug gunmen, included one who committed suicide, and one sailor died in the firefight, the Mexican authorities said.\nMr. Beltr\u00e1n Leyva\u2019s death is a public relations victory for Mr. Calder\u00f3n, who is facing criticism from the opposition over what they say is a lack of progress in his crackdown on drugs. Despite thousands of arrests and the capture of several gang leaders, drug violence keeps increasing.\nSpeaking from Copenhagen, where he is attending the United Nations climate talks, Mr. Calder\u00f3n called Mr. Beltr\u00e1n Leyva\u2019s death \u201ca convincing blow against one of the most dangerous criminal organizations in Mexico and on the continent.\u201d\nBut Attorney General Arturo Ch\u00e1vez Ch\u00e1vez said that violence would continue. \u201cGetting the leader of a cartel is a very strong blow and this will surely force restructuring,\u201d Mr. Ch\u00e1vez Ch\u00e1vez said. \u201cViolence inside the cartel can\u2019t be ruled out until the chain of command is defined.\u201d\nJorge Chabat, a security expert at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics, in Mexico City, said that Mr. Beltran Leyva\u2019s death was a step in the government\u2019s long-term strategy of fragmenting the cartels\u2019 power to limit their activity.\nBut not everyone agreed that the strategy was working.\n\u201cThe truth is that this is a type of thousand-headed hydra,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Pi\u00f1eiro, a researcher at the Autonomous Metropolitan University in Mexico City. \u201cYou cut off one and another one emerges, but the government believes that this tactic of dismembering cartels is effective.\u201d\nStill, the swift and effective operation on Wednesday sent a message, said Guillermo Zepeda, a security expert with the Cidac research group. \u201cBy getting the most visible leaders, you send the message that you are ending the impunity of the big capos,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that these surgical strikes are the ones that are really worth the trouble.\u201d\nMr. Beltr\u00e1n Leyva\u2019s organization had expanded its control over states in the central part of the country, including lucrative smuggling through the Mexico City airport, according to Mexican and American officials.\nMexican authorities have said that the gang bribed several senior antidrug agents.

{"date": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BERLIN \u2014 The politician everyone was talking about in the German capital the morning after national elections was not Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose party won the most votes, but the small-party kingmaker set to solidify the chancellor\u2019s hold on power. And soon, the rest of the world will become acquainted with the new leading figure, the Free Democrats\u2019 Guido Westerwelle.\nIf longstanding German tradition holds, Mr. Westerwelle will be named vice chancellor and foreign minister in the new government, his reward for steering his free-market, pro-business party to its best result yet in a federal election.\nThe role of statesman, with the prospect of mingling with the likes of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and France\u2019s foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, is one Mr. Westerwelle, 47, has spent the past several years preparing for. He has worked hard to transform his image from the fun-loving clown prince of politics, who once appeared on the German version of the reality show \u201cBig Brother,\u201d to that of a serious policy maker.\nTo judge by Sunday\u2019s election, the operation was a success. Mr. Westerwelle\u2019s Free Democrats emerged as the biggest winners of the day, watching their share of the vote rise by the largest amount of any party, to 14.6 percent, an increase of 4.7 percentage points over the previous election in 2005. The party rose even as Mrs. Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc lost ground slightly with voters, pulling in just a third of the vote.\nMr. Westerwelle met with Mrs. Merkel on Monday as part of negotiations to form the anticipated new center-right government, a partnership that the chancellor had told voters she needed in order to repair the country\u2019s economy. In a news conference, Mr. Westerwelle refused to discuss the division of top positions, including his own, saying, \u201cIt is about the right policies for our country and certainly not about these posts.\u201d\nHe went on to emphasize his \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with the chancellor. Indeed, Mr. Westerwelle, who is gay, came out in 2004 by bringing his partner to Mrs. Merkel\u2019s birthday party, while she was still in the opposition and the year before she became chancellor.\nMrs. Merkel said that she expected the negotiations to move quickly and that she wanted the new government in place no later than Nov. 9, the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, when heads of state from around the world are expected to visit for the commemoration. But just because the two parties want to govern together does not mean it will necessarily be easy to reconcile their proposals.\n\u201cMr. Westerwelle will strike a hard bargain when it comes to tax reform,\u201d said a prominent conservative legislator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the negotiations over forming the new government.\nThe Free Democrats\u2019 campaign platform called for more than $50 billion in tax cuts, more than twice what Mrs. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats promised. Yet, even the more modest figure could be hard to achieve without deep and unpopular reductions in social spending; deficits have soared as a result of the economic crisis and the government stimulus plan meant to combat its effects.\nFor many of the postwar years the Free Democrats were a swing vote in a Parliament dominated by the country\u2019s two major parties, the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats. But the Free Democrats were out of power for the last 11 years, a stretch in the opposition that allowed the party to sharpen its stands for lower taxes and against bureaucratic red tape.\nIt also gave Mr. Westerwelle, the youngest leader in the history of the party, time to grow up. Before the 2002 election he set his sights on winning 18 percent of the vote, and to drive home the point he wore a pair of shoes with \u201c18\u201d emblazoned in the party\u2019s trademark yellow on the soles. He also rode in a bright yellow bus he called the Guidomobile. The party fell far short of his target, earning itself just 7.4 percent of the vote and Mr. Westerwelle a reputation as a joker.\nMr. Westerwelle learned his lesson and cultivated a more serious image. His antics may have had a positive effect as well, broadening the party\u2019s appeal beyond its traditional base among business owners by attracting younger professionals.\nIn addition to emphasizing the party\u2019s trademark positions in favor of liberalizing the economy, Mr. Westerwelle also studied foreign policy, hoping to follow in the footsteps of Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a former party leader and current adviser whose two decades as foreign minister included German reunification.\n\u201cIn the past few years, he has clearly been preparing himself for this role,\u201d said Jan Techau, director of the Europe program at the German Council on Foreign Relations, where Mr. Westerwelle gave a lengthy foreign-policy address in May. But Mr. Techau described the appearance as cautious, emphasizing continuity in German foreign policy and reminiscent of the passive role for Germany favored by Mr. Westerwelle\u2019s mentor, Mr. Genscher.\n\u201cNot living up to the country\u2019s size and responsibility in the world is just not a sustainable foreign policy for Germany anymore,\u201d Mr. Techau said. Although the Free Democrats have supported Germany\u2019s participation in the NATO mission in Afghanistan, Mr. Westerwelle spoke out more strongly than Mrs. Merkel during the campaign about limiting the length of the deployment of the more than 4,000 German troops there.\nWhile talking about nuclear weapons at his news conference on Monday, Mr. Westerwelle referred to \u201crearmament\u201d when he clearly meant to say \u201cdisarmament,\u201d and shortly afterward apologized for his exhaustion after a long election night.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/world/europe/29germany.html", "title": "At German Chancellor\u2019s Side, a New Political Power Broker Emerges", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH and JUDY DEMPSEY"}
{"date": "Fri, 19 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Three ships and a nuclear-powered submarine are engaged in the most extensive marine search for black boxes from an airline accident in modern aviation history, air safety experts said Friday.\nSearch teams, with crew and equipment from the French and American navies, continued to scour the deep Atlantic waters on Friday, straining to hear an acoustic ping emitted from the flight data and cockpit recorders of Air France Flight 447, which crashed some 620 miles off the coast of northern Brazil in the early morning hours of June 1.\nVeteran investigators said they could not recall a similar effort to locate a plane\u2019s recorders; these could contain information that is critical to solving the mystery of the downed Airbus A330.\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any one event where there\u2019s been more than one military naval organization out there hunting for them,\u201d said Greg Feith, a former investigator at the National Transportation Safety Board.\nThe boats hunting for pings around the clock make up just part of the armada of sea and air craft involved in the search and recovery effort, which includes at least 11 ships, 10 planes and 2 helicopters from four countries. The Brazilian military has more than 1,000 personnel members devoted to the search.\nIt seems daunting and improbable to find tiny boxes in a huge ocean, especially with the precise crash site still uncertain, but searchers almost always recover them, air safety experts said.\nOf 20 airplane crashes in water over the past 30 years, in only one case was neither recorder found during the crash investigation, said Curt Lewis, the president of Curt Lewis & Associates, a safety and risk management consulting firm. In one other case, one of the two recorders was recovered, and in two cases he was not able to determine whether they were ever found, he said.\nBut this search is more difficult than most. French investigators are scouring an area with a 50-mile radius and water depths exceeding 15,000 feet. Most airliner crashes over water have been along coastal waters or along the continental shelf, said Paul Hayes, air safety director of Ascend, an aviation consulting company in London.\n\u201cThis is pushing the envelope,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of the depth of the water, this may be the accident where they fail to do it.\u201d\nSearchers are also pressed heavily for time. The boxes transmit signals for about 30 days before the signals start to fade. The batteries in the boxes on the Air France flight may have less than two weeks of life left before they go silent.\nAs the search for the boxes continued, Brazilian and French ships carried on with their recovery of bodies, debris and baggage. French authorities said Thursday that forensic teams were beginning the process of identifying the 50 bodies found so far.\nAir France said Friday that it would begin making initial payments of $24,000 each to compensate families of the 228 victims of the accident. Under the terms of the Montreal Convention, relatives of people killed in aviation accidents are entitled to up to $154,000 in damages.\nBrazilian medical authorities have begun autopsies of some of the crash victims. Some news reports have said that several of the bodies suffered fractures to their legs, hips and arms, leading some experts to suggest that the plane may have broken up in flight rather than when it struck the ocean.\nBut Paul-Louis Arslanian, the head of the French agency investigating the accident, BEA, said this week that it was still too early to draw definitive conclusions from the autopsies.\nFinding the flight recorders could go a long way toward clearing up such doubts. As the French submarine slithers through the waters, two Dutch ships, contracted to French investigators, are towing a pair of torpedo-shaped hydrophones, essentially underwater ears, listening in stereo to help determine the direction of the pinger signal.\nUnited States Navy personnel are assisting in the use of the hydrophones, which are attached by 23,000 feet of cable and on loan from the Navy, said Col. Willie Berges of the United States Air Force, chief of the United States military liaison office in Brazil.\nThe French ship is also equipped with equipment to listen for pings.\n\u201cWe have a grid, and the submarine has a grid, and everybody is looking for that noise,\u201d Colonel Berges said.\nOnce the ping is found, a French ship is set to send a robotic vehicle to the sea bottom to look for the recorders, he said. The French also have a minisubmarine with mechanical arms and a crew of three that can dive to 20,000 feet.\nThe Air France jet was equipped with memory chips, not tape, which are sealed in a hardened shell designed to protect them in crashes at sea.\n\u201cThe whole problem here is, you don\u2019t know where the crash site is,\u201d Colonel Berges said. \u201cWhere the debris is is not where the crash site is.\u201d\nStill, given previous successful efforts, investigators remain hopeful that the recorders can be retrieved, even in the often-jagged ocean bottom. Mr. Feith, formerly of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that if the pingers did not lead the searchers to the boxes, they might later find the wreckage with the boxes inside.\n\u201cYou have to hope the tail section stayed in a clump, rather than sling-shotting the boxes out somewhere,\u201d he said.\nIn previous sea crashes, searchers overcame improbable circumstances to recover the boxes. When an Air-India Boeing 747 was destroyed by a bomb off the coast of Ireland in 1985, searchers found the boxes in about two and a half weeks, in 6,700 feet of water.\nA Boeing 747 operated by Adam Air crashed in Indonesia in January 2007. Pingers were heard soon after, but recovery of the boxes took until August of that year because the water was more than 6,000 feet deep.\nThe case in which searchers failed to get either black box was that of a Boeing 727 owned by Faucett, a Peruvian airline, that crashed off Newfoundland in 1990, apparently because of lack of fuel, killing all 16 aboard.\nSome boxes take longer than others to find. Searchers used sonar to recover the cockpit voice recorder from a South African Airways Boeing 747 that crashed while traveling from Taiwan to Johannesburg in November 1987 \u2014 but not until 14 months later, and in 14,000 feet of water.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/world/20plane.html", "title": "Ocean Combed for Jet Data in Biggest Aviation Search", "author": "ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO and MATTHEW L.

A recent exodus of Peronist leaders, most notably Carlos Reutemann, a once-loyal senator from Santa Fe Province, has threatened the Kirchners\u2019 already tenuous grip on power.\nMrs. Kirchner has seen her popular support fall to under 40 percent in various job-approval surveys since a protracted battle with farmers over export taxes last year hurt the government\u2019s support in rural areas. And her decisions to nationalize the country\u2019s main airline and take over billions of dollars in private pension funds to offset falling commodity prices have driven away foreign investors.\nThose extra funds have given the government enough to pay more than $18 billion in foreign debts this year, economists said. But declining industrial production and falling exports because of the global economic crisis could make it tougher for the Kirchners later in the year, economists said.\nThe proposal could help secure a crucial victory for Mr. Kirchner, who is considering running for Congress himself in the important battleground province of Buenos Aires.\nA loss by the Kirchners\u2019 Peronist bloc in the congressional elections could force Mrs. Kirchner to resign, said Daniel Kerner, a Latin American analyst at Eurasia Group, a risk management consultancy in New York. \u201cThe government is obviously turning the election into a plebiscite on the Kirchners, as a means to force a resolution of existing political conflicts,\u201d he said.\nThe analysts also said the Kirchners might have been trying to undercut Mauricio Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, who has called for early citywide elections. Mr. Macri is widely viewed as a potential rival to Mrs. Kirchner in 2011.\nGraciela Romer, a political analyst in Buenos Aires, said the Kirchners were gambling that with the opposition fragmented and in disarray, their popular support would be sufficient to win the elections. Ms. Romer added that the effects of the economic crisis \u201ccan only hurt them if they wait until October.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/world/americas/14argentina.html", "title": "Citing Economy Worries, Argentine Leader Seeks Early Vote", "author": "ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO and VINOD SREEHARSHA"}

Asked if the number was likely to be around 1,000, Mr. La Russa said: \u201cYes, I\u2019d say so.\u201d\nAccording to the NATO command in Afghanistan, Italy has 2,750 soldiers currently serving in western Afghanistan. An increase of 1,000 soldiers would put the Italian deployment on a par with France.\nThe NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said Wednesday he believed members of the alliance would contribute 5,000 soldiers \u2014 and possibly more \u2014 to make a \u201csubstantial\u201d increase to the 42,000 NATO troops already ranged against the Taliban.\n\u201cThis is not just America\u2019s war,\u201d he said at the alliance\u2019s headquarters in Brussels.\nBut the president\u2019s entreaties drew an ambivalent response in some European nations where the war is broadly unpopular among voters who question why it is being fought and whether it can be won.\nFrance and Germany ruled out an immediate commitment, saying they were awaiting an Afghanistan conference in London in late January. Other nations offered only limited numbers of soldiers.\n\u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos, director of the European Union Institute for Security Studies in Paris, said the war was \u201cbadly perceived in Europe, contaminated by the Iraq war, the killing of civilians, the collateral damage, all of which has contributed to a widespread opposition to the Afghan war among Europeans.\u201d\n\u201cIf the civilian side is as important as the military one \u2014 training the Afghan police, judiciary and doing development, which Europeans know very well how to do and consider their main expertise \u2014 it will make it easier for European leaders to get support.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMore troops for a very unpopular war, without knowing where we\u2019re going, doesn\u2019t work \u2014 you can\u2019t sell it to Europeans,\u201d Mr. de Vasconcelos said. \u201cBut you can sell the transition from war to crisis management.\u201d\nMr. Obama\u2019s plan to send around 30,000 more American soldiers was closely watched in Pakistan, gripped by a Taliban insurgency intertwined with Afghanistan\u2019s.\nThere, distrust of American intentions runs deep, partly because the United States is seen as having abandoned the region after the Soviet Union\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, and there is widespread fear in the security establishment of a repetition of those events. And Pakistanis remain concerned about the possible implications of a huge troop surge just across their long and porous border with Afghanistan.\n\u201cPakistan looks forward to engaging closely with the United States in understanding the full import of the new strategy and to ensure that there would be no adverse fallout on Pakistan,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\nShireen Mazari, editor of an English-language Pakistani daily newspaper, The Nation, said the American surge was unlikely to bring success and would force Taliban insurgents into Pakistan. \u201cTheir policy is flawed, and it has to be changed. Playing the numbers game has to be stopped,\u201d she said.\nMehmood Shah, a former military official and a security analyst based in Peshawar, Pakistan, said: \u201cThe biggest apprehension is that our international borders will be crossed by the U.S. military. It can create a big dilemma for us.\u201d\nIn Europe, some analysts also said Mr. Obama\u2019s speech had fallen short of expectations.\n\u201cThis is one of Obama\u2019s most important foreign policy decisions,\u201d said Ayesha Khan, an analyst with Chatham House, a policy institute in London. \u201cIt comes after months of deliberation and a painstaking consultative process, but the outcome to this much-anticipated and long-awaited announcement has been an anticlimax for those who expected a paradigm shift.\u201d\nMr. Rasmussen, the NATO secretary general, did not say where he expected additional coalition forces to come from. Britain, the second-largest contributor after the United States, has promised to add 500 to its 9,000-strong Afghan deployment, and Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Wednesday that Britain would \u201ccontinue to play its full part in persuading other countries to offer troops to the Afghanistan campaign.\u201d\nPoland\u2019s defense minister said the country would increase its contingent by 600 from its current level of 2,000, to serve in combat, reconnaissance and training missions, The Associated Press reported, but the decision awaits governmental approval. A Spanish newspaper said Spain might increase its deployment by 200 soldiers to 1,200. Britain pledged to press other allies to boost their contingents in the patchwork of foreign troops in Afghanistan, known as the International Security Assistance Force.\nWith more than 2,800 soldiers on the ground \u2014 and a relatively high casualty rate among them \u2014 Canada welcomed Mr. Obama\u2019s decision, with Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon saying the \u201cadditional U.S. resources will help to provide a more secure environment for the Afghan people.\u201d\nThe French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, called Mr. Obama\u2019s speech on Tuesday night \u201ccourageous, determined and lucid, giving new impetus to the international commitment\u201d but he did not commit to adding to France\u2019s nearly 3,750 troops now in the war zone.\n\u201cFrance expects clear commitments from Afghan authorities, in answer to the strong commitments of the international community, on policy, economic and social development and on fighting drug trafficking,\u201d he said.\nThe foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said in a radio interview Wednesday that France had increased its force levels in September and, in its area of operations, \u201cour zone doesn\u2019t need a troop increase. Our area is well taken care of.\u201d\nBut he did not rule out further adjustment, referring to the international conference on Afghanistan in London in late January. \u201cWe will see how to adjust things then.\u201d\nGermany, too, is awaiting the gathering in London to decide whether to increase the size of its contingent. \u201cWe hear the wishes of the United States, but we will not decide in the coming days. We will decide only after the Afghanistan conference,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel said.\nSeveral German newspapers have reported that Washington is pressing for up to 2,500 more German soldiers. As the third-largest contributor in the alliance with 4,300 troops on the ground, Germany is currently debating a one-year renewal of a parliamentary mandate for the deployment which sets a maximum level of 4,500 troops.\nAn increase would need fresh parliamentary approval.\nIn a statement issued in Kabul on Wednesday Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said the president\u2019s review of Afghan strategy had \u201cprovided me with a clear military mission and the resources to accomplish our task.\u201d\nGeneral McChrystal had sought up to 40,000 American reinforcements in addition to the 68,000 already there.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/europe/04reax.html", "title": "Italy May Add 1,000 Extra Troops in Afghanistan", "author": "ALAN COWELL"}
{"date": "Thu, 05 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 Facing criticism from political foes and human rights advocates, the British government on Thursday defended a court\u2019s decision not to release information about a British terrorism suspect who says he was tortured in American custody. The court said it reached its decision because of what it called a threat from the United States to reconsider sharing intelligence with the country.\nIn a highly unusual criticism, the court on Wednesday expressed dismay that a democracy \u201cgoverned by the rule of law\u201d would seek to suppress evidence \u201crelevant to allegations of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, politically embarrassing though it might be.\u201d\nThe case has been a source of considerable diplomatic tension between the United States and Britain.\nAt issue in Wednesday\u2019s ruling were seven paragraphs that the court had redacted in an earlier opinion in the case, and that it suggested lent credence to the torture allegations by the suspect, Binyam Mohamed, who is now in prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. Mr. Mohamed is an Ethiopian who had become a legal resident of Britain. The case has rekindled concerns among some Britons about the claimed use of torture in terrorism cases.\nThe court said the paragraphs summarize reports by the United States to Britain\u2019s intelligence services about the treatment of Mr. Mohamed. It said it had removed the text at the request of the British Foreign Office, which was responding to a \u201cthreat\u201d from the Bush administration.\nThe court said the Bush administration had made the threat in a letter to the Foreign Office last September. It called on the Obama administration to reverse that position.\nIn Parliament on Thursday, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, David Miliband, denied that the United States had threatened to break off intelligence cooperation with Britain. But, he acknowledged, release of the documents against American wishes would cause \u201creal and significant damage to the national security and international relations of this country.\u201d\n\u201cThe issue at stake is not the content of the intelligence material but the principle at the heart of all intelligence relationships \u2014 that a country retains control of its intelligence information and it cannot be disclosed by foreign authorities without its consent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a principle we neglect at our peril.\u201d\n\u201cFor the record, the U.S. authorities did not threaten to \u2018break off\u2019 intelligence cooperation with the U.K.,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat the U.S. said, and it appears in the open public documents of this case, is that the disclosure of these documents by order of our courts would be \u2019likely to result in serious damage to U.S. national security and could harm existing intelligence information-sharing between our two governments,\u2019\u201d Mr. Miliband said. \u201cThat\u2019s a simple affirmation of the facts of intelligence cooperation.\u201d\nBut some opposition figures took issue with the government position. Ed Davey, a spokesman for the opposition Liberal Democrats, said Britain had \u201crolled over in the face of a barely credible threat from a friend\u201d and accused Mr. Miliband of standing \u201cin the way of allowing justice to take its course.\u201d William Hague, the foreign affairs spokesman of the larger opposition Conservatives, urged Mr. Miliband to press the Obama administration to change its approach. But Mr. Miliband rejected the suggestion.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the State Department said that the United States \u201cthanks the U.K. government for its continued commitment to protect sensitive national security information\u201d and that \u201cthe United States investigates allegations and claims of torture, and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment such as those raised by Binyam Mohamed.\u201d\nAfter being seized by American and British intelligence officials in Pakistan in 2002, Mr. Mohamed was taken to Morocco, where he was held for 18 months, according to earlier court rulings and American and British officials. The court said the summary was \u201chighly material\u201d to Mr. Mohamed\u2019s allegations \u201cthat he had been subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.\u201d\nActing on a request from the court last November, several news media organizations, including The New York Times, had asked the court to restore the redacted paragraphs.\nThe two-judge panel left no doubt that it thought the paragraphs should be in the public domain. There was nothing in them that would expose any intelligence agents, the court said.\nBut the judges said they had no legal authority to overrule the Foreign Office, which they said took seriously the \u201cgravity of threat\u201d by the United States to cut off intelligence sharing.\nMr. Mohamed, who had lived in the United States for several years as a teenager, went to Afghanistan in 2001. He said he had wanted to get off drugs. British and American officials have said he trained with Al Qaeda.\nAfter Mr. Mohamed was captured, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft said that he had been complicit with Jose Padilla to detonate a \u201cdirty bomb\u201d in the United States. Mr. Padilla was not charged with the plot, but was convicted on other terrorism-related charges by a federal court in 2007. Last year, the Justice Department said it was dropping the dirty-bomb charges against Mr. Mohamed, and last October all charges against him were dropped.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/world/europe/06britain.html", "title": "Britain Defends Court Ruling in Secrecy Case", "author": "RAYMOND BONNER"}
{"date": "Wed, 03 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As clergy members in Paris memorialized the 228 lives lost in the Air France crash, the navies of three nations covered thousands of miles on Wednesday in the search effort for the lost Airbus A330, with some success.\nThe Brazilian military said Wednesday that search teams had spotted four more debris clusters some 55 miles south of the wreckage that was discovered in the equatorial Atlantic on Tuesday, news services reported. The newly sighted debris included an unidentified metallic object 22 feet in diameter and a 12-mile-long oil slick.\n\u201cThe nature of the debris, the concentration of the debris ... all combines to prove that the debris from Air France 447 has been found,\u201d Christophe Prazuck, a French military spokesman in Brazil, said Wednesday, The Associated Press reported.\nThe main value of the debris may be as a clue to the location of more important parts of the plane that are certain to have sunk, notably the so-called black boxes, the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. Each is equipped with a device that sends out an audio beep that in favorable conditions can be heard at 5,000 meters \u2014 about 3.1 miles.\nBut the ocean is more than four miles down in some parts of the area, and, while water is an excellent transmitter of sound, the sound waves are reflected at boundary layers where the water changes temperature, according to Duncan W. Schofield, a principal engineer at Honeywell, which built the boxes. Searchers can lower microphones to listen, but those will be towed through the water at a speed of a few miles per hour, increasing the need to narrow the search area.\nFrench investigators have sent a ship with two remotely controlled submersible crafts that can be used to explore as deep as 19,600 feet. A United States Navy P-3C Orion surveillance plane, built to hunt submarines, joined the search Wednesday.\nA spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, Ted Lopatkiewicz, said his agency had worked with \u201ccivilian and military U.S. government agencies\u201d to look for radar or satellite data for the area at the time of the crash but had not found any. Unlike North Korea or the Middle East, the area does not have much security significance.\nAviation experts said the flight data recorder was designed to track more than 400 categories of data, including the strength of turbulence and the functioning of various cockpit systems. And the cockpit voice recorder, if recovered, would indicate who was in the cockpit.\nMore than four hours into the flight, the captain, who is required to be at the controls for takeoff and landing, would typically have gone off for dinner and a nap, according to airline experts, leaving a relief pilot and the first officer at the controls, both typically less experienced but well qualified for what is ordinarily a very quiet phase of flight.\nA Brazilian newspaper, O Estado de S. Paulo, reported Wednesday that an on-board automatic system had radioed back to Air France that the autopilot had disengaged, that the plane had switched to an alternative power source and that the systems that monitor speed, altitude and direction had also failed.\nThe plane was flying through an area of powerful thunderstorms, but there is no clear indication that the weather was unusual for the region. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything unusual about these storms,\u201d said Timothy A. Vasquez, a former Air Force meteorologist whose company, Weathergraphics, published a Web page showing the plane\u2019s path and satellite data of storm intensity at the time of the crash, on Monday a few minutes after midnight, local time. \u201cPlanes have flown through a lot worse; I\u2019ve seen worse squall lines in Kansas and Missouri,\u201d he said.\nThe plane was a so-called fly-by-wire model, meaning that a computer sits between the joysticks in the cockpit and the rudder, elevators and other controls. In older planes, the linkage is mechanical. But aviation experts suggested that while a lightning strike might damage or knock out some computers, it would be very difficult to knock out all of them and disable the controls.\nIn Paris, with the how of the crash still in the future, it was a moment about the what and the why. The service, at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in the center of the city, lasted more than an hour and was led by Cardinal Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois, the archbishop of Paris.\nOutside the cathedral and braving humid early-summer heat, a crowd of about 1,000 gathered to listen to the service on loudspeakers, watched over by scores of gendarmes and banks of TV cameras.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/world/europe/04plane.html", "title": "New Debris May Aid Search for Air France Data Boxes", "author": "MATTHEW L.

The judge overseeing the case, M. L. Tahilyani, said he would rule tomorrow. His decision could affect other cases pending in India and Pakistan.\nLawyers are also arguing about the way in which Mr. Kasab, who is supposed to have no access to newspapers or television, heard about the Pakistani government\u2019s admission that Pakistani citizens were involved in the attack. Mr. Kasab said Tuesday that guards outside his cell told him about the development, which prompted him to confess.\nThe prosecution asked the court to accept into the record a portion of Mr. Kasab\u2019s admission of guilt on Monday related to the killings at a busy Mumbai train station, where witnesses saw Mr. Kasab and an accomplice mow down dozens of people, but requested that it not admit other aspects of the confession that, it asserts, were filled with \u201clies and contradiction.\u201d\nThe prosecutor, Ujjwal Nikam, alleged that Mr. Kasab had deliberately played down his role in the attacks to avoid the death penalty and help his Pakistani counterparts who will be tried across the border. He said any evidence presented in court here could make its way to court there, an argument that Judge Tahilyani discounted.\nLater in the hallway, he told reporters that the case would now last for just one more month and that the prosecution would show why Mumbai and foreigners were targeted in the attacks. He also said he would expose the \u201cwhole infrastructure of the Lashkar-e-Taiba,\u201d the Pakistani extremist group that India and the United States say masterminded the attacks.\nBut Mr. Kasab\u2019s lawyer, S. G. Abbas Kazmi, said that his client had been \u201cmentally tortured\u201d by his guards, who told him that the case was now a lost cause for him since Pakistan had given him up and since the police, court and even defense lawyers were Indian. When the judge asked Mr. Kasab whether that was true, he said that this happened some time ago when he was in police custody, not recently.\nMr. Kazmi said the court should pursue one of two options: The judge can accept Mr. Kasab\u2019s plea and issue a judgment and sentence, or he can reject the admission of guilt and prohibit the incriminating statement Mr. Kasab made on Monday from being used during the rest of the trial.\nMr. Nikam complained that the defense lawyer was trying to mislead the court.\nMr. Kasab\u2019s admission has been the latest in a series of surprising incidents in the trial that have included the dismissal of a defense lawyer who had improper contact with a witness.\nThe Indian press has extensively covered the trial\u2019s every turn. Mr. Nikam and Mr. Kazmi have become familiar faces on television. They are mobbed by reporters every time they step out of the courtroom.\nThe judge declared part of Mr. Kasab\u2019s testimony on Tuesday, about his indoctrination as a militant, so explosive that he put it under seal.\nMr. Kasab seemed to almost invite a death sentence on Wednesday. \u201cWhatever I have done, I have done in this world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be better if I am punished in this world. It would be better than God\u2019s punishment.\u201d\nKavita Karkare, the wife of a senior antiterrorism police officer killed during the attacks, said she was relieved by Mr. Kasab\u2019s confession. \u201cWe should really hang him publicly,\u201d she told the NDTV news network. \u201cThat\u2019s what I feel.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/world/asia/23india.html", "title": "Mumbai Defendant Says He Would Accept Hanging", "author": "VIKAS BAJAJ"}

{"date": "Tue, 30 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Iraq celebrated the withdrawal of American troops from its cities with parades, fireworks and a national holiday on Tuesday as the prime minister trumpeted the country\u2019s sovereignty from American occupation to a wary public.\nEven with a deadly car bombing and other mayhem marring the day \u2014 the deadline for the American troop pullback under an agreement that took effect Jan. 1 \u2014 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki seized on the occasion to position himself as a proud leader of a country independent at last, looking ahead to the next milestone of parliamentary elections in January.\nHe made no mention of American troops in a nationally televised speech, even though nearly 130,000 remain in the country; most had already pulled back from Iraq\u2019s cities before Tuesday\u2019s deadline.\nThe excitement, however, has rung hollow for many Iraqis, who fear that their country\u2019s security forces are not ready to stand alone and who see the government\u2019s claims of independence as overblown.\nFrom Basra in the south to Mosul in the north, Iraqis expressed skepticism about the proclamation of \u201cindependence.\u201d\n\u201cThey will not withdraw to their homes; they will stay here and there so that they can return in emergencies,\u201d said Samir Alwan, 28, the owner of a mini-market in Basra. \u201cSo it is not sovereignty, according to my point of view, and I think that the Iraqi Army is only able to secure the south of the country and unable to secure Baghdad and Mosul.\u201d\nIn a national address, Mr. Maliki focused his praise on Iraqi troops and security forces for their role in fighting the insurgency. \u201cThe national united government succeeded in putting down the sectarian war that was threatening the unity and the sovereignty of Iraq,\u201d he said, as if the United States had played no role.\nPresident Obama, who ran for office on a pledge to end the war, marked the occasion with minimal fanfare, declaring it \u201can important milestone\u201d even as he warned of \u201cdifficult days ahead.\u201d\n\u201cThe Iraqi people are rightly treating this day as cause for celebration,\u201d he said.\nThe withdrawal did not command its own presidential appearance \u2014 Mr. Obama\u2019s brief remarks were delivered at a ceremony honoring entrepreneurs \u2014 a contrast with his predecessor, who rarely missed an opportunity to celebrate milestones in Iraq.\nUnderscoring the insecurity, a suicide bombing in a market in a Kurdish neighborhood of the volatile northern city of Kirkuk killed 33 people, according to the police there. In Baghdad, the American military reported that four United States soldiers were killed in an attack on Monday, evidence of the vulnerability of the troops as they withdraw.\nMilitary experts anticipate more violence in the days ahead.\nMr. Maliki\u2019s effort to capitalize on Iraq\u2019s latent anti-Americanism and to extol the abilities of his troops is a risky strategy. If it turns out that Iraqi troops cannot control the violence, Mr. Maliki will be vulnerable to criticism from rivals \u2014 not only if he has to ask the Americans to return but also if he fails to enforce security without them.\nSome American commanders have said they were taken aback by Mr. Maliki\u2019s insistence on taking credit for all the security successes in Iraq. However, they also see the importance of having him and Iraqi troops appear strong, especially in the face of insurgent factions intent on destabilizing the government.\nGen. Ray Odierno, the top commander of American troops in Iraq, brushed aside the dismissive tone of public remarks by the country\u2019s leaders about the Americans, saying that Mr. Maliki personally thanked him Monday night and again Tuesday for the sacrifices the American troops had made.\n\u201cI do not get these negative comments from the political leaders that are in the government,\u201d he said at a news conference at the American military headquarters at Camp Victory. \u201cIn my mind, I frankly don\u2019t worry about those comments because I understand that we are working this together.\u201d\nHe also played down concerns about security in Iraq\u2019s cities after the withdrawal of most American combat forces, noting that nearly 130,000 troops remained in Iraq. He said the American and Iraqi militaries continued to cooperate on security issues inside and outside the cities.\nIn most places the transition to the Iraqi forces has gone relatively smoothly, but there have been bumps, reminders of the underlying tensions between the two militaries and the resentment that American soldiers feel as the Iraqis appear eager to push them out the door even though they still want them to be on call.\nIn Diyala Province, where the Americans closed 11 of 18 bases or outposts before Tuesday\u2019s deadline, the transfers did not go entirely smoothly. An official in Mr. Maliki\u2019s office showed up early at a camp near Baquba and complained that the Americans had not left behind generators and air-conditioners for the Iraqis \u2014 something the American commander in the region said had never been part of the agreement. The dispute on Sunday delayed the formal transfer.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t treat your partners that way,\u201d the commander, Col. Burt K. Thompson of the First Stryker Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, said in Baquba.\nFor Iraqis, claiming sovereignty is something of a national pastime, with various politicians celebrating different markers: 2004, when the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority handed power to the interim Iraqi government; 2006, when Iraq seated its first constitutionally elected Parliament; and Jan. 1, when the security agreement took effect.\nMr. Maliki seems to be making a conscious effort to cement his image as a strong ruler by using many of the same tools of power as the predecessor he hated so much, Saddam Hussein. He has used the state television network and newspaper to spread nationalist messages, and has used parades and festivals to encourage public pride.\nOver the past several days the state television network, Al Iraqiya, not only ran a \u201cCountdown to Sovereignty\u201d clock but also broadcast promotional spots glorifying Iraqi history, culture and people. Its images of the marshes of southern Iraq, the markets of Baghdad, men performing traditional dances and children playing in the mountain meadows of Kurdistan \u2014 much of it filmed before the 2003 invasion \u2014 presented an image of Iraq completely unfamiliar to most Iraqis, who now live in neighborhoods cordoned off by blast walls and are forced to go through multiple checkpoints every day.\n\u201cThis is all for the media,\u201d said Amina al-Esadi, a female searcher at the compound of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, a religious Shiite political party.\n\u201cSome people are afraid because the Americans have left. Some think it will be better because then the enemies of the Americans will leave Iraq\u201d and the country will be safer, she said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/world/middleeast/01iraq.html", "title": "Iraq Marks Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Cities", "author": "ALISSA J.

{"date": "Mon, 10 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "Following is a transcript of the news conference held on Monday by President Obama, President Felipe Calder\u00f3n of Mexico, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in Guadalajara, Mexico, as released by the White House.\nPRESIDENT CALDER\u00d3N: (As translated.) Ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the media, national as well as international. The leaders from the United States, Canada and Mexico have completed two fruitful workdays for the benefit for our co-nationals. The leaders for North America share the vision and insight for the regional community that is safe, secure, and competitive, that can face successfully the challenges of the present and the future.\nWe coincide in pointing out that in an age marked by globalization, the challenges can only be overcome jointly -- thus the importance of keeping the dialogue, trust and cooperation amongst our three countries. Americans, Canadians, and Mexicans have reiterated that the values upon which our societies are founded are democracy, freedom, justice, and respect of human rights.\nOur three nations have reiterated our decision to combat in the struggle of the transnational organized crime in order to bring about more security to our communities. The struggles we have led in Mexico for the rule of law and the security of our Mexican people forces us to stop the traffic of weapons and of money that go from north to south that strengthen and nourish organized crime gangs. The notion of responsibility, co-responsibility, accountability, the exchange of information, and the building of our institutions should be the guidelines for our cooperation.\nIn this international crisis context, the three states that make up the North American region have to take the leadership and foster and boost the necessary measures to recover our economic growth. In our task we have had to implement countercyclical measures in the three countries that have been put into action. And in a coordinated manner we can stabilize our economies and bring about trustworthiness and certainty in regard to the future of the global economy.\nIt is also necessary to build our financial international institutions such as the World Fund, the International Monetary Fund, which are fundamental to guarantee the flow of the financial resources. In the case of Latin America, the support that will enable us to recapitalize the Inter-American Bank for Development will be the best action for help and commitment in regard to the poor countries in the region on behalf of the North American countries.\nI am certain that at the next G20 meeting that shall take place in Pittsburgh, United States, will be a great opportunity to build the necessary agreements to reform these organizations that are key in the recovery of our economies and our reprisal. I thank President Obama for fostering this meeting in Pittsburgh.\nAnd likewise, the United States, Mexico and Canada have tools to restart our agreements. We recognize that it is essential to abide by NAFTA and to resolve the pending topics that impede us to reach greater regional competitiveness. And it is important to see how we are going to fulfill our commitments in regard to the environment and in regard to our labor domains linked to the commercial agreements, the trade agreements we have amongst our countries. I am convinced that only in tapping the advantages offered by our economic complementary -- (inaudible) -- in terms of interest -- labor, technology, and natural resources -- we shall be successful in a world that is ferociously competing.\nAt this summit we have reached important agreements such as boosting the standardization of the regulations and certifications of our products, as well as the sanitary procedures and -- fight for sanitary procedures that can be simplified, as well as increasing without any losses, increasing the economic competitiveness of our region. The objective is to have secure and efficient conditions. These procedures to be implemented with no bureaucratic or far-fetched red tape in our offices. And this will diminish, decrease the prices for the staples and food, and improve the competitiveness of our economies.\nOn the other hand, on the bilateral aspect, Mexico and the United States will launch modernization initiatives at our common borders with determined terms in order to promote the regional competitiveness actions. And Mexico commends and is pleased to say that we're going to inaugurate the first international bridge that is currently being built after so many years between the United States and Mexico.\nThe United States, Mexico and Canada have coincided in the importance to face the repercussions of pragmatic change. The cost is very high but the price we shall pay for lack of action is not to be calculated -- cannot possibly be calculated. We coincide that we have to foster the global agreement in Copenhagen and the instrumentation for a green fund that will finance and support mitigation and adaptation actions in regard to the global -- (inaudible) -- of climatic change. We need to make progress in regard to clean energies and technologies as well as the development of our carbon market in order to have a regional market.\nNorth America has to be recognized as a responsible region and must set the example for the world in terms of environmental cooperation amongst countries with different levels of development.\nCooperation and solidarity amongst the North American region has to prevail at all moments, and thus it was demonstrated last April when our three countries faced the emergence of this new virus, H1N1. And working together, we showed our highest expressions of responsibility, accountability and transparency. And because we alerted timely the other regions in the hemisphere, they had the opportunity to implement preventive measures in order to abate the propagation of the virus and to avoid as far as possible its lethal repercussions.\nH1N1, as we know, will be back this winter. We are getting prepared, all three countries, to face in a responsible manner this contingency and abate its impact for our people.\nFirst Minister, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, at this summit the representatives of the United States, Canada, and Mexico have held an open and straightforward dialogue as countries that share values, that were to consolidate the right conditions for development and that have been able to found a successful society based on brotherly and responsible relationships. We believe in a North American region that is united, that is prosperous and wealthy, that is able to build a better future for the forthcoming generations.\nAnd I want to give the floor now to Mr. Stephen Harper, Prime Minister for Canada.\nPRIME MINISTER HARPER: (As translated.) Thank you, President Calder\u00f3n. Thank you to the Mexican people for their hospitality, for their warmth. And thank you to President Obama for your straightforward exchanges -- so positive on our priorities. These -- (inaudible) -- consisted mainly of the economy, health, and security in the North American region, and focused on energy, environment, and climate change in regard to the North American economy and the global economy.\nAnd thanks to the solid results in Canada with regard to financial regulations and fiscal actions -- have been very positive contribution. It's been important that since we are getting close to the G20 meeting, we have to underscore that countries have to go on with the reinforcement of their financial national/international institutions and to take the timely financial measures and to keep the markets open and to resist against protectionism.\nIn regard to the health domain and in regard to the influenza H1N1, it has been a threat, but the excellent cooperation amongst our three countries has helped to restrain the repercussions of this outbreak and we shall focus on that even more.\nIn regard to security, Canada recognizes the courageous commitment taken by President Calder\u00f3n to combat organized crime in Mexico. We commend him for his efforts and his actions have touched all of us.\nAnd we are still making the greatest efforts in Canada to find a pacific resolution for Honduras. We have to restate the democratic government and the rule of law in that country.\nIn regard to the energy and climate change, and since our economies are integrated, we have discussed about the importance of working together on a North American focus against climate change and in order to assure and guarantee a new international covenant that is efficient and truly global.\nAnd to finish, Canada, the United States and Mexico are good neighbors and good friends, too. As sovereign countries in a modern world, we are independent and interdependent both, and I can't wait to see you at the G20 and to welcome you at the summit in Canada for the Leaders of North America next year.\n(The Prime Minister repeats his remarks in English.) Thanks also to President Obama for candid and constructive exchanges on our priority issues. Those priority issues fitted into three broad categories: the economy; North American health and security; and energy, environment and climate change.\nOn the economy, because of Canada's strong record of financial regulation and fiscal management, we provided an informed voice at these meetings. As we approach the G20 summit in Pittsburgh, we continue to emphasize the countries must strengthen financial regulations and institutions, continue to implement timely economic stimulus, and maintain open markets to resist protectionism.\nOn North America health and security, we talked about our shared and effective response thus far to H1N1. It is a cross-border threat to all of us. The excellent cooperation among these -- our three countries was effectiveness in helping to manage the initial outbreak, and we will continue our cooperative efforts.\nOn security, Canada recognizes the courageous commitment of President Calder\u00f3n in taking on the drug traffickers. We are supporting these efforts, as it is a shared challenge for all of us in North America.\nAlso, on international peace and security, Canada supports ongoing OAS efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the political crisis in Honduras. We must restore both democratic governance and the rule of law.\nSorry, excuse me, I just about missed energy and climate change. Given the integrated nature of our economies, we did talk at some length about the importance of working together on a North American approach to climate change, and also on doing our best to ensure that out of Copenhagen and going forward we reach an effective and genuinely international new world protocol on greenhouse gas emissions.\nTo conclude, Canada, the United States and Mexico are good neighbors and also good friends. As sovereign countries in a modern world, we are both independent and interdependent. I'm looking forward to seeing both President Calder\u00f3n and President Obama at the G20; looking forward to hosting both of you next year at Canada's summit in our great country.\nThank you.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Good morning and buenos dias. I want to thank my great friend, President Calder\u00f3n, for his hospitality and for hosting us at this important summit, as well as my good friend, Prime Minister Stephen Harper. And I want to thank the people of Guadalajara and Mexico for the incredible warmth they've shown us on this, my second trip to Mexico as President.\nHere in Mexico, the word is \"juntos.\" And in Canada it's \"ensemble.\" But no matter how you say it, we come here today --three nations, one continent -- because of the challenges and opportunities that we will be facing together.\nLike our magnificent surroundings today, this city could not be a more fitting venue. Here in Guadalajara we see all the richness of Mexico's heritage -- its arts, its architecture, its vitality and its culture. And we also see all the possibilities of Mexico's future -- the innovation, high-tech industries and entrepreneurship that makes this one of our hemisphere's most dynamic cities.\nHere in Guadalajara we also see our continent coming together -- Mexicans, Canadians, Americans -- as tourists, as neighbors, educators and business partners; each bringing their unique traditions; each bound by mutual respect. Indeed, in the 21st century, North America is defined not simply by our borders, but by our bonds. And that is the spirit that defined the very productive summit that we had here today.\nFirst, we agreed that we had to work together to restore our common prosperity. The global recession has cost jobs and hurt families from Toronto to Toledo to Tijuana. So we renew our commitment to work together in Ottawa, Washington and Mexico City. Building on our progress at the G8 and G20 summits, we agreed to continue to take aggressive, coordinated action to restore economic growth and create jobs for our workers, including workers in the North American auto industry.\nBecause so much of our common prosperity and millions of jobs depend on trade that flows across our borders -- billions of dollars worth of trade every day -- we reaffirmed the need to reject protectionism. We recommitted ourselves to the infrastructure investments, the common-sense regulations and intellectual property protections upon which trade thrives. We are among each other's largest trading partners. As we work together towards lasting prosperity, we need to expand that trade, not restrict it.\nI would note that our common prosperity also depends on orderly, legal migration. All three of our nations have been enriched by our ties of family and community. I think of my own brother-in law who's Canadian. I think of the many Mexican Americans from Jalisco who found a home in Los Angeles and Texas and in my hometown of Chicago. At the same time, Americans, Mexicans and Canadians all expect their borders to be safe and secure. And that is why my administration will continue to work to fix America's broken immigration system in a way that is in keeping with our traditions of being both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\nAnd because our future prosperity also depends on clean energy economies, we built on our bilateral efforts to invest in renewable energy and green jobs, and we recommitted ourselves to the historic goals announced last month in Italy. Nations like the United States and Canada will take the lead by reducing emissions by 80 percent by 2050, and we will work with other nations to cut global emissions in half. Indeed, we made progress toward the concrete goals that will be negotiated at the Copenhagen climate change summit in December. And I again want to commend Mexico for its leadership in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and President Calder\u00f3n for his innovative proposals to help developing countries build clean, sustainable economies.\nSecond, we reiterated our abiding commitment to the common safety and security of our people. In response to the H1N1 pandemic, our three governments have worked closely, collaboratively and responsibly. With science as our guide, we resolved to continue taking all necessary preparations and precautions to prepare for the upcoming flu season and protect the health of our people. And this challenge transcends borders and so must our response.\nWe also resolved to continue confronting the urgent threat to our common security from the drug cartels that are causing so much violence and death in our countries. As I've said on many occasions, I heartily commend President Calder\u00f3n and his government for their determination and courage in taking on these cartels. And the President reaffirmed his government's commitment to transparency, accountability and human rights as they wage this difficult but necessary fight.\nThe United States will remain a full partner in this effort. We will work to make sure Mexico has the support it needs to dismantle and defeat the cartels. And the United States will also meet its responsibilities by continuing our efforts to reduce the demand for drugs and continuing to strengthening the security of our shared border -- not only to protect the American people, but to stem the illegal southbound flow of American guns and cash that helps fuel this extraordinary violence.\nThird, we reaffirmed our abiding commitment to our common values, including peace, democracy and human rights. And in particular, we discussed the coup in Honduras. As has been mentioned, our three nations stand united on this issue. President Zelaya remains the democratically elected president. For the sake of the Honduran people, democratic and constitutional order must be restored. And we will continue to work with others, especially the Organization of American States, to achieve a negotiated and peaceful solution.\nAnd finally, we pledged to continue all these efforts. I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Harper to Washington in September. I look forward to welcoming both my friends at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh, where I hope to reciprocate President Calder\u00f3n's hospitality.\nOur progress today is a reminder that no nation can meet the challenges of our time on our own. Our common aspirations can only be achieved if we work together. And that's what the nearly half-billion people in North America expect from us, so that's what we will do.\nThank you very much.\nPRESIDENT CALDER\u00d3N: (As translated.) Let's move on to the question-and-answer session. This will be one question per country, and we'll start off with Mexico.\nQ Good afternoon. President Obama, there are certain questions about violation of human rights here in Mexico and all these problems fighting drug trafficking. Are you going to certify Mexico? And how can we move forward with the Merida Initiative? We've also been concerned about any attempt against Felipe Calder\u00f3n's life. We know about certain threats and insecurity that prevails. This of course is certainly related to your country. We're concerned about the visa problem, too. What comments would you have regarding all these questions?\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: I didn't get a translation on that one. (Laughter.) So it sounded like a very good question. (Laughter.) Here, I think it's coming. Go ahead.\nQ We're concerned about the violation of human rights here in Mexico as we fight against drug trafficking. What are your concerns regarding this? And we'd also like to know if Mexico is going to be certified, and if you will help and apply resources for the Merida Initiative? We've also heard about some attempts against the life of President Felipe Hinojosa Calder\u00f3n. Do you have any knowledge of this? And we're also concerned about national security, we're concerned about visas, et cetera. We'd like to know, is there any possibility that you might turn this around, that we might not have any limit on visas?\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I'll just address the first two questions that seem to apply to the United States. Number one, we have been very supportive of the Merida Initiative and we will continue to be supportive. And we have already seen resources transferred, equipment transferred, in order to help President Calder\u00f3n in what is a very courageous effort to deal with a drug cartel -- set of drug cartels that are not only resulting in extraordinary violence to the people of Mexico, but are also undermining institutions like the police and the judiciary system that, unless stopped, will be very damaging to the country.\nNow, with respect to the conduct of this battle against the cartels, I have great confidence in President Calder\u00f3n's administration applying the law enforcement techniques that are necessary to curb the power of the cartels, but doing so in a way that's consistent with human rights. And we discussed this in our bilateral meeting and I am confident that as the national police are trained, as the coordination between the military and local police officials is improved, there is going to be increased transparency and accountability and that human rights will be observed.\nThe biggest, by far, violators of human rights right now are the cartels themselves that are kidnapping people and extorting people and encouraging corruption in these regions. That's what needs to be stopped. That's what President Calder\u00f3n is committed to doing, and that's what I'm committed to helping President Calder\u00f3n accomplish as long as he is President of Mexico.\nPRIME MINISTER HARPER: On the question of visas, it's important to understand the imposition of visa is due to one thing and one thing only, and that is the dramatic rise we have seen over the last few years, and this year in particular, in the number of bogus refugee claims being made from Mexico into Canada.\nIt's important to understand that this decision, first of all, has nothing to do with the actions of the Mexican government. The Mexican government has cooperated with us in efforts to stem this particular problem, to limit this particular problem. It continues to work with us in ways we might reverse it.\nBut the underlying problem, as I said to President Calder\u00f3n and others, the underlying program -- problem is in the Canadian refugee laws. It is simply far too easy in Canada to make a bogus refugee claim as a way of entering the country. And we have to change that. It is unfair to those who are legitimate refugees. It is also unfair to the hundreds of thousands of people who are working through our immigration system to become immigrants to this country -- to our country.\nSo as I say, we will continue to work with Mexican authorities to try and limit this problem. But in the absence of legislative change, it is very difficult for our governments to control this other than through the imposition of visa. It is the only tool available to us right now. So we need additional tools from our parliament to stem the flow of bogus refugee claimants and also to have additional tools to deal with this kind of problem.\nPRESIDENT CALDER\u00d3N: (As translated.) Let me address these three topics, which are very important to us. First of all, my government has absolute categorical commitment with human rights. The struggle, the battle, the fight against organized crime is precisely to preserve the human rights of the Mexican people -- right to safety; to security; to personal safety and integrity; and the right to have a safe family; the right to work without being really molested or disturbed -- the struggle for the security and safety of the Mexican people.\nObviously we have a strong commitment to protect human rights of everybody, the victims and even of the criminals themselves. And this is how it has been, this is how it will continue to be, and this is how the federal police will act, the attorney generals and armed forces will act. In all of these cases, there has been a very scrupulous effort to try to protect human rights in all cases.\nAnd anyone who says the contrary certainly would have to prove this -- any case, just one case, where the proper authority has not acted in a correct way, that the competent authorities have not punished anyone who has abused their authority, whether they be police officers, whether they be soldiers, or anyone else. We have a clear commitment with human rights. We have met this commitment, and we will continue to do so -- not because of any money that might come or come through the Merida Initiative or what's said in the Congress; because we have the strong commitment to human rights. And I certainly in a personal sense for several decades now, I have always had this commitment.\nI have some details about what you have pointed out, but in any case, it certainly won't be the first or the last occasion on which we might hear something about an attempt against my personal -- about my life, my person. But once again, the governments can't stop -- (inaudible) -- we know that we are destroying their criminal organizations. We're hitting them hard. We're hitting at the heart of their organizations. We're making them back away. And they know that we're not only taking an initiative in the struggle against crime, but we are actually being able to protect and defend our country better as time goes by.\nThis is not a type of vengeance of getting back at anyone, but we want to make sure that Mexico is a safe place to live in, that we will be able to move forward in this. We're not just talking about this organization, but whether our basic objective is to provide security, safety for the Mexican people. This is something that Mexican people are entitled to; that their families and their children can go out into the streets, they can go out to play, they can go to school, they can make progress and to fulfill their aspirations; that Mexico be a free country, free of delinquency, free of violence; that Mexico will be a safe country. And in the struggle we're not going to be intimidated, nor are they going to put a stop to our efforts.\nOnce again, I certainly hope that Mexico's society recognizes all of the efforts we're making along these lines -- the police force who have been victims of attempts and of cowardly acts by the criminals; all the efforts carried out by Mexican marines, by soldiers, and the different attorney generals, all of this, because we are committed to this ideal to have a safe Mexico, to have a safe country. And these are values that we believe in, and it's certainly stronger than any threat that could be made against us about any type whatsoever.\nSo once again, we have had dialogues with Prime Minister Harper on several different occasions as we did on this occasion at the summit on the matter of visas for Mexican visitors. We've talked openly, frankly, and certainly Mexico, certainly, feels very bad about this decision, about this rejection, even though, of course, it is a privilege of the Canadian government to stipulate this. But it certainly gets in the way of a good relationship, of what Prime Minister Harper and I are doing to have good relations between our two countries. And the explanations that Prime Harper has mentioned, there certainly is a problem with bogus refugee claim problem, and this has led to an abuse of the system.\nSo we're going to try to work together to collaborate together. We're doing this here in Mexico to try to do away with the underlying causes of this abuse regarding the general system for receiving refugees in Canada.\nOnce again, for me it's very clear that as the President of Mexico, that I certainly have the obligation of ensuring that a specific topic on the bilateral agenda not deter reaching our full potential of other matters on the agenda.\nAnd once again, here lies the great opportunity in this particular area of economic complementarities of the three countries' economies, and that this will take our whole region up to a higher state of competitiveness to the benefit of our people. These are the lines we've been working along, and I think we have been making great strides in this sense, and we certainly will continue to work along these lines in a frank and open way with Prime Minister Harper and President Obama.\nQ Let me preface this by saying we only get one question each, so I will proceed to be longwinded. (Laughter.) It's actually a two-parter. And the first part is a question for the three leaders, primarily President Obama. And I'd appreciate it --\nPRESIDENT CALDER\u00d3N: Could you use the microphone?\nQ And I would appreciate it if the Prime Minister, for the benefit of my Francophone colleagues, could answer in French, as well.\nThe \"Buy American\" caused considerable concern outside the United States. I am wondering what you discussed about \"Buy American\" at this meeting, and also what power you personally have to rescind this measure, and whether you intend to use that power.\nNow, on a not completely related topic, health care has been an issue of tremendous debate in your country, and Canadians have looked on with some fascination as our health care system has become a political football in your country. I'd like to ask Prime Minister Harper and President Obama whether there are elements of the Canadian health care system, particularly the public model, which are worth emulating.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, with respect to the \"Buy American\" provisions, I want to assure you that your Prime Minister raises this with me every time we see each other. So that's important to note, that he is expressing I think his country's concerns.\nI think it's also important to keep it in perspective that, in fact, we have not seen some sweeping steps toward protectionism. There was a very particular provision that was in our recovery package, our stimulus package. It did not extend beyond that. It was WTO-compliant. It was not something that I thought was necessary, but it was introduced at a time when we had a very severe economic situation and it was important for us to act quickly and not get bogged down in debates around this particular provision.\nPrime Minister Harper and I have discussed this and there may be mechanisms whereby states and local jurisdictions can work with the provinces to allow for cross-border procurement practices that expand the trading relationship. But I do think it's important to keep this in perspective. This in no way has endangered the billions of dollars of trade taking place between our two countries. It's not a general provision, but it was restricted to a very particular aspect of our recovery package.\nWith respect to the health care debate, we are having a vigorous debate in the United States and I think that's a healthy thing. The reason it's necessary is because we are on a currently unsustainable path. We spend far more per person on health care than any nation on Earth. Our outcomes in terms of various measures of well-being don't rank us at the top. We're not doing better than a lot of other advanced developed countries that are spending much less per person.\nIndividual families are being bankrupted because of the lack of insurance. We've got 46-47 million people without health insurance in our country. And for those who do have health insurance, they are always at risk of private insurers eliminating their insurance because of a preexisting condition or because they lose a job or they have changed jobs.\nSo the final aspect of it is, is that our health care inflation is going up so rapidly that our federal budget simply can't sustain it -- nor can businesses that are increasingly having to make decisions whether they hire more workers or eliminate health care; whether they stop providing coverage or they force more costs on to their workers. So the whole system is not working well.\nNow, how do we change it? When it's one-sixth of the U.S. economy, there are going to be a lot of opinions. And Congress has moved forward and we are closer to achieving a serious health reform package than we have been in the last 40 to 50 years. But there is going to continue to be a vigorous debate.\nI've said that the Canadian model works for Canada; it would not work for the United States -- in part simply because we've evolved differently. We have a employer-based system and a private-based health care system that stands side by side with Medicare and Medicaid and our Veterans Administration health care system. And so we've got to develop a uniquely American approach to this problem.\nThis, by the way, is a problem that all countries are going to have to deal with at some level because if medical inflation continues at the pace that it's going, everybody's budgets are going to be put under severe strain.\nAnd so what we're trying to do is make sure that we've got a sensible plan that provides coverage for everybody; that continues the role of the private marketplace, but provides people who don't have health insurance or have fallen through the cracks in the private marketplace a realistic and meaningful option. And we've got to do it in a way that also changes our delivery system so that we're not engaged in the kind of wasteful, inefficient medical spending that is so costly to us.\nSo I suspect that we're going to have continued vigorous debate. I suspect that you Canadians will continue to get dragged in by those who oppose reform, even though I've said nothing about Canadian health care reform. I don't find Canadians particularly scary, but I guess some of the opponents of reform think that they make a good boogeyman. I think that's a mistake. And I suspect that once we get into the fall and people look at the actual legislation that's being proposed, that more sensible and reasoned arguments will emerge, and we're going to get this passed.\nSorry to take so long on the question.\nPRIME MINISTER HARPER: (As translated.) With respect to your first question, yesterday we discussed this problem. I'm very happy to recently see that it's an agreement among the provinces and the federation to have a common front with respect to this problem. There have been a lot of discussions among American and Canadian ministers, ministers of trade, and also our public officials. These talks will continue once I meet again with President Obama over the next couple of months.\nWith respect to health care, the only thing I could say is the Canadians certainly support their own system, and the rest is really an American debate.\nAnd it's up to the provinces, for example, in Canada -- this whole thing about \"Buy American\", we had quite a bit of discussion on this, as President Obama has already mentioned, and I'm very glad to see that our provinces and the federal government have reached a recent agreement on this concern.\nAnd once again, all of the cross-border procurement process is interesting. I think when our trade ministers have gotten together -- the ministers are talking about this as well -- and President Obama and I will discuss this topic at future meetings.\nWith respect to the debate on health care in the United States, as you well know, we as Canadians support our own system, but with respect to the rest of the question this is up to United States and once again we do have certain jurisdiction in the provinces.\nGinger.\nQ To President Obama, given the fight that you're having to wage for health care, I wonder if you can tell us what you think the prospects are for immigration reform, for comprehensive immigration reform, which you've said is your goal; and whether you think that the blows you're taking now on health care and that the Democrats are likely to take around the midterm elections will make it hard, if not impossible, to achieve comprehensive immigration reform in this term -- and what you've told President Calder\u00f3n about that?\nPresident Calder\u00f3n, I'd like to hear a little bit about your thoughts on Honduras. There have been some in Latin America who have said that the United States has not acted strongly enough to return President Zelaya to power. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you feel about what the United States should be doing or could be doing to restore democratic order in Honduras.\nAnd, Prime Minister Harper, a few months ago the Homeland Security Secretary of the United States went to Canada -- or at least aggravated Canadian sensibilities when she compared the Canadian border to the Mexican border. And I wonder what you think about that and how you feel about the United States using some of the enforcement strategies adopted on the southern border in the north. Thank you.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: That's all? (Laughter.)\nQ That's all, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, Ginger, I don't know if you're doing some prognosticating about the outcome of the midterm elections, which are over a year away. I anticipate we'll do just fine. And I think when all is said on health care reform, the American people are going to be glad that we acted to change an unsustainable system so that more people have coverage, we're bending the cost curve, and we're getting insurance reforms so that people don't get dropped because of preexisting conditions or other issues.\nSo understand, though, I'm not acting based on short-term political calculations. I'm looking at what's best for the country long term. If I had been making short-term political calculations, I wouldn't be standing here as President, because nobody calculated that I could win the presidency.\nWith respect to immigration reform, I continue to believe that is also in the long-term interests of the United States. We have a broken immigration system. Nobody denies it. And if we continue on a path we're on, we will continue to have tensions with our Mexican neighbors; we will continue to have people crossing the borders in a way that is dangerous for them, unfair for those who are applying legally to immigrate; we're going to continue to have employers who are exploiting workers because they're not within a legal system, and so oftentimes are receiving less than minimum wage, or don't have overtime, or being abused in other fashion. That's going to depress U.S. wages. It's causing ongoing tensions inside the United States. It's not fair and it's not right, and we're going to change it.\nNow, I've got a lot on my plate, and it's very important for us to sequence these big initiatives in a way where they don't all just crash at the same time. And what we've said is in the fall when we come back, we're going to complete health care reform. We still have to act on energy legislation that has passed the House, but the Senate, I'm sure, is going to have its own ideas about how it wants to approach it. We still have financial regulatory reform that has to get done because we don't want a situation in which irresponsible actions in the global financial markets can precipitate another crisis. That's a pretty big stack of bills.\nFortunately, what we've been able to do is to begin meeting with both Democrats and Republicans from the House and the Senate. Secretary Napolitano is coordinating these discussions, and I would anticipate that before the year is out we will have draft legislation along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.\nNow, am I going to be able to snap my fingers and get this done? No. This is going to be difficult; it's going to require bipartisan cooperation. There are going to be demagogues out there who try to suggest that any form of pathway for legalization for those who are already in the United States is unacceptable. And those are fights that I'd have to have if my poll numbers are at 70 or if my poll numbers are at 40. That's just the nature of the U.S. immigration debate.\nBut ultimately, I think the American people want fairness. And we can create a system in which you have strong border security, we have an orderly process for people to come in, but we're also giving an opportunity for those who are already in the United States to be able to achieve a pathway to citizenship so that they don't have to live in the shadows, and their children and their grandchildren can have a full participation in the United States. So I'm confident we can get it done.\nOh, excuse me -- I know this wasn't directed at me, but I just want to make one quick point on Honduras, because you repeated something that I've heard before. The same critics who say that the United States has not intervened enough in Honduras are the same people who say that we're always intervening, and the Yankees need to get out of Latin America. You can't have it both ways.\nWe have been very clear in our belief that President Zelaya was removed from office illegally, that it was a coup, and that he should return. We have cooperated with all the international bodies in sending that message. Now, if these critics think that it's appropriate for us to suddenly act in ways that in every other context they consider inappropriate, then I think what that indicates is, is that maybe there's some hypocrisy involved in their approach to U.S.-Latin America relations that certainly is not going to guide my administration policies.\nPRESIDENT CALDER\u00d3N: (As translated.) Thank you. I will now make the most of this question. Now, in regard to migration, actually many of the people who work in the United States, who live in the shadow, live in the state or come from Jalisco, the state. These are people who have migrated in order to build a better future for their families. All of them, or most of them, have enormously contributed to the American society and the American economy, and it is unthinkable to see that the U.S., the main power, the main economic power in the world, without the contribution of the Mexican laborers and workers. This is not only a goodwill statement.\nAnd during our meeting, we handed the delegations the benefits of North America and what the Mexican population represents in terms of age in regards to the total population in the U.S. The only way to have sustained progress throughout the North American region, especially, is allowing for the natural economic processes, for integration can happen, and this implies a labor mobility that cannot be determined by mandate or by decree.\nThis is what we have underscored with President Obama during this meeting, to keep on invoking the protection for the Mexican laborers, whatever their migration conditions are in the United States. And our highest commendment to the way President Obama has tackled this migration issue now.\nNow, aside from defending the rights of the Mexican laborers in the United States, that one day instead of the Mexican people to have to leave their country because they're hungry or because they have to live their lives, we need an economic scheme where we have great investments coming from the U.S., hailing from Canada, and opening here the labor opportunities that the Mexicans so need.\nI think President Barack Obama has responded to the topic on -- or to the issue on Honduras -- what we have discussed and agreed as what needs to be done to build the international actions that have been taken in order to reestablish democracy in Honduras; to strengthen the OAS and the delegation that is about to meet in Tegucigalpa -- to build the mediation actions that Oscar Arias, President for Costa Rica and Peace Nobel Prize, is carrying out in order to reestablish the constitutional law in Honduras.\nThis is not about a person or another. This is not about President Zelaya himself, or per se. It is about the constitutional and democratic life that ought to be defended in regard to the international legal framework that we have all agreed upon.\nAnd once more, I coincide in the contradiction highlighted by President Obama -- those who have rejected or who have argued about the intervention of the United States in the region are those who now are claiming for the determination or the intervention of the U.S. in the region, no matter how legal this action might be.\nSo we have to resort to international law and international instances beyond the intervention of one single state -- or even more, the intervention of one single person -- to resolve such a dispute and such an issue. This is the path to be taken.\nToday we congratulate ourselves that President Obama is leading the administration of the United States. But in the past that happened, but in the future we don't know who might be President next. And I am not of those who share the idea that the U.S. elected as the ultimate judge. And the ultimate resolve is through the intermediation of the affairs in our countries.\nYes, we have to open the path to the OAS, to the international organizations, to the regional group that we have formed, such as the Rio Group, such as the groups that are friends of North America, the countries that befriend Honduras, that befriend Central America, that befriend Guatemala. These countries must act on our own accounts, but in observance of the international law and the rules we have settled ourselves. We have to form a group of friends of Honduras that through -- with the help of Oscar Arias and with the help of the OAS and their corresponding actiona.\nPRIME MINISTER HARPER: Just briefly, Minister Van Loan and Secretary Napolitano have been -- and our officials have been meeting regularly on management of our shared border. I think we have a good, cooperative relationship in that regard. There's obviously always work to be done.\nLet me be very clear: From the Canadian perspective, we look at our border as a line between the two closest countries on Earth. We have the largest trading relationship of any two countries on Earth, but we also share security concerns. I've said repeatedly, I say again, there is no such thing as a threat to the security of the United States which is not a threat to the security of Canada. That is why Canada has been a steadfast ally of the United States in NAFTA and NORAD for many, many years.\nWe want to address all the same security issues that the United States wants to address, and we want to do so in a way that doesn't impede commerce and doesn't impede the great social interaction which has made our two countries so close over the decades.\nI'm just going to also weigh in a little bit, as a friend of the United States, on a question that was posed to President Obama. If I were an American, I would be really fed up with this kind of hypocrisy -- you know, the United States is accused of meddling except when it's accused of not meddling, and the same types of -- same types who are demanding the United States to somehow intervene in Honduras, the same type of people who would condemn longstanding security cooperation between Colombia and the United States, which is being done for legitimate security and drug traffic reasons that is, frankly -- that are in the interests of all the countries of this hemisphere.\nMexico and Canada are involved in the mediation effort in supporting -- directly supporting the mediation effort of President Arias. I think the United States has been a -- very, very forcefully, articulated its concerns and its desired outcomes in that regard, and has been very supportive of those of us who are working in the multilateral process to deal with this serious issue in the hemisphere. So I think that's precisely what we want to see from the United States, is a United States that leads on issues of values, but is very supportive of multilateral attempts to deal with challenges that we all face.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you.\nPRESDIENT CALDER\u00d3N: Thank you. Gracias, todos.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/americas/11prexy.text.html", "title": "Text: News Conference in Guadalajara", "author": null}
{"date": "Fri, 13 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When he met President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia in April, President Obama sought to open an important new supply corridor for Afghanistan by flying American troops and weapons through Russian airspace. Visiting Moscow in July, he sealed a deal for as many as 4,500 flights a year, in what he called a \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d to the war and a sign of improving relations with Russia.\nSeven months after the idea was raised and four months after the agreement was signed, the number of American flights that have actually traversed Russian airspace?\nOne. And that was for show.\nThe failure so far to translate words into reality amid bureaucratic delays, including one involving a Russian agency insisting on charging air navigation fees that the Kremlin had said would be waived, underscores the challenges of Mr. Obama\u2019s effort to transform ties between Washington and Moscow. For all of the lofty sentiments expressed at high-profile summit meetings, actual change has never been easy to deliver.\nThe need to break through the logjam will soon take on fresh urgency if Mr. Obama decides to deploy tens of thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan. For eight years, the American military has struggled to find and maintain reliable supply routes into Afghanistan, but Mr. Obama may send more troops in a single order than at any point in the war, straining the system.\nBecause of the difficulties in getting supplies to Afghanistan through Pakistan, the new Russian air corridor \u201cwould be fairly important,\u201d said Ronald E. Neumann, a former ambassador to Afghanistan and now president of the American Academy of Diplomacy. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t answer the question of how much we\u2019ll be able to rely on the Russian connection, and that will be a big part of how much of a difference it can make.\u201d\nAnthony H. Cordesman, a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington who has advised Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander in Afghanistan, said the United States \u201cneeds as many options as it can get\u201d to send troops and equipment.\n\u201cThere is no way to predict how reliable any given route will be during a war that seems nearly certain to last for three to four more years,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to guarantee Pakistani stability, and almost any major base could be the subject of a large-scale Taliban bombing. The U.S. can live without a Russian option, but it would be much better off with one.\u201d\nThe uncertainty comes at a tenuous moment in Russian-American relations, as Mr. Obama seeks more support from the Kremlin in pressing Iran to scale back its nuclear program, and as the United States and Russia race to agree on a new nuclear arms treaty before the current one expires Dec. 5.\nThe problems with opening the air corridor as part of a so-called northern distribution network stem from a variety of technical issues that American officials are working to resolve, among them a dispute over who will pay. Under the pact that Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev sealed in July, the Russians agreed to waive air navigation fees typically charged for right of passage and air traffic control.\nAmerican officials said the new route would save $133 million a year in fuel, maintenance and other costs. But the Russian agency that collects the navigation fees has so far refused to exempt the Americans.\nThe Obama administration is sending a technical team to Moscow to try to work out what standards should apply to the flights, and spokesmen for the two governments played down the problem.\n\u201cWe are working through procedural delays on the Russian side and hope to begin regular flights soon,\u201d said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary.\nAleksei Pavlov, a spokesman for Mr. Medvedev, said the Kremlin had every intention of fulfilling the agreement. \u201cWe are eager to resolve this issue in the nearest future,\u201d he said.\nBut such seemingly minor complications have bollixed Russian-American agreements before. President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin agreed in 1998 to open a joint early warning center in Moscow, where Russian and American personnel would work side by side to detect missile launches and avoid misunderstandings that could lead to accidental war.\nTheir successors renewed the agreement, but the center has been delayed for 11 years amid disputes over issues like construction liability. Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev vowed to try again last summer, but in the latest holdup, the Russians have delayed allowing American inspectors into the country to examine the still unopened facility.\nThe idea of sending American forces through Russia to a war zone is fraught with a complicated history and mutual suspicion. For years, the idea was out of the question. Then in 2008, Russia agreed to open a land corridor, but only for nonlethal supplies.\nThe agreement to allow American troops and weapons to fly over the territory of Russia, its onetime cold war enemy, was seen as a symbolic breakthrough as much as a logistical one, and administration officials argued that it was a triumph even if no planes actually ever used the route. Still, just as some people in Moscow appear apprehensive about American forces in their airspace, some American officials are wary of putting too much faith in the Russians, who could easily close down the corridor if political tension rises again.\nThe latest transit agreement formally went into effect Sept. 4. A week later, the Pentagon sent Moscow a general description of cargo and personnel that would be shipped under the agreement, as well as the regular destinations of the planes, according to an administration official. The Russians accepted the request, and the two sides arranged for a single test flight on Oct. 8, just before Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Moscow.\nBut the dispute over the air transit fees has yet to be solved, complicated by whether the planes used will be American military craft or contracted civilian planes. Moreover, the American side is still working to amend its overflight agreements with Poland and Kazakhstan so the flights can traverse those countries as well.\nAdministration officials said that they remained confident these issues could be worked out, and that they had requested a second test flight to try to advance the program. They said that they did not expect Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev to talk about the issue when the presidents meet in Singapore on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, but that they hoped to resolve it at lower levels.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/world/europe/14flights.html", "title": "Russian Deal on Afghan Supply Route Not Done Yet", "author": "PETER BAKER"}

Despite budget cuts because of the plummeting price of oil, the program will sponsor 500 students this year, paying for them to study at American or British institutions on the condition that they return to Iraq and put their knowledge to work helping their native country.\nThe program is one of the first concrete examples of the kind of relationship that leaders in Iraq and the United States hope will emerge as America\u2019s military role transforms into a civilian one. \u201cThis is part of the peace dividend you could say,\u201d said Ambassador Adam J.

It will cost Iraq about $75,000 per student annually, according to Iraqi government officials.\nIf students do not return, they would have to reimburse the government for the cost of their education.\nMost of the students attending the two fairs had never been outside Iraq, but they believed that a degree from an institution in the United States, Britain or Australia would make them more marketable when they returned.\nThe initiative is the brainchild of a tenacious Iraqi-American, Zuhair Humadi, who moved to the United States as a young man in 1959 and returned to Iraq when the Americans toppled Saddam Hussein.

{"date": "Mon, 03 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BRUSSELS \u2014 On his first day on the job, NATO\u2019s new secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, called Monday for stronger European efforts in Afghanistan so that the United States did not feel alone in the fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda.\nCiting Qaeda attacks on European soil, Mr. Rasmussen said the battle against Islamic extremism belonged to Europe as well. \u201cI would urge Europeans to look closer into how to ensure a better balance in the alliance,\u201d he said in an interview here. \u201cTo that end we need increased European contributions.\u201d\nMr. Rasmussen, 56, a Danish former prime minister, takes office as European will to support NATO\u2019s biggest mission, the war in Afghanistan, is waning. NATO casualties there hit a record high last month, and Britain, France and Germany have shown a reluctance to commit more troops.\nBut echoing the plaintive pleas of his predecessor, the Dutch diplomat Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Mr. Rasmussen called for more European troops and more Europeans to train the Afghan Army and the police to stand on their own.\n\u201cIt is essential to keep this as a multilateral project, not least for political reasons,\u201d he said, alluding gently to the American-British invasion of Iraq in the face of major allied discontent. \u201cThat is a lesson I learned from the past. Even if America can do it on its own, there are heavy arguments for doing it through a multilateral approach within a NATO context.\u201d\nNATO has about 64,000 troops in Afghanistan, about half of them American. But the number of Americans is expected to increase to 68,000 by year\u2019s end, which would mean roughly two American soldiers for every non-American one.\nWashington would like at least some of the extra troops Europe has sent to Afghanistan to provide security for the coming elections to remain there, and to have more flexibility in their use, but Mr. Rasmussen refused to comment on the progress of that conversation.\nMr. Rasmussen, who was Denmark\u2019s prime minister for the last eight years, is the highest-ranking official to become NATO\u2019s secretary general. As prime minister, he was involved deeply in European Union and NATO issues. Having presided successfully over a contentious European Union during the fierce debate over expansion in 2002, he is respected by his peers and was the consensus pick of major European countries for this job.\nStill, it took the intervention of President Obama with Turkey to win consent for Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s appointment. When a newspaper printed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in 2005, setting off demonstrations and riots throughout much of the Muslim world, he defended freedom of the press in Denmark, saying he personally would not have printed the cartoons but rejecting a meeting with ambassadors from Muslim countries. He never apologized.\nTurkey argued that Mr. Rasmussen was an unfortunate choice as NATO was fighting a war against Muslims in Afghanistan. Asked about continuing skepticism about his appointment among Muslims, he said Monday that he had invited Muslim ambassadors \u201cto discuss with me how to develop a partnership with NATO\u201d and that he would go to Turkey on one of his first official visits.\n\u201cI consider it a part of the past,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen said of the cartoon controversy, \u201cand I think we should now focus on the future.\u201d\nHe insisted that strains with Turkey had been smoothed over and would not represent any extra difficulty as he tried to make the miserable Turkish-Greek relationship work inside NATO.\nAfter Afghanistan, NATO\u2019s biggest challenge may be Russia, with whom relations are deeply strained.\nMr. Rasmussen had little new to say on the subject, except that the relationship with Moscow was difficult and important for shared interests like fighting terrorism, nuclear proliferation and narcotics.\nNATO would insist that Russia \u201crespect its international obligations, including full respect for the borders of its neighbors,\u201d he said. NATO rejects any partition of Georgia, he said, and also would reject any special Russian \u201czone of privileged interest,\u201d as the prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, has declared, referring to former Soviet republics like Georgia.\nEach nation, Mr. Rasmussen said, has the right to choose its alliances. But NATO is in no hurry to bring Ukraine or Georgia into the alliance in the face of fierce Russian opposition and meddling. And while Russia has not pulled its troops out of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which it promised to do, NATO is clearly not going to do much about it.\nMr. Rasmussen, who is fluent in English and French (he owns a summer house in France), said he welcomed France\u2019s reintegration into the military alliance.\n\u201cThe French decision has removed a lot of suspicion internally\u201d within NATO, he said. \u201cIt opens big and interesting perspectives for trans-Atlantic relations and the NATO-E.U. relationship, in a much more relaxed and less ideological way than we had before. Don\u2019t underestimate what happened in Europe.\n\u201cThe U.S. and Canada will see quite a new attitude from the European side,\u201d especially on questions of NATO\u2019s assuming further roles outside its traditional European region, he said.\nMr. Rasmussen also said he would work to find a solution to the conflict over the name for the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, which Greece insists must not call itself simply Macedonia, which is also the name of a Greek region. Condoleezza Rice, when she was the American secretary of state, joked at a NATO conference that the new name should be the Republic of Aardvark, so it would come first at the table. Mr. Rasmussen would not be drawn out on that suggestion, although he smiled broadly.\nHis first priority, he said, will have to be Afghanistan. Despite anxiety about the mission, there will be no artificial deadlines for pulling out, he said, and NATO \u201cwill support the Afghan people for as long as it takes.\u201d\nBut what is it to \u201cprevail\u201d in Afghanistan?\n\u201cMy criterion of success is that we can hand over gradual responsibility for security to the Afghans themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Afghans must be masters in their own house; that\u2019s the longer-term goal.\u201d\nAfghan War Commanders Meet\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a sign of the priority now given to the Afghan mission, the American defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, flew without public announcement to Belgium on Sunday for private consultations with the top commanders for the war effort.\nIn the strategy session were Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of American forces in Afghanistan and Iraq; Adm. James G. Stavridis, NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander; Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander in Afghanistan; and his deputy, Lt. Gen. David M. Rodriguez.\nThe meeting at Chi\u00e8vres Air Base \u201cwas an opportunity for the secretary to get an interim report on General McChrystal\u2019s assessment of the security situation in Afghanistan\u201d and to discuss the situation with senior commanders and advisers, said Geoff Morrell, a Pentagon spokesman.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/world/04nato.html", "title": "NATO Chief Urges Bigger European Role in Afghan War", "author": "STEVEN ERLANGER"}

The move represented an escalation of the opposition\u2019s tactics, and it indicated that its leaders were now trying to put economic pressure on Mr. Saakashvili after failing to remove him with protests.\nPolice officers did not try to restrain the demonstrators at the railroad station. Mr. Saakashvili was widely criticized by his allies in the West after his government carried out a violent crackdown on an opposition protest in 2007. Since the current opposition campaign began on April 9, he has ordered law enforcement personnel to avoid confrontations.\nThere have been some spurts of minor violence surrounding the protests, but no widespread arrests. The security services have mounted undercover operations that they say show that opposition leaders have sought weapons to fight the government.\nThe Tbilisi railroad station is an important artery for passenger and freight traffic, and a lengthy shutdown could have significant repercussions.\n\u201cBecause the government doesn\u2019t want to make the right decision to settle the political crisis, we have to take radical actions,\u201d said Nino Burdzhanadze, a former Parliament speaker and an ally of Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s who later broke with him.\nMs. Burdzhanadze indicated that the opposition might allow passenger trains to depart, but not those carrying freight. Some opposition leaders later said they might also try to seize Tbilisi International Airport.\nMr. Saakashvili has regularly called for dialogue with the opposition, but its leaders have said they will cease demonstrations only if he steps down. He met once with opposition leaders this month, but the sides could not agree on even minor issues.\nMr. Saakashvili came to power after leading the so-called Rose Revolution in 2003, which ousted a government with ties to the Soviet Union. Since then, his opponents have accused him of becoming increasingly autocratic, and they fault him for pushing Georgia last August into the disastrous war with Russia.\nMr. Saakashvili has insisted that he will serve out his term, which ends in 2013.

Their imams were being murdered. Their tolerant beliefs were under withering attack.\nSo the moderate Sufi scholars recently did what so many other men have chosen to do in anarchic Somalia: they picked up guns and entered the killing business, in this case to fight back against the Shabab, one of the most fearsome extremist Muslim groups in Africa.\n\u201cClan wars, political wars, we were always careful to stay out of those,\u201d said Sheik Omar Mohamed Farah, a Sufi leader. \u201cBut this time, it was religious.\u201d\nIn the past few months, a new axis of conflict has opened up in Somalia, an essentially governmentless nation ripped apart by rival clans since 1991. Now, in a definitive shift, fighters from different clans are forming alliances and battling one another along religious lines, with deeply devout men on both sides charging into firefights with checkered head scarves, assault rifles and dusty Korans.\nIt is an Islamist versus Islamist war, and the Sufi scholars are part of a broader moderate Islamist movement that Western nations are counting on to repel Somalia\u2019s increasingly powerful extremists. Whether Somalia becomes a terrorist incubator and a genuine regional threat \u2014 which is already beginning to happen, with hundreds of heavily armed foreign jihadists flocking here to fight for the Shabab \u2014 or whether this country finally steadies itself and ends the years of hunger, misery and bloodshed may hinge on who wins these battles in the next few months.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on terra incognito,\u201d said Rashid Abdi, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit group that tries to prevent deadly conflicts. \u201cBefore, everything was clan. Now we are beginning to see the contours of an ideological, sectarian war in Somalia for the first time, and that scares me.\u201d\nFor two years, Islamist insurgents waged a fierce war against Somalia\u2019s transitional government and the thousands of Ethiopian troops protecting it. In January, the insurgents seemed to get what they wanted: the Ethiopians pulled out; an unpopular president walked away; and moderate Islamists took the helm of the internationally recognized transitional government of Somalia, raising hopes for peace.\nBut since then, the verdict on the moderates has been mixed. In the past two weeks, the Shabab have routed government forces in Mogadishu, the capital. The tiny bit of the city the government controls is shrinking, block by block, and Ethiopian troops have once again crossed the border and are standing by. As many as 150 people have been killed, and the relentless mortar fire has spawned streams of shellshocked civilians trudging into the arid countryside, where they face the worst drought in a decade.\nIf Mogadishu falls, Somalia will be dragged deeper into the violent morass that the United Nations, the United States and other Western countries have tried hard to stanch, and the country will fragment even further into warring factions, with radical Islamists probably on top.\nBut out here, on the wind-whipped plains of Somalia\u2019s central region, it is a different story. The moderates are holding their own, and the newly minted Sufi militia is about the only local group to go toe-to-toe with the Shabab and win.\nThe several-hundred-square-mile patch of central Somalia that the Sufis control is not nearly as strategic as Mogadishu. But the Sufis have achieved what the transitional government has not: grass-roots support, which explains how they were able to move so quickly from a bunch of men who had never squeezed a trigger before \u2014 a rarity in Somalia \u2014 into a cohesive fighting force backed by local clans.\nMany Somalis say that the Sufi version of Islam, which stresses tolerance, mysticism and a personal relationship with God, is more congruent with their traditions than the Wahhabi Islam espoused by the Shabab, which calls for strict separation of the sexes and harsh punishments like amputations and stonings.\n\u201cWe see the Sufis as part of us,\u201d said Elmi Hersi Arab, an elder in the battered central Somalia town of Dusa Marreb. \u201cThey grew up here.\u201d\nThe Sufis also tapped into an anti-Shabab backlash. The Shabab, who recruit from all clans, and, according to American officials, are linked to Al Qaeda, controlled Dusa Marreb for the better part of last year. Residents described that period as a reign of terror, with the Shabab assassinating more than a dozen village elders and even beheading two women selling tea.\n\u201cWe respected the Shabab for helping drive out the Ethiopians,\u201d said one woman in Dusa Marreb who asked not to be identified for safety reasons. \u201cBut when the Ethiopians left and the Shabab kept the war going, that to us didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nThe Sufis, a loosely organized, religious brotherhood, also drawing from many different clans, had studiously avoided getting gummed up in Somalia\u2019s back-and-forth clan battles, often no more than thin cover for power struggles between businessmen and warlords. But in November, Sheik Omar said, the Shabab shot dead several Sufi students. The next month, the Shabab tore apart Sufi shrines.\nA spike of panic shot through the Sufi schools, where young men like Siyad Mohammed Ali were studying Islamic philosophy. \u201cWe had never told the Shabab how to worship,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now we were under attack.\u201d\nMen like Mr. Siyad became the backbone of the new Sufi militia, which got a crate of AK-47s from one set of clan elders or a sputtering armored truck from another. In December, the Sufis, whose organization is called Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama, which roughly translates as the followers of the Prophet Muhammad, drove the Shabab out of Dusa Marreb. Since then, the Sufis have defended their territory several times against Shabab incursions.\nHassan Sheik Mohamud, the dean of a college in Mogadishu, said the rise of the Sufis was \u201cabsolutely, totally new historically.\u201d\n\u201cThey had a reputation for being peaceful,\u201d he said.\nThe Sufis are loosely allied to the transitional government, which has promised to rule Somalia with some form of Islamic law. The president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, is a bit of an enigma, coming from a long line of Sufi clerics, yet rising to power in 2006 as part of an Islamist alliance with a decidedly Wahhabi bent. He has said that he wants women to play an important role in government, but several prominent Somali women said that during a recent meeting, he would not look them in the eye.\nMany Somalis say that Sheik Sharif is making the same mistake his predecessors made, spending more time riding around foreign capitals in a Mercedes than working Mogadishu\u2019s streets to cultivate local allies.\nOut here, the Sufis are moving ahead with their own small administration, meeting with United Nations officials and running patrols. At night, in a circle under a tree, they rest their AK-47s on their Korans, drop their foreheads to the earth and pray.\n\u201cWe have jihad, too,\u201d said Sheik Omar, a tall man with a long beard and warm eyes. \u201cBut it\u2019s inner jihad, a struggle to be pure.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/world/africa/24somalia.html", "title": "For Somalia, Chaos Breeds Religious War", "author": "JEFFREY GETTLEMAN"}
{"date": "Wed, 24 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 A bomb attached to a motorcycle exploded in the Sadr City section of Baghdad, killing at least 76 people and injuring 156 in a market as it was filled with shoppers, hospital officials said Thursday.\nThe bombing Wednesday evening was at least the third in two weeks to cause double-digit casualties in Shiite communities. On Saturday, a truck bomb in Taza, a Shiite Turkmen area in northern Iraq, killed at least 68 people. On June 10, a car bomb exploded outside Nasiriya, the capital of a predominantly Shiite province in southern Iraq where bombs are rare, killing at least 28 people and inciting a near riot among survivors who threw stones at the police, blaming them for lax security.\nThe bombing occurred just six days before the American forces officially withdraw from Iraqi cities, towns and villages, as required under the Iraqi-American security agreement. In Baghdad, many of the troops have already withdrawn, and whatever preventive effect they had may well be fast evaporating. In their absence, insurgent groups appear to be beginning to test the security system now run almost wholly by Iraqis.\nIn 2005, similar attacks on Shiite neighborhoods eventually prompted Shiites to form their own militias to help protect themselves, setting off a cycle of sectarian violence. The recent bombings have not resulted in reprisals, but in Iraq it is always difficult to tell when the tipping point may come.\nSearching for someone to blame, witnesses and relatives of the wounded placed responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s bombing on the Iraqi Army, the Iraqi government, the American military and Iraqi political parties.\nPoliticians from the movement affiliated with the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr accused the 11th Brigade of the Iraqi Army, which is responsible for Sadr City, saying that it was behind the attack and that the American military was, in effect, a co-conspirator because it had brought the brigade to the poor, sprawling neighborhood.\n\u201cHow come the Muraidi Market that is surrounded by blast walls and no vehicle or motorcycle can go inside but they allowed in this motorcycle?\u201d said Ahmed al-Masoudi, a member of Parliament and a spokesman for the Sadr bloc. \u201cThe 11th Brigade is directly involved in these crimes, these murders.\n\u201cWe are astonished and speechless in the face of this huge, this enormous explosion,\u201d he added. \u201cThis crime is driven by hatred. Those people who have been killed are not sheep; they are families and human beings.\u201d\nA number of political observers here say they now believe that the attacks are intended to discredit Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. He has taken credit for improving security, but the stance carries considerable political risk when violence breaks out.\nThe presence of the American military has also been a significant factor in the nation\u2019s stability, along with the active participation of the largely Sunni neighborhood watch groups, known as the Awakening. But now the American military is stepping back and the Sunni guards, many of them former insurgents, are watching the government with skepticism, uncertain whether they have a political voice. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Maliki will be able to keep violence to an acceptable level.\n\u201cAll this is against al-Maliki,\u201d said Muayad Hamed, a doctor who has watched the politics of Shiite neighborhoods because he has worked on projects in Sadr City and other Shiite communities in Baghdad. \u201cThe rumor on the street is that after 30 June there will be more attacks to show that al-Maliki cannot work without the Americans and that all his power came from the Americans,\u201d he said.\nThe scene on Wednesday evening at Imam Ali hospital, the largest in Sadr City, was one of mourning and chaos. Relatives and friends of the victims jammed the doors, pushing and shoving as they pleaded with hospital employees to let them search for loved ones. Many of those who had managed to enter received only sad news. Women wailed in grief as they discovered that their sons or husbands had been killed.\nOne, Um Ali, blamed the government. \u201cWhere are the promises of the government; they said we are going to do things better,\u201d she said as she waited to see her sons, both of whom had been badly wounded. \u201cLook at what they\u2019ve done. They have done nothing for us. It just goes from worse to worse.\u201d\nOthers accused the people they thought had carried out the attacks. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t fear God did this, the terrorists,\u201d said Ali Abbas, near tears as he stood next to one of his brothers, who was badly wounded. He said he believed that another brother had also been hurt in the attack.\nHaider Kadhim, 34, who had a badly injured leg, spoke in a low tone as if he could not believe what happened. \u201cMe and my friend went to the market because there was no electricity at home and it was too hot,\u201d he said, \u201cso we went out and were just hanging out, and now I\u2019ve lost my friend.

{"date": "Thu, 05 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The United Nations mission in Afghanistan announced plans on Thursday to relocate hundreds of foreign staff members, sending some out of the country, in the wake of a lethal attack on its workers at a guesthouse last week.\nThe relocation of its workers here, while temporary, is one more signal of mounting pressure on United Nations operations as security deteriorates around the region. The move comes four days after the United Nations announced that it was withdrawing its international workers from northwestern Pakistan, where insurgents are fighting Pakistani troops and have carried out a string of attacks.\nIn recent weeks, United Nations workers on both sides of the border have been singled out in deadly attacks, in what appears to be a deliberate campaign by insurgents to undercut international support for the embattled Afghan and Pakistani governments.\nFive United Nations workers for the World Food Program were killed in a suicide attack at the program\u2019s offices in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, in early October. Last week in Kabul three insurgents dressed in police uniforms scaled the front gate of a guesthouse where United Nations staff members were staying to mount a terrifying two-hour siege.\nFive of the United Nations\u2019 staff members were killed, along with two Afghan security officials and the brother-in-law of a prominent Afghan politician, before the attackers were shot and killed. The strike was the biggest on the United Nations in Afghanistan in its half-century of work here and forced the organization to lock down its operations as it reviewed security nationwide.\nA United Nations spokesman, Adrian Edwards, said Thursday that about 600 international staff members would be temporarily relocated either to other places in Afghanistan or outside the country, primarily Dubai and Central Asian countries.\nThe hope is that they will be able to return within three weeks to a month, but it could take longer to set up secure housing, Mr. Edwards said. He said the mission was reviewing all its locations.\nBut he stressed that the United Nations was not reducing its presence in Afghanistan. The United Nations has at least 1,000 international staff members assigned to Afghanistan, and at any time 600 to 700 of them are in the country. The number of Afghan staff members is much bigger, around 4,500, Mr. Edwards said.\nEven as their work has grown increasingly risky, United Nations officials have come under criticism for their handling of Afghanistan\u2019s fraud-plagued presidential election. President Hamid Karzai was declared the victor this week after his challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, decided not to participate in a runoff, saying he had no confidence that it would be fair.\nAt a news conference on Thursday, Kai Eide, the United Nations special representative to Afghanistan, took a stern line toward the government, warning Mr. Karzai that unless he carried out sweeping reforms of his government, he would be at risk of losing the support of the international community.\nMr. Eide said it was important that Mr. Karzai review election oversight procedures and investigate the involvement of government officials in facilitating the fraud. He also encouraged him to increase the competency of his cabinet.\nMany of the Kabul government\u2019s outside backers, including the Obama administration, have urged Mr. Karzai to do much the same, but it was the first time the United Nations mission had publicly done so.\n\u201cI do believe it\u2019s understood that serious reforms are needed, and I believe that reforms will come as a new government is formed,\u201d Mr. Eide said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to compose his government,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have seen new competent ministers coming in, and it has had an impact.\u201d\nHe added later: \u201cWhat we have said to President Karzai is, \u2018You have some competent people, and you need more of them.\u2019 \u201d\nElsewhere in the country, an American soldier was killed Wednesday by insurgents while on patrol in eastern Afghanistan, the NATO mission said.\nIn western Afghanistan, NATO forces were investigating reports of civilian casualties in an airstrike on Wednesday in Helmand Province near the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah.\nCapt. Jane Campbell of the Navy said that NATO forces fired a single surface-to-surface rocket at a place near the village of Babaji, in the Lashkar Gah district, against a group of nine people believed to be placing an explosive device. There were conflicting reports from local residents about whether the strike killed civilians or insurgents.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/world/asia/06kabul.html", "title": "U.N.

Five others were injured.\nNATO officials in Kandahar ruled out insurgent fire as a factor, as the helicopter was well within the perimeter of the military base, crashing just after it took off more than a mile inside the camp, said Capt. Glen Parent of the Canadian Army. \u201cIt was taking off, but for some reason the takeoff was not successful,\u201d said Captain Parent, a spokesman for NATO forces. \u201cWe can confirm 100 percent that it was not due to insurgent fire.\u201d\nThe helicopter was a Russian Mi-8 owned by a Russian company, Vertical-T Air, the Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported, citing the Russian aviation agency. The agency said 15 people had been killed.\nIt was not clear why the Russian agency\u2019s and NATO\u2019s casualty figures differed. The victims\u2019 nationalities were not identified.\nIt was the second deadly crash of a civilian transport helicopter in southern Afghanistan in recent days. Last week, six Ukrainians were killed when a Russian-made, Moldovan-owned helicopter that had been contracted to work for NATO forces crashed in Helmand Province. Moldovan authorities said it was brought down by insurgent fire.\nCivilian contract helicopters are commonly used to ferry contractors and supplies from major bases to far-flung NATO and American military outposts across Afghanistan.\nIn addition to the crash in Kandahar, a United States Army helicopter crash-landed Sunday near a military base in Kunar Province in eastern Afghanistan. There were injuries but no fatalities, according to military officials, who said the crash was not caused by insurgent fire.\nOn Saturday, a United States F-15E fighter jet crashed in central Afghanistan, killing both crew members. The military said \u201chostile fire\u201d was not a factor.\nPentagon officials also identified the captured United States soldier who was shown in an Internet video released Saturday by his Taliban captors.\nMilitary officials have said the soldier, Pfc. Bowe R. Bergdahl, 23, of Ketchum, Idaho, walked off his outpost in eastern Afghanistan three weeks ago. In the video, the soldier says he was captured after he lagged behind during a patrol. Afghan police officials said the soldier\u2019s base was in Paktika Province, a rugged and dangerous region that borders Pakistan.\nThe Pentagon said Private Bergdahl was a member of the First Battalion of the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, part of the Fourth Brigade Combat Team of the 25th Infantry Division based at Fort Richardson, Alaska.\nBob Bergdahl, the soldier\u2019s father, from Hailey, Idaho, issued a statement on Saturday, saying, \u201cWe hope and pray for our son\u2019s safe return to his comrades and then to our family, and we appreciate all the support and expressions of sympathy shown to us.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/world/asia/20afghan.html", "title": "16 Killed in Copter Crash at Afghan Base", "author": "RICHARD A.

{"date": "Tue, 17 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PARIS \u2014 Armed gunmen came ashore in Equatorial Guinea on Tuesday morning and headed for the presidential palace before being repelled, the government said.\nThe government said the contingent of \u201crebel terrorists\u201d had come by motorboat from nearby Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta, where seaborne raiding parties have grown increasingly bold in recent years, launching raids against banks and other targets in neighboring countries.\nBut the main militant group in Nigeria\u2019s southern Niger Delta said Tuesday that its fighters were not involved in the early morning attack on Equatorial Guinea\u2019s capital, Malabo.\nIn a statement to Reuters, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, said: \u201cWe heard of the incident but MEND is not involved at all. The people are paranoid.\u201d\nFor Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony that has been repeatedly rattled by coups and coup attempts, Tuesday morning seemed to begin with an all-too familiar refrain. For a few hours, according to residents, news reports and officials, the steamy capital rattled to the sound of gunfire that was \u201csometimes sporadic, occasionally intensive,\u201d as one resident put it.\nThe intruders got as far as the presidential compound, the resident said, speaking in return for anonymity. A government statement said at least one of the attackers was shot to death and others died when the Equatorial Guinea navy sank their boat.\nAmong some residents there was a whisper that mercenaries might be involved. Others, including the government, said the gunmen were more likely to be militants from the Niger Delta who attack from the sea in wooden boats.\n\u201cA contingent of rebel terrorists from the Delta arrived in numerous boats and tried to invade the capital, with the aim of taking and destroying the presidential palace,\u201d a government statement said, suggesting that the invaders\u2019 intention was, indeed, to attack the government.\n\u201cAfter an exchange of fire, the rebels were repelled by the armed forces and state security forces,\u201d the statement said.\nDuring the attack, which began before dawn, residents said a helicopter gunship took to the air in support of government forces. Automatic weapons fire rattled around the island capital for about 90 minutes after the shooting began. Government troops deployed and threw up roadblocks. Banks and stores were closed.\nSince 1979, Guinea has been ruled by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who took power by overthrowing his uncle in a coup and has acquired notoriety as a repressive ruler. The president was not in the palace during the attack, the Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear to have been an attempted coup,\u201d a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Madrid, speaking under customary rules of anonymity. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know right now whether these were just ordinary criminals or if it was politically motivated.\u201d\nFor some outsiders, the episode recalled Equatorial Guinea\u2019s history as both the inspiration of books about coups \u2014 including Frederick Forsyth\u2019s \u201cThe Dogs of War\u201d in 1974 \u2014 and as a potential theater for real attempts, such as a failed coup in 2004 organized by British upper-crusters. One of them, old Etonian Simon Mann, was convicted there in July 2008 of trying to overthrow the government. He was sentenced to 34 years in jail.\nIn more recent years, the tiny nation, roughly the size of Maryland with around half a million residents, has drawn in investors and others attracted to riches reflecting Equatorial Guinea\u2019s wealth as the third-biggest crude oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa.\nIt was that wealth, too, that persuaded British conspirators in 2004 to use a mercenary force to try to overthrow the president, hoping to making a lot of money.\nThe plotters in 2004, however, never got to Equatorial Guinea\u2019s shore. Mr. Mann, a former member of British special forces, was arrested in Zimbabwe when a plane carrying a mercenary force of 80 soldiers was seized during a halt supposedly to pick up weapons.\nMr. Mann served three years in prison in Zimbabwe after being convicted of an arms violation but was then rearrested and extradited to Equatorial Guinea, which ordered that he be brought to trial.\nThe case ultimately ensnared a motley cast of upper-class Britons, including Sir Mark Thatcher, the son of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was arrested by the South African police for helping to finance the plot and pleaded guilty to avoid jail time, though he insisted that he was an unwitting participant.\nThe coup attempt evoked an African era when European soldiers of fortune sought to meddle in the affairs of the continent, sometimes helping dictators stay in power, sometimes engineering their downfall \u2014 all depending on who paid for their services, and how much.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/world/africa/18guinea.html", "title": "Gunfire Rattles Capital of Equatorial Guinea", "author": "ALAN COWELL"}

{"date": "Tue, 24 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 American missile strikes have reduced Al Qaeda\u2019s global reach but heightened the threat to Pakistan as the group disperses its cells here and fights to maintain its sanctuaries, Pakistani intelligence officials said.\nThe officials acknowledge that the strikes and raids by the Pakistani military are proving effective, having killed as many as 80 Qaeda fighters in the past year. But they express growing alarm that the drone strikes in particular are having an increasingly destabilizing effect on their country.\nThey also voiced fears that the expected arrival of 17,000 American troops in Afghanistan this spring and summer would add to the stresses by pushing more Taliban fighters into Pakistan.\nThe assessment was provided during a two-hour briefing by senior analysts and officials of Pakistan\u2019s main spy service, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with the agency\u2019s policy.\nThe analysis reflected the increasing public pressure on the Pakistani government to oppose the drone attacks, which are deeply unpopular here for the civilian casualties they have inflicted.\nBut it also underscored ominous signs of Al Qaeda\u2019s resilience and pointed to new and unintended dangers for American policy in the region \u2014 a rapidly destabilized, nuclear-armed Pakistan, a state with a weak civilian government and a military struggling to fight an expanding insurgency.\nThe sobering Pakistani assessment was in contrast to the optimism voiced earlier this month by the new American director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair.\nWhile the Pakistani analysis agreed with Mr. Blair\u2019s conclusion that Al Qaeda\u2019s ability to conduct large-scale attacks against the United States was most likely degraded, it also signaled no cessation to the attacks by Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban aimed at undermining Pakistan\u2019s government.\nThe Pakistani officials suggested that Al Qaeda was replenishing killed fighters and midlevel leaders with less experienced but more hard-core militants, who are considered more dangerous because they have fewer allegiances to local Pakistani tribes.\nAl Qaeda was using sophisticated Web sites and sleeper cells across the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia to enlist young fighters who were less patient or inclined to plan and carry out far-reaching global attacks and who had instead redirected their energies on more immediate targets and on fomenting insurgency in Pakistan, the officials said.\nQaeda leaders have also increased their financing and logistical support for the Taliban and other militant groups, having come to see the survival of Qaeda sanctuaries as dependent on the ability of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan to hold territory.\n\u201cIt\u2019s morphing into a monster and growing uglier,\u201d said one senior Pakistani intelligence official.\nThe chief of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, has indicated that the impact on Pakistan of more American troops in Afghanistan will be among the most important topics at his meetings in Washington this week, Pakistani officials say.\nPakistani intelligence and military officials say there is no argument that Qaeda fighters must be hunted down; they provide targeting information to the C.I.A., which remotely pilots the drones. But they complain that the missile strikes cause too many civilian casualties and that they hand the militants a propaganda windfall.\nAmerican officials defended the strikes, although they acknowledge that the attacks alone will not rout Al Qaeda and the Taliban from the safe havens.\n\u201cAl-Qaeda and its allies are resilient,\u201d said a United States counterterrorism official. \"But there\u2019s real value in keeping them off balance in the tribal areas. They come to doubt their security, their hosts, even each other.\"\nPakistan says it has captured some 630 Qaeda fighters and senior leaders since 2001. But the assessment underscored the difficulties still faced by Pakistan\u2019s security forces; in that time, nearly 1,600 of its troops were killed and more than 3,700 were wounded.\nThe Pakistani intelligence assessment found that Al Qaeda had adapted to the blows to its command structure by shifting \u201cto conduct decentralized operations under small but well-organized regional groups\u201d within Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nAmerican counterterrorism officials have long complained that Pakistan protects some militant groups like the Taliban as a proxy force, a charge that Pakistani officials say is no longer true.\nAmerican officials say the longstanding ties are coming back to haunt Pakistan.\n\u201cIn Pakistan, the jihadist Frankenstein monster that was created by the Pakistani Army and the Pakistani intelligence service is now increasingly turning on its creators,\u201d Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst, said in an interview on the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Web site on Jan. 28, two weeks before he was named a chairman of President Obama\u2019s strategic review of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nThere are other signs that Al Qaeda is under stress but adapting. Al Qaeda has given up training sites and shifted to mobile training teams, which Pakistani intelligence officials say are still effective.\nThey often consist of just a few bomb-making or tactical experts schooling a handful of fighters in a private house, according to a mid-level ISI agent who works in the tribal belt.\nThe flow of new recruits comes largely from countries like Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Somalia and Uzbekistan, Pakistani intelligence officials said. They often travel through Iran, enter Pakistan through Baluchistan Province and then move onto Waziristan for training, the agent said.\nThe impact of the new Qaeda emphasis on operations inside Pakistan was on full view in Swat, an area about 100 miles north of the capital, Islamabad, where the Pakistani Army agreed to a truce last week with the Pakistani Taliban, who control 70 percent of the territory, the agent said.\nUzbeks affiliated with Al Qaeda carried out the brunt of the militants\u2019 operations against civilians and the army in Swat, the agent and Pakistani military analysts said. The Uzbeks, who were driven across the border from Afghanistan with the Taliban and Qaeda after 2001, have been particularly ruthless as they helped their allies secure sanctuary in the tribal areas.\nThey have now been unleashed on Pakistani soldiers in Swat, the agent said.\nIn addition, Maulana Fazlullah, the leader of the Taliban in Swat, was backed by about a half-dozen Arab fighters from Al Qaeda who served as the \u201cmain motivators,\u201d the agent said.\nThe Arabs who traveled from the Qaeda bases in Waziristan across the tribal belt to Swat are held in high esteem by Pakistani Taliban fighters, the agent said. \u201cThe Arabs motivate the local guys, who see them as people who have forsaken all their money for jihad,\u201d the agent said.\nThe missile attacks by the American drones that have killed senior Qaeda figures had disrupted the lives of militants in North and South Waziristan, according to a fighter who goes by the name of Abdullah and who was interviewed in Peshawar, the capital of the North-West Frontier Province.\n\u201cWe now often sleep in the river beds or under the eucalyptus trees,\u201d he said, adding that people were constantly on alert for the sound of the aircraft.\nThere was little doubt that the killing of Usama al-Kini, a Qaeda operative who was the senior commander for operations inside Pakistan, represented a setback to morale and operations, the fighter said. \u201cHe was very popular and very sociable with the ordinary people,\u201d the fighter said.\nMr. Kini, a Kenyan, was killed in January near Wana, the capital of South Waziristan. He was described by Pakistani law enforcement officials as the mastermind of the terrorist attack against the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad last year.\nBut the Arab leaders of Al Qaeda were intent on promoting their fighters up through the ranks to overcome the loss of leaders like Mr. Kini, the fighter said.\n\u201cThe Arabs have a strategy to elevate people to a higher position,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone is killed there is always a replacement.

{"date": "Tue, 03 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BUKIMA, Congo \u2014 Jean-Marie Serundori\u2019s eyes light up when he sees his old hulk of a friend Kabirizi.\nWar, displacement and bloodthirsty rebels had gotten between them.\nBut for the first time in years, this section of a venerated Congolese national park is rebel-free. Government wildlife rangers, like Mr. Serundori, are firmly in control \u2014 for the moment. And Kabirizi, a 500-pound silverback gorilla with a head as big as an engine block, seems to be flourishing in his kingdom of leaves.\n\u201cHaa mmm,\u201d Mr. Serundori says, emitting a special gruntlike gorilla greeting that miraculously stops Kabirizi in midcharge. \u201cHaa mmm.\u201d\nIf the endangered mountain gorillas are any sign, things may finally be looking up in eastern Congo. In the past several weeks, Congo and its disproportionately mighty neighbor, Rwanda, have teamed up to sweep this area clear of rebels who had been at the center of a vicious proxy battle between the nations.\nThe enmity of Congo and Rwanda has been one of the most stubborn drivers of the bloodshed here, which has claimed millions of lives in the past decade. But if these two countries continue to cooperate, it could represent a significant step toward ending one of Africa\u2019s most vexing wars.\n\u201cThis is really good news, that there\u2019s a serious improvement in relations,\u201d said Koen Vlassenroot, a professor at Ghent University in Belgium who specializes in eastern Congo. \u201cBut it\u2019s still rather confusing.\u201d\nMr. Vlassenroot and other Congo hands are warning that all the years of cross-border meddling and intrigue as thick as the Congolese jungle make it extremely difficult to tell whether the new Rwanda-Congo relationship is a genuine and lasting change, or simply more maneuvering.\nThe joint military operation has been somewhat successful, at least by eastern Congo\u2019s depressingly low standards. The two former enemy armies fought side by side without massacring each other. They killed dozens of rebels, including some commanders, and exerted pressure on several hundred to leave the bush. They arrested Laurent Nkunda, the Congolese rebel leader and former general whose brutal tactics and Congo-size ambitions had threatened to plunge this entire region back into war.\nBut at least 100 villagers were killed, too, either in the cross-fire or by fleeing rebels bent on revenge. And there may be more bloodletting to come.\nOver the past several years, most of Congo has wearily climbed out of war. Large tracts of the country, despite all the headlines, are peaceful. But it is these very hills along the Congo-Rwanda border that have remained a lush green killing field, with Rwanda supporting one rebel force and Congo supporting another.\nThe ensuing violence has sucked up so many of Congo\u2019s political and military resources that the so-called wild, wild east has been like an intractable weight around the entire country\u2019s neck.\nToday, the hills are quiet, which has allowed the wildlife rangers back into Virunga National Park, home to 200 of the last 700 or so mountain gorillas on the planet. Thousands of villagers around the park have trudged home from displaced persons camps, another vote of tentative confidence.\n\u201cBusiness is picking up,\u201d said Bahati Banyele, who fixes radios in a little town called Kibumba, which had emptied out during last fall\u2019s fighting.\nNobody is celebrating yet.\nPeople here remember all too well the Sun City peace treaty reached in South Africa in 2002, which was supposed to rein in marauding militias but did not.\nThey recall the democratic elections in 2006, which cost more than $500 million and raised hopes but did not end the war.\nAnd they remember the countless cease-fires and conferences at fancy hotels that spelled more fighting even before the delegates jetted home.\nOne of the biggest points of uncertainty right now is Congo\u2019s president, Joseph Kabila, who has gone out on a limb by inviting in the Rwandans, in the hope that this could break the deadlock between the countries.\nSeveral former allies of Mr. Kabila among top lawmakers in Kinshasa, Congo\u2019s capital, are now denouncing him as a traitor. They are demanding investigations.\nIndeed, his precarious toehold on power could slip further if the Rwandan government, as many people here suspect, has not truly severed ties to the rebels.\nThe presence of Rwandan troops in eastern Congo makes a lot of Congolese nervous. The little country next door invaded Congo twice, in 1996 and 1998, ostensibly to secure its own borders, though human rights groups have accused Rwandan troops of plundering Congo\u2019s rich trove of minerals and massacring civilians.\nMr. Serundori, the wildlife ranger, who is 50, said Rwanda-backed troops killed his wife in 1997. She was mentally ill and did not flee town when the troops stormed in.\nHis life, like so many others around here, has been circumscribed by conflict. He started working as a wildlife ranger in 1989, when Congo was dysfunctional, famously corrupt but relatively stable.\n\u201cThere were so many tourists who wanted to see the gorillas,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you had to wait a whole week.\u201d\nBut in 1994, all that changed. More than a million refugees from Rwanda\u2019s genocide poured into eastern Congo, which promptly exploded from many of the same tensions over ethnicity and land that tore Rwanda apart. The Congolese war dragged in a half-dozen other African countries, eager to settle their own scores and cart off Congo\u2019s tin, timber, diamonds and gold.\nThe gorilla park became a battlefield. And a poacher\u2019s paradise. Armed groups used their automatic weapons on hippos, chimps, gazelles, elephants and the gorillas.\nSome of the rangers have been implicated in various criminal activities, most recently involving charcoal, which is illegally made from the rapidly disappearing hardwood trees in the park.\nMr. Serundori says he was never tempted, although his salary is only $35 a month.\n\u201cMy culture is to respect the forest,\u201d he said. He has even called the gorillas his \u201ccousins.\u201d\nThis past October, the fighting peaked. The Rwanda-backed rebels led by Mr. Nkunda smashed government troops and stormed army bases and the rangers\u2019 headquarters. Mr. Serundori and hundreds of other rangers were instantly homeless. In November, he was stuck with his 10 children in a camp of plastic sheeting where cockroaches nibbled on his dwindling pile of food.\nBut after Mr. Nkunda\u2019s surprise arrest in January, many of the rebels agreed to join government forces. The only sign these days of the once formidable rebel army in Virunga National Park is a trail of tin cans.\nA new battle is raging in the jungle, though. The Kabirizi gorilla family has been trying to fight back the advances of the Humba gorilla family, and sometimes you can hear the screeches and hoots from miles away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s over the usual stuff,\u201d Mr. Serundori explained. \u201cTerritory and females.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/africa/04congo.html", "title": "In Congo, With Rebels Now at Bay, Calm Erupts", "author": "JEFFREY GETTLEMAN"}
{"date": "Sat, 17 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "THE car\u2019s engine roared as the gunman punched the accelerator and we crossed into the open Afghan desert. I was seated in the back between two Afghan colleagues who were accompanying me on a reporting trip when armed men surrounded our car and took us hostage.\nAnother gunman in the passenger seat turned and stared at us as he gripped his Kalashnikov rifle. No one spoke. I glanced at the bleak landscape outside \u2014 reddish soil and black boulders as far as the eye could see \u2014 and feared we would be dead within minutes.\nIt was last Nov. 10, and I had been headed to a meeting with a Taliban commander along with an Afghan journalist, Tahir Luddin, and our driver, Asad Mangal. The commander had invited us to interview him outside Kabul for reporting I was pursuing about Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nThe longer I looked at the gunman in the passenger seat, the more nervous I became. His face showed little emotion. His eyes were dark, flat and lifeless.\nI thought of my wife and family and was overcome with shame. An interview that seemed crucial hours earlier now seemed absurd and reckless. I had risked the lives of Tahir and Asad \u2014 as well as my own life. We reached a dry riverbed and the car stopped. \u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us,\u201d Tahir whispered. \u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us.\u201d\nTahir and Asad were ordered out of the car. Gunmen from a second vehicle began beating them with their rifle butts and led them away. I was told to get out of the car and take a few steps up a sand-covered hillside.\nWhile one guard pointed his Kalashnikov at me, the other took my glasses, notebook, pen and camera. I was blindfolded, my hands tied behind my back. My heart raced. Sweat poured from my skin.\n\u201cHabarnigar,\u201d I said, using a Dari word for journalist. \u201cSalaam,\u201d I said, using an Arabic expression for peace.\nI waited for the sound of gunfire. I knew I might die but remained strangely calm.\nMoments later, I felt a hand push me back toward the car, and I was forced to lie down on the back seat. Two gunmen got in and slammed the doors shut. The car lurched forward. Tahir and Asad were gone and, I thought, probably dead.\nThe car came to a halt after what seemed like a two-hour drive. Guards took off my blindfold and guided me through the front door of a crude mud-brick home perched in the center of a ravine.\nI was put in some type of washroom the size of a closet. After a few minutes, the guards opened the door and pushed Tahir and Asad inside.\nWe stared at one another in relief. About 20 minutes later, a guard opened the door and motioned for us to walk into the hallway.\n\u201cNo shoot,\u201d he said, \u201cno shoot.\u201d\nFor the first time that day, I thought our lives might be spared. The guard led us into a living room decorated with maroon carpets and red pillows. A half-dozen men sat along two walls of the room, Kalashnikov rifles at their sides. I sat down across from a heavyset man with a patu \u2014 a traditional Afghan scarf \u2014 wrapped around his face. Sunglasses covered his eyes, and he wore a cheap black knit winter cap. Embroidered across the front of it was the word \u201cRock\u201d in English.\n\u201cI\u2019m a Taliban commander,\u201d he announced. \u201cMy name is Mullah Atiqullah.\u201d\nFOR the next seven months and 10 days, Atiqullah and his men kept the three of us hostage. We were held in Afghanistan for a week, then spirited to the tribal areas of Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding.\nAtiqullah worked with Sirajuddin Haqqani, the leader of one of the most hard-line factions of the Taliban. The Haqqanis and their allies would hold us in territory they control in North and South Waziristan.\nDuring our time as hostages, I tried to reason with our captors. I told them we were journalists who had come to hear the Taliban\u2019s side of the story. I told them that I had recently married and that Tahir and Asad had nine young children between them. I wept, hoping it would create sympathy, and begged them to release us. All of my efforts proved pointless.\nOver those months, I came to a simple realization. After seven years of reporting in the region, I did not fully understand how extreme many of the Taliban had become. Before the kidnapping, I viewed the organization as a form of \u201cAl Qaeda lite,\u201d a religiously motivated movement primarily focused on controlling Afghanistan.\nLiving side by side with the Haqqanis\u2019 followers, I learned that the goal of the hard-line Taliban was far more ambitious. Contact with foreign militants in the tribal areas appeared to have deeply affected many young Taliban fighters. They wanted to create a fundamentalist Islamic emirate with Al Qaeda that spanned the Muslim world.\nI had written about the ties between Pakistan\u2019s intelligence services and the Taliban while covering the region for The New York Times. I knew Pakistan turned a blind eye to many of their activities. But I was astonished by what I encountered firsthand: a Taliban mini-state that flourished openly and with impunity.\nThe Taliban government that had supposedly been eliminated by the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was alive and thriving.\nAll along the main roads in North and South Waziristan, Pakistani government outposts had been abandoned, replaced by Taliban checkpoints where young militants detained anyone lacking a Kalashnikov rifle and the right Taliban password. We heard explosions echo across North Waziristan as my guards and other Taliban fighters learned how to make roadside bombs that killed American and NATO troops.\nAnd I found the tribal areas \u2014 widely perceived as impoverished and isolated \u2014 to have superior roads, electricity and infrastructure compared with what exists in much of Afghanistan.\nAt first, our guards impressed me. They vowed to follow the tenets of Islam that mandate the good treatment of prisoners. In my case, they unquestionably did. They gave me bottled water, let me walk in a small yard each day and never beat me.\nBut they viewed me \u2014 a nonobservant Christian \u2014 as religiously unclean and demanded that I use a separate drinking glass to protect them from the diseases they believed festered inside nonbelievers.\nMy captors harbored many delusions about Westerners. But I also saw how some of the consequences of Washington\u2019s antiterrorism policies had galvanized the Taliban. Commanders fixated on the deaths of Afghan, Iraqi and Palestinian civilians in military airstrikes, as well as the American detention of Muslim prisoners who had been held for years without being charged. America, Europe and Israel preached democracy, human rights and impartial justice to the Muslim world, they said, but failed to follow those principles themselves.\nDuring our captivity, I made numerous mistakes. In an effort to save our lives in the early days, I exaggerated what the Taliban could receive for us in ransom. In response, my captors made irrational demands, at one point asking for $25 million and the release of Afghan prisoners from the American detention center at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. When my family and editors declined, my captors complained that I was \u201cworthless.\u201d\nTahir and Asad were held in even lower esteem. The guards incessantly berated both of them for working with foreign journalists and repeatedly threatened to kill them. The dynamic was not new. In an earlier kidnapping involving an Italian journalist and his Afghan colleagues, the Taliban had executed the Afghan driver to press the Italian government to meet their demands.\nDespite the danger, Tahir fought like a lion. He harangued our kidnappers for hours at a time and used the threat of vengeance from his powerful Afghan tribe to keep the Taliban from harming us.\nWe became close friends, encouraging each other in our lowest moments. We fought, occasionally, as well. At all times, an ugly truth hovered over the three of us. Asad and Tahir would be the first ones to die. In post-9/11 Afghanistan and Pakistan, all lives are still not created equal.\nAs the months dragged on, I grew to detest our captors. I saw the Haqqanis as a criminal gang masquerading as a pious religious movement. They described themselves as the true followers of Islam but displayed an astounding capacity for dishonesty and greed.\nOur ultimate betrayal would come from Atiqullah himself, whose nom de guerre means \u201cgift from God.\u201d\nWhat follows is the story of our captivity. I took no notes while I was a prisoner. All descriptions stem from my memory and, where possible, records kept by my family and colleagues. Direct quotations from our captors are based on Tahir\u2019s translations. Undoubtedly, my recollections are incomplete and the passage of time may have affected them. For safety reasons, certain details and names have been withheld.\nOur time as prisoners was bewildering. Two phone calls and one letter from my wife sustained me. I kept telling myself \u2014 and Tahir and Asad \u2014 to be patient and wait. By June, our seventh month in captivity, it had become clear to us that our captors were not seriously negotiating our release. Their arrogance and hypocrisy had become unending, their dishonesty constant. We saw an escape attempt as a last-ditch, foolhardy act that had little chance of success. Yet we still wanted to try.\nTo our eternal surprise, it worked.\nON Oct. 26, 2008, I arrived in Afghanistan on a three-week reporting trip for a book I was writing about the squandered opportunities to bring stability to the region. I had been covering Afghanistan and Pakistan since 2001 and was inspired by the bravery and pride of the people in those two countries and, it seemed, their popular desire for moderate, modern societies.\nThe first part of my visit proved depressing. I spent two weeks in Helmand Province, in southern Afghanistan, and was struck by the rising public support for the Taliban. Seven years of halting economic development, a foreign troop presence and military mistakes that killed civilians had bred a deep resentment of American and NATO forces.\nFor the book to be as rigorous and fair as possible, I decided that I needed to get the Taliban\u2019s side of the story.\nI knew that would mean taking a calculated risk, a decision journalists sometimes make to report accurately in the field. I was familiar with the potential consequences. In 1995, I was imprisoned for 10 days while covering the war in Bosnia. Serbian authorities arrested me after I discovered mass graves of more than 7,000 Muslim men who had been executed in Srebrenica.\nMy detention was excruciating for my family. Promising I would never put them through such an ordeal again, I was cautious through 13 subsequent years of reporting.\nI flew from Helmand to Kabul on Sunday, Nov. 9, to meet with Tahir Luddin, who worked for The Times of London and was known as a journalist who could arrange interviews with the Taliban.\nAfter making some inquiries, Tahir told me that a Taliban commander named Abu Tayyeb would agree to an interview the next day in Logar Province. We could meet him after a one-hour drive on paved roads in a village near an American military base.\nTahir had already interviewed Abu Tayyeb with two other foreign journalists and said he trusted him. He said Abu Tayyeb was aligned with a moderate Taliban faction based in the Pakistani city of Quetta.\nThe danger, he said, would be the drive itself. \u201cNothing is 100 percent,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou only die once.\u201d\nI felt my stomach churn. But if I did the interview, the most dangerous reporting for the book would be over. I could return home with a sense that I had done everything I could to understand the country.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I told Tahir. \u201cTell him yes.\u201d\nThat night, I had dinner with Carlotta Gall, a dear friend and the Kabul bureau chief for The New York Times, and asked her if the interview was a crazy idea. Carlotta said she had never felt the need to interview the Taliban in person and preferred phone conversations. She recommended that we hire a driver to serve as a lookout and end the meeting after no more than an hour.\nI also met with a French journalist who had interviewed Abu Tayyeb twice with Tahir. In the fall of 2007, she spent two days filming him and his men as they trained. In the summer of 2008, she spent an evening with them and filmed an attack on a police post.\nShe pointed out that I was more vulnerable as an American, but she said she thought Abu Tayyeb would not kidnap us. She said she believed that he was trying to use the media to get across the Taliban\u2019s message.\nI slept poorly the night before the interview. I got out of bed early and put on a pair of boxer shorts my wife had given me on Valentine\u2019s Day emblazoned with dozens of \u201cI love you\u201d logos, hoping they would bring good luck.\nI left two notes behind. One gave Carlotta the location of the meeting and instructed her to call the American Embassy if we did not return by late afternoon. The other was to my wife, Kristen, in case something went wrong.\nI walked outside and met Tahir and Asad Mangal, a friend he had hired to work as a driver and lookout. As we drove away, Tahir suggested that we pray for a safe journey. We did.\nDressed in Afghan clothes and seated in the back, I covered my face with a scarf to prevent thieves from recognizing me as a foreigner. Most kidnappings in and around Kabul had been carried out by criminal gangs, not the Taliban.\nFrom the car, I sent Carlotta a text message with Abu Tayyeb\u2019s phone number. I told her to call him if she did not hear from me. If something went wrong along the way, Abu Tayyeb and his men would rescue us. Under Afghan tradition, guests are treated with extraordinary honor. If a guest is threatened, it is the host\u2019s duty to shelter and protect him.\nWe arrived at the meeting point in a town where farmers and donkeys meandered down the road. But none of Abu Tayyeb\u2019s men were there. Tahir called Abu Tayyeb, who instructed us to continue down the road.\nMoments later, I felt the car swerve to the right and stop. Two gunmen ran toward our car shouting commands in Pashto, the local language. The gunmen opened both front doors and ordered Tahir and Asad to move to the back seat.\nTahir shouted at the men in Pashto as the car sped down the road. I recognized the words \u201cjournalists\u201d and \u201cAbu Tayyeb\u201d and nothing else. The man in the front passenger seat shouted something back and waved his gun menacingly. He was small, with dark hair and a short beard. He seemed nervous and belligerent.\nI hoped there had been some kind of mistake. I hoped the gunmen would call Abu Tayyeb, who would vouch for us and order our release. Instead, our car continued down the road, following a yellow station wagon in front of us.\nThe gunman in the passenger seat shouted more commands. Tahir told me they wanted our cellphones and other possessions. \u201cIf they find we have a hidden phone,\u201d Tahir said, \u201cthey\u2019ll kill us.\u201d\n\u201cTell them we\u2019re journalists,\u201d I said. \u201cTell them we\u2019re here to interview Abu Tayyeb.\u201d\nTahir translated what I said, and the driver \u2014 a bearish, bearded figure \u2014 started laughing.\n\u201cWho is Abu Tayyeb? I don\u2019t know any Abu Tayyeb,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the commander here.\u201d\nThey are thieves or members of another Taliban faction, I thought. I knew that what we called the Taliban was really a loose alliance of local commanders who often operated independently of one another.\nI looked at the two gunmen in the front seat. If we somehow overpowered them, I thought, the men in the station wagon would shoot us. I did not want to get Asad and Tahir killed. My arrest in Bosnia had ended peacefully after 10 days. I thought the same might occur here.\nOne of the gunmen said something and Tahir turned to me. \u201cThey want to know your nationality,\u201d he said. I hesitated and wondered whether I should say I was Canadian. Being an American was disastrous, but I thought lying was worse. If they later learned I was American, I would instantly be declared a spy.\n\u201cTell them the truth,\u201d I told Tahir. \u201cTell them I\u2019m American.\u201d\nTahir relayed my answer and the burly driver beamed, raising his fist and shouting a response in Pashto. Tahir translated it for me: \u201cThey say they are going to send a blood message to Obama.\u201d\nBY the time I met face to face later that day with Atiqullah, our kidnapper, I still did not know which Taliban faction had abducted us.\nA large man with short dark hair protruding from the sides of his cap, he appeared self-assured and in clear command of his men. He also seemed suspicious of us, which worried me. I knew many Taliban believed all journalists were spies.\nWith Tahir translating, we explained that we had been invited to Logar Province to interview Abu Tayyeb, the Taliban commander. I said I had worked as The Times\u2019s South Asia correspondent from 2002 to 2005. I described articles I had written during the war in Bosnia and told him that Serbian Orthodox Christians had arrested me there after I had exposed the massacre of Muslims.\nAtiqullah remained unmoved. He denied our request to call Abu Tayyeb or a Taliban spokesman. He controlled our fate now, he announced. Atiqullah handed me the notebook and pen his gunmen had taken from me and ordered me to start writing.\nAmerican soldiers routinely disgraced Afghan women and men, he said. They forced women to stand before them without their burqas, the head-to-toe veils that villagers believe protect a woman\u2019s honor. They searched homes without permission and forced Afghan men to lie on the ground, placing boots on the Afghans\u2019 heads and pushing their faces into the dirt. He clearly viewed the United States as a malevolent occupier.\nHe produced one of our cellphones and announced that he wanted to call The Times\u2019s office in Kabul. I gave him the number, and Atiqullah briefly spoke with one of the newspaper\u2019s Afghan reporters. He eventually handed me the phone. Carlotta, the paper\u2019s Kabul bureau chief, was on the line. I said that we had been taken prisoner by the Taliban.\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Carlotta asked. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d\nAtiqullah demanded the phone back before I could answer. Carlotta \u2014 the most fearless reporter I knew \u2014 sounded unnerved.\nAtiqullah turned off the phone, removed the battery and announced that we would move that night for security reasons. My heart sank. I had hoped that we would somehow be allowed to contact Abu Tayyeb and be freed before nightfall. As we waited in the house, I thought Carlotta would be calling my family and editors at any minute to inform them that I had been kidnapped.\nI awoke before dawn to the sound of the guards performing a predawn prayer with Tahir and Asad. We had been taken to a small dirt house and then spent the day trapped in a claustrophobic room with our three guards. Measuring roughly 20 feet by 20 feet, its only furnishings were the carpet on the floor and a dozen blankets.\nOne of our guards introduced himself as \u201cQari,\u201d an Arabic expression for someone who had memorized the Koran. He later said he was one of the \u201cfedayeen,\u201d an Arabic term the Taliban use for suicide bombers.\nFood arrived at mealtimes, and no one was beaten. Yet Tahir grew increasingly worried. \u201cThese guys are really religious,\u201d he whispered to me at one point. \u201cThey\u2019re really religious. They\u2019re praying a lot.\u201d\nConfined to the room for most of the day, I found it increasingly suffocating. By now, I was sure my family had heard the news.\nSeveral hours after sunset, we were hustled into a small station wagon.\n\u201cWe have to move you for security reasons,\u201d said Atiqullah, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, his face still concealed behind a scarf. Arab militants and a film crew from Al Jazeera were on their way, he said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to chop off your heads,\u201d he announced. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get you out of this area.\u201d\nAs we drove away, I asked for permission to speak. Atiqullah agreed, and I told him we were worth more alive than dead. He asked me what I thought he could get for us. I hesitated, unsure of what to say. I was desperate to keep us alive.\nI knew that in March 2007, the Afghan government exchanged five Taliban prisoners for the Italian journalist after the Taliban executed his driver. Later, they killed his translator as well. My memory of the exchange was vague, but I thought money was included. In August 2007, the South Korean government had reportedly paid $20 million for the release of 21 Korean missionaries after the Taliban killed two members of the group.\n\u201cMoney and prisoners,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHow much money?\u201d Atiqullah asked.\nI hesitated again.\n\u201cMillions,\u201d I said, immediately thinking I would regret the statement.\nAtiqullah and one of his commanders looked at each other.\nOver the next hour, the conversation continued. Atiqullah promised to do his best to protect us. I promised him money and prisoners.\nAs we wound our way through steep mountain passes, Atiqullah asked for the names and professions of my father and brothers. I told him the truth. Given the unusual spelling of my last name, I thought he could easily find my relatives online.\nMy father was a retired insurance salesman, I said. One of my brothers worked for an aviation consulting company. A stepbrother worked for a bank. I thought being forthright was helping convince him that I was a journalist, not a spy.\nFOR the next four days, we lived with Qari, the suicide bomber, in another small dirt house. On one afternoon, he allowed us to sit outside in a small walled courtyard.\nHe even let Tahir play a game on a cellphone. But when Tahir asked for the phone a second time, Qari shouted that we planned to send a text message to the Kabul bureau of The Times. Suddenly enraged and irrational, he denounced us as liars. He picked up his Kalashnikov, pointed it at Tahir\u2019s chest and threatened to shoot him.\nTahir stared back, unmoved. Pashtunwali \u2014 an ancient code of honor practiced by ethnic Pashtuns in Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2014 prevented each man from showing fear and losing face.\nAsad and I stepped in front of Tahir. We begged Qari to put down his gun. \u201cLutfan, lutfan,\u201d I said, using a local expression for please. Qari lowered his weapon but motioned for Tahir to step into an outer room.\nThrough the wall, I heard Tahir begin praying in Arabic. I heard a thump and Tahir cried out, \u201cAllah!\u201d A second thump and \u201cAllah!\u201d Several minutes later, Tahir walked back into the room, crawled under a blanket and began moaning. Qari had beaten him on the back with his rifle.\nQari unnerved me. Earnestly reciting hugely inaccurate propaganda about the West I had seen on jihadi Web sites, Qari seemed utterly detached from reality. Other guards joked that he had mental problems.\nIn my mind, Qari and Atiqullah personified polar ends of the Taliban. Qari represented a paranoid, intractable force. Atiqullah embodied the more reasonable faction: people who would compromise on our release and, perhaps, even on peace in Afghanistan.\nI did not know which one represented the majority. I wanted to believe that Atiqullah did. Yet each day I increasingly feared that Qari was the true Taliban.\nThe following day, Atiqullah arrived to move us again. During the ride, he said we would be taken to a place where I could receive bottled water and we could call our families. He promised to protect me.\n\u201cI will not kill you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will survive.\u201d\nI insisted that he promise to save Tahir and Asad as well. \u201cYou will not kill the three of us,\u201d I said. \u201cIt has to be the three of us.\u201d\nInitially, Atiqullah refused. For days, I raised the issue over and over, remembering that under the Pashtunwali code a promise of protection should be ironclad. At one point, I suggested that he cut off my finger instead of harming Tahir and Asad.\nLater that day, he finally promised to protect all three of us. \u201cI give you my promise,\u201d he said, as I lay down in the back of the station wagon. \u201cI will not kill any of the three of you.\u201d\nThen, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s kill Asad first,\u201d and laughed.\nTHE following afternoon, a new commander arrived. A bone-thin man with a long beard and one arm, he got into the driver\u2019s seat and guided us through barren, rock-strewn territory, steering the car and shifting gears with lightning-quick movements of his one hand.\nAt sunset, he stopped the vehicle, and Atiqullah announced that we would have to walk through the mountains. A large American base blocked the path in front of us, he said. The one-armed commander gave me a pair of worn loafers, and another guard gave me his jacket.\nAs we walked, I understood why Western journalists had grown enamored of the anti-Soviet Afghan resistance fighters in the 1980s. Under a spectacular panorama of stars, we wound our way along a steep mountain pass. Emaciated Taliban fighters carried heavy machine guns with little sign of fatigue. Their grit and resilience seemed boundless.\nI thought about making a run for it but had not had a chance to talk it over with Tahir and Asad. I also knew that the half-dozen guards would quickly shoot us.\nAs the hike continued, I grew suspicious. Atiqullah \u2014 who had promised to carry me if needed \u2014 proved to be in poor shape. On one of the steepest parts of the ascent, he stopped, sat on a rock and panted.\nNine hours after we set out, the sun rose and the hike dragged on. Asad approached me when the guards lagged behind, pointed at the way ahead and whispered, \u201cMiram Shah.\u201d Miram Shah is the capital and largest town in North Waziristan, a Taliban and Qaeda stronghold in Pakistan\u2019s lawless tribal areas. North Waziristan was the home of some of the Taliban\u2019s most hard-line members. If we were headed there, we were doomed.\nAfter 11 hours, our hike finally ended. The guards lighted a fire, and we warmed our hands as we waited for a vehicle to pick us up.\nExhausted and anxious, I told myself that Asad was wrong and Atiqullah was right. I told myself that we were walking into southern Afghanistan, not Pakistan. I told myself we would survive.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/world/asia/18hostage.html", "title": "7 Months, 10 Days in Captivity", "author": "DAVID ROHDE"}

They said that foreigners already holding permits would be allowed to travel to Tibet, but with restrictions, including requirements that they travel only with guides and stay in government-approved hotels. Tour operators said they were told that the ban on new permits would remain until at least Oct. 8.\nYong Hong, deputy sales manager at Xigaze China International Travel Service in Lhasa, said the new rules were unexpected and not particularly welcome. \u201cIt was a sudden thing, but this year is unusual,\u201d he said, referring to the Oct. 1 National Day celebrations marking the founding of the People\u2019s Republic.\nTourism, which makes up nearly 20 percent of the region\u2019s economy, was battered by the rioting last year but has more than recovered, officials say.

{"date": "Fri, 26 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TIRANA, Albania \u2014 With parliamentary elections approaching on Sunday, many Albanians are feeling like Hysen Demiraj, a driver and former political prisoner, who was born in a jail cell during this country\u2019s brutal dictatorship and says he still feels imprisoned in a country that is unfairly isolated and ostracized.\n\u201cWe Albanians are tired of feeling cut off from the world,\u201d Mr. Demiraj, 45, said recently after waiting for hours in a scorching sun for a German visa. \u201cWe are the forgotten part of Europe, and it doesn\u2019t feel so good.\u201d\nThe intense feeling of alienation might seem surprising given that this poor, southern Balkan country joined NATO in April \u2014 a moment of enormous symbolic and psychological resonance for a place severed from the West for over 40 years under the Stalinist leader Enver Hoxha.\nYet Albanians clamor for more. Young and old say they want Albania to join the European Union so they can travel freely to neighboring Greece or Italy, without long visa lines or sneaking in under cover of night, as hundreds of thousands have done since 1990.\nOthers are fed up with life in a country where Amnesty International says more than 18 percent of the population is estimated to live below the poverty line of $2 a day, and adequate health care often depends on a bribe.\nWhether the election is peaceful, free and democratic, analysts and diplomats say, will help determine the progress toward international integration.\nAlbania\u2019s recent application for European Union membership is already facing deep skepticism; the bloc is overextended and fears admitting lawlessness through the back door. Washington, meanwhile, which lobbied hard for Albania\u2019s NATO membership, will be deeply embarrassed if the election goes awry.\nNearly every election here since the fall of Communism in 1991 has been hotly contested, with losers accusing winners of vote-rigging or worse.\nAmbassador Audrey Glover, head of election monitoring here for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, noted that the stakes were higher this time because Europe and the United States were watching closely. \u201cAlbania needs to prove it has embraced Western democratic standards,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t go well, it will make things very difficult.\u201d\nAlbanians could be in for a tumultuous ride. Even before Ms. Glover arrived, the government of Prime Minister Sali Berisha protested her appointment. Mr. Berisha, aides say, is still smarting from the O.S.C.E.\u2019s conclusion in the 1996 elections, when Ms. Glover was head of monitoring, that his Democratic Party had engaged in vote fraud.\nCampaigning has taken a bloody turn. Last week, a regional leader for a small Conservative party was killed in a car blast that members of his party labeled a bomb attack. A week earlier, a young supporter of Mr. Berisha was fatally shot by a man, after an argument over a party campaign poster. In May, an opposition lawmaker was killed.\nEven if the election itself is peaceful, some Western diplomats are alarmed that hundreds of thousands of rural voters do not yet have the necessary identification documents for voting, potentially disenfranchising them. With little to distinguish the policies of the left and the right, the election has come down to a gladiatorial, personality-driven contest between two men. Slightly ahead in polls is the incumbent Mr. Berisha, a former heart surgeon for the Politburo who has refashioned himself as a rightist reformer. His government has been dogged by corruption charges, and he is campaigning on his success at linking Albania to NATO and thus restoring its stature in the world.\nHis challenger is Edi Rama, the mercurial, 6-foot-6 Socialist mayor of Tirana for the past eight years, a former artist who has splashed lurid bright paint on the city\u2019s once-dilapidated buildings, removed 90 tons of garbage from a city that was buried in trash, and invested in education and health care. His authoritarian streak has caused some critics to rename the capital, Tirana, as Tirama.\nMr. Rama\u2019s Socialist Party has accused the prime minister of trying to cover up what it says was the government\u2019s complicity in an explosion in March 2008 in a munitions depot in Gerdec that killed 26 people and injured 300. Mr. Berisha, in turn, has accused Mr. Rama, who has refused to resign as mayor and put his name on his party\u2019s list, of cowardice and treachery. Mr. Rama\u2019s aides say he will resign after the Socialists win the election.\n\u201cEdi Rama, you are going to go in the garbage,\u201d roared Mr. Berisha at a recent rally in Divjake, a small coastal town. Earlier, he challenged the mayor to fight him like Skanderbeg, the national hero who ousted Ottoman forces for a time in the 15th century.\nAltin Raxhimi, an Albanian writer, argued that the election pitted one man who had delivered international prestige against another who was delivering essentials like electricity and clean drinking water. \u201cRama has turned Tirana into a city that now wears lipstick; he made a once unlivable city livable,\u201d he said. \u201cAlbania got into NATO under Berisha, but he is not liked by many Albanians because he is a populist who once brought the country to the brink of civil war.\u201d\nIndeed, many still recoil at memories of 1997 when many of Albania\u2019s three million or so people lost their life savings in a pyramid scheme, prompting thousands to loot the country\u2019s arms stockpile. Nearly 1,500 people were killed. Mr. Berisha, who was president at the time, was forced to resign.\n\u201cAlbania has an image problem in the world and we need to have free and fair elections; otherwise it will drag down the country\u2019s image for years to come,\u201d said Ilir Meta, a former prime minister with the center-left Socialist Movement for Integration. \u201cThe whole world will be watching us.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/world/europe/27albania.html", "title": "Eyes on Europe, Albanians Prepare to Vote", "author": "DAN BILEFSKY"}
{"date": "Wed, 14 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "FORWARD OPERATING BASE NORMANDY, Iraq \u2014 Soldiers have often returned to old battlefields, to honor fallen comrades and to exorcise persistent demons. British soldiers go back to the Falklands. Normandy cemeteries are on many V.F.W. and American Legion itineraries. Vietnam veterans can even get package tours now to the places where they were stationed.\nNow, Americans wounded in the Iraq war are being ferried back to the scenes where they were maimed to help achieve psychological closure, the first time such visits have been tried while a war is still in progress.\nThe seven-day program, called Operation Proper Exit, has been kept quiet previously, partly because returning to a combat zone is considered a delicate experiment. For the eight wounded men who returned to Iraq this week, including five amputees and one blinded soldier, the hope is that returning to places many of them left while unconscious or in agony might reassure them that their losses have been worth it.\nThat appeared to be the case for retired Lt. Edwin Salau. He was one of eight wounded American veterans who lined up on Wednesday to meet Brig. Gen. Farhan Abbas, the Iraqi Army brigade commander in Diyala Province, where the Normandy base is located. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be here and see all the progress,\u201d Lieutenant Salau, whose prosthetic left leg was hidden beneath his baggy uniform, told the Iraqi general. \u201cWe gave a lot for your country and we\u2019re glad for it.\u201d\n\u201cYou should wear your wounds like badges on your chest,\u201d General Farhan said.\nOperation Proper Exit was started by a small foundation in Laurel, Md., Troops First, supported by the U.S.O. and welcomed by the military command in Iraq. This was the second visit to Iraq since June, but the first was kept secret because no one knew for sure how the soldiers would handle their return.\n\u201cThe amount of developmental growth and closure was phenomenal,\u201d said Col. David Sutherland, the former brigade commander in Diyala, who came along on that first trip and said it turned out better than had been hoped. \u201cSome of them said their night terrors stopped after they went.\u201d\nColonel Sutherland was not wounded, at least not physically, but as the brigade commander who lost more soldiers than any other in Diyala \u2014 110 during a long tour from late 2006 until early 2008 \u2014 he, too, found the return important. \u201cI left about 15 pounds of guilt back in Iraq after that trip,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I saw such dramatic change.\u201d\nThe operation has been approved by the Army surgeon general, according to Dr. John Olsen, an Army surgeon who referred to it as \u201can important psychological step.\u201d Dr. Olsen conceded, though, that he was not aware of any medical research that endorsed the therapeutic value of sending wounded veterans back to a conflict zone.\nRick Kell, the head of Troops First, said that the impetus came from wounded soldiers themselves. Working with them at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Mr. Kell said, \u201cI kept hearing every day, \u2018I want to go back, I want to go back.\u2019 \u201d He said the program had been careful to select only returnees who had already shown good progress in coping with their injuries.\nThe veterans got V.I.P. treatment from the moment they arrived on Sunday, meeting with Iraqi and American dignitaries, including Gen. Ray Odierno, the senior American commander in Iraq, attending intelligence briefings and then spending the rest of the week revisiting their old bases around Iraq.\nFor Sgt. Luke Wilson, 29, from Hermiston, Ore., the flight was the first he had ever flown anywhere in business class.\nMr. Kell said, \u201cBusiness class was important, for a 13-hour-long flight, so they could lie down, take their legs off or whatever.\u201d He sold the Proper Exit idea to General Odierno earlier this year.\n\u201cThis has blown me away,\u201d Sergeant Wilson said. He lost his left leg above the knee in a grenade attack in Baghdad in 2004. \u201cI\u2019ve never been treated like this.\u201d\nHe then turned to Lawrence Wilson, the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer in the theater, and asked, \u201cCan I stay, Command Sergeant Major?\u201d\nThe group arrived at this base, near the city of Muqdadiya, northeast of Baghdad, because two of the eight suffered their wounds while here. When they stepped out of the Black Hawk helicopters at the base landing zone on Wednesday, they all walked under their own power to be greeted by American officers and soldiers, clapped on their backs and welcomed as if they were old friends rather than strangers. All of them were in full uniform, including the four retirees; none of their injuries or prostheses were apparent except close up.\nThe two who had been stationed at this forward operation base were Sgt. John Hyland, 38, from San Antonio, who lost his left leg and suffered back injuries when an improvised explosive device hit his Humvee in 2007, and Specialist Craig Chavez, 29, from Temecula, Calif., blinded by a 2006 I.E.D. blast that destroyed his face \u2014 now reconstructed \u2014 and cost him his left eye and most of the vision in his right.\nTo Specialist Chavez, it was a point of pride that he navigated the base without any help. \u201cI do it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I have to.\u201d\nThe soldiers were most struck by the lack of noise here now. \u201cThe biggest thing in the world is the silence,\u201d Sergeant Hyland said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything all week.\u201d Not mortar shells, once common around Normandy, nor the distant sound of an exploding I.E.D.\nSergeant Hyland had a rough time when the group came to the battalion\u2019s memorial hall, with pictures of the 65 American soldiers who died while based here. One was a medic, Specialist Jonathan Rivadeneira, 22, from Queens, who Sergeant Hyland says saved his life in the attack on his Humvee on Sept. 11, 2007. Three days later, Specialist Rivadeneira was killed.\nAlone before the medic\u2019s picture for a moment, Sergeant Hyland began weeping quietly and with difficulty lowered himself onto his good right knee to pray. When he came outside to join everyone for a group picture, he was still shaky, and the other wounded men gathered around him until he regained his composure.\nThere was some good news even in that memorial hall, however. Tim Dotson, the command sergeant major of the unit based here, the Second Battalion, Third Infantry Regiment, pointed to a blank wall to the left of the door. All the other walls were full of pictures.\n\u201cThat wall is blank because the unit we just replaced lost no one,\u201d said Command Sergeant Major Dotson, 44, of San Antonio. \u201cThis is the new Iraq, and what you did here is part of that.\u201d \u201cHoo-ah,\u201d some of the guys muttered approvingly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting ready to turn off the lights, lock it up and go home.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/world/middleeast/15exit.html", "title": "Wounded Soldiers Return to Iraq, Seeking Solace", "author": "ROD NORDLAND"}

The hotel\u2019s registry was swollen at the time of the attack, which occurred about 10 p.m. local time, with officials working for United Nations agencies and other aid groups tending to the large refugee population that has been displaced by the recent fighting in Pakistan between the Pakistani Army and Taliban insurgents.\nOne of the dead was a Russian employee of an international aid organization according to a police official at the scene.\nTwo officials for the World Food Program were wounded, one, from Madagascar, critically, said Paul Risley, a spokesman for the aid agency.\nThe attack followed threats on May 27 by Taliban leaders, who warned Pakistanis that they were preparing \u201cmajor attacks\u201d in large cities in retaliation for the military\u2019s ongoing campaign against the insurgents in parts of Pakistan\u2019s North-West Frontier Province.\nPeshawar, the capital of the province and a gateway to the tribal areas where the Taliban and Al Qaeda have made a base, has been the scene of frequent incursions by the Taliban.\nOn the day of the Taliban warning last week, three bombs detonated in and around Peshawar, including at an electronics market and a police checkpoint, as well as in Dera Ismail Khan, in the country\u2019s troubled west. The bombing Tuesday was the seventh in Peshawar since the military operation began.\nIt was by far the largest \u2014 using an estimated 1,000 pounds of explosives, the police said \u2014 making it the most spectacular against a Western target in Pakistan since the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in the capital, Islamabad, last September, which left more than 50 dead.\n\u201cThe floor under my feet shook,\u201d said Jawad Chaudhry, who was in his room at the Pearl Continental at time of the bombing, according to The Associated Press.\n\u201cI thought the roof was falling on me,\u201d he said. \u201cI ran out. I saw everybody running in panic. There was blood and pieces of glass everywhere.\u201d\nThe Pearl Continental is set back from a main road that is also the location of the Provincial Assembly and the High Court, and its parking lot is a gauntlet of zigzagging barriers to prevent just such an attack.\nBut the attackers employed tactics similar to those used in the assault on May 27 against the headquarters of the Pakistani intelligence service in Lahore, which fell short of its intended target but killed 26 people at a nearby emergency-response unit.\n\u201cThis attack has all the signatures of the Rescue 15 attack in Lahore,\u201d said one Pakistani security official, referring to the emergency-response service that was hit.\nIn both cases, militants shot guards in order to allow a suicide bomber into a secured area. On Tuesday, witnesses and officials said the attack started when three or four assailants on a pickup truck opened fire on a guard post at the gates of the hotel, where cars are routinely scanned for explosives.\n\u201cThe assailants first killed the security guards on the main entrance to lower the electronic barrier and then went inside the main parking lot firing indiscriminately,\u201d said a police official, Safwat Ghayyir. Once the barriers had been lowered, a suicide bomber drove a minivan packed with explosives toward the hotel. It exploded close enough to the building to reduce a large portion of it to rubble.\n\u201cI was going for my night shift, when I heard intense firing,\u201d said a wounded security guard, who identified himself as Nasir. \u201cThen there was a big explosion. I don\u2019t remember what happened next.\u201d\nThe information minister of North-West Frontier Province, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said that 11 people were killed and more than 50 were wounded.\nPeshawar has been under a high state of alert for the past week, after intelligence agencies warned of attacks against landmark buildings.\n\u201cWe are the front line,\u201d said Farahnaz Ispahani, the media advisor to President Asif Ali Zardari. \u201cThis is really a fight for our way of life.

The raids were the culmination of a seven-month investigation involving state and federal officials and the Australian Security and Intelligence Organization, the government\u2019s spy agency.\nPolice said the men, whose ages range from 22 to 26, planned to arm themselves with automatic weapons and stage a guerrilla attack on Holsworthy Barracks, a sprawling military complex set in the scrub lands southwest of Sydney.\n\u201cThis operation has disrupted an alleged terrorist attack that could have claimed many lives,\u201d the acting federal police commissioner, Tony Negus, told reporters in Melbourne. He said the men \u201cwere prepared to inflict a sustained attack on military personnel until they themselves were killed.\u201d\nOfficials say the suspects were affiliated with Al Shabab, an Islamic organization that controls much of southern Somalia and has been waging an insurgency against the country\u2019s fragile, Western-backed transitional government. The United States considers the group a terrorist organization, claiming it harbors Al Qaeda operatives wanted for orchestrating the 1998 bombings of the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\nPolice charged one of the men, 25-year-old Nayef El Sayed, with conspiring to plan or prepare for a terrorist attack. Mr. Sayed did not enter a plea or apply for bail when he appeared briefly before the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday, but refused to stand up when the judge entered the chambers because, his lawyer told the court, his religious beliefs prevented him from standing before anyone but God, according to local reporters who attended the hearing.\nThe magistrate gave the police an eight-hour extension to continue questioning another man, Saney Aweys, into Tuesday night. He and two other suspects have not been charged. Mr. Aweys, who declined legal representation, told the court that he did not know the other three men.\nBut prosecutors said that federal police had intercepted numerous telephone conversations and text messages referring to the planned attack. The authorities said they plan to use these telephone intercepts and video footage of one of the men allegedly arriving at the Holsworthy base on Mar. 28, as evidence.\nThe police said at least one of the men had traveled to Somalia to participate in the insurgency, and members of the group were trying to persuade Islamic leaders to issue a fatwa, or religious edict, supporting the planned attack.\nIf the allegations are true, the men join the ranks of Somali expatriates and Muslim youths who have been drawn to Al Shabab, which means \u201cyouth\u201d in Arabic. Officials in the United States have also been investigating whether a group of young men from Minnesota were recruited by the group to join the influx of foreign militants fighting against Somalia\u2019s transitional government.\nClive Williams, a terrorism expert at the Strategic and Defense Studies Center of the Australian National University, said the added scrutiny on Al Shabab has made it harder for sympathetic Muslim youths to travel to Somalia unnoticed, making conditions ripe for Shabab-inspired attacks elsewhere.\n\u201cNow that it has become more difficult to go there, the alternative is to go somewhere else, or do something in your home country,\u201d said Mr. Williams. \u201cGiven that Australia\u2019s foreign policy is closely aligned with that of the United States in many areas, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, it would make sense to wage an attack Australia to protest against Australia\u2019s policies.\u201d\nPrime Minister Kevin Rudd said the arrests offered a sobering reminder of the \u201cenduring threat from terrorism at home, here in Australia, as well as overseas.\u201d\nAustralia has not had a major attack on its territory in recent years.\nHowever, a number of people are serving lengthy prison sentences for plots that have been uncovered since the government imposed tough anti-terror laws in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001. Dozens of Australians have been killed in attacks overseas, including three people who were killed in simultaneous suicide bomb attacks at two American hotels in Jakarta, Indonesia, last month.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/world/asia/04australia.html", "title": "Australia Police Hold 4 in Terror Plot", "author": "MERAIAH FOLEY"}

The victory would further cement the power of Mr. Correa, an American-educated economist first elected in 2006 when voters repudiated an elite that had overseen a chronically unstable political system.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a historic step in consolidating our social revolution,\u201d an ebullient Mr. Correa said Sunday afternoon after exit polls signaled his victory.\nNelson Basantes, 47, who voted at the Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar School in a working-class district here, said, \u201cCorrea is the only leader in this country capable of putting our house in order.\u201d Mr. Basantes, a paper recycler, said he admired Mr. Correa\u2019s efforts to alleviate economic misery by providing poor families with a $30 payment each month.\nLow oil prices are already straining Mr. Correa\u2019s hopes of sustaining such social spending. Since Ecuador defaulted on its foreign debt in December, hard currency reserves have fallen by about a third to $3 billion. Rising unemployment in Spain and the United States, countries with large numbers of Ecuadorean immigrants, is also pushing remittances lower.\nMr. Correa, 46, has responded to the sharp economic slowdown by seeking more than $1 billion in loans from China and imposing restrictions on hundreds of imported products in an attempt to prevent United States dollars, used here as the official currency, from flowing out of the country.\nThe 7.4 percent inflation rate, while lower than in many neighboring countries, also weighed on some voters. Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez, the former president, ran advertisements raising alarm about the rising cost of basic foods.\nBut many voters said they still had faith in Mr. Correa to address such fears.\n\u201cCorrea is better than the thieves that came before him,\u201d said Mariana S\u00e1nchez, 52, a street vendor.\nMr. Correa, who won approval of a new Constitution last September that eroded checks on the presidency, has emerged as Ecuador\u2019s most powerful president since military rule ended here in 1979. The country\u2019s 10th leader since 1996, he will start a new four-year term with a chance of re-election, if the preliminary returns from Sunday hold up.\nIndeed, even Ecuador\u2019s once unruly legislature, which ousted presidents with ease, has increasingly come under his sway.\nCiting the greater centralization of power at a time of political stability, Michael Shifter, vice president of Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, said \u201cit is less clear what kind of democracy is being constructed.\u201d\n\u201cFor now such a trade-off seems acceptable for most Ecuadoreans,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when economic conditions worsen, there may be greater discontent with virtually one-man rule.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/world/americas/27ecuador.html", "title": "Ecuador Re-elects President, Preliminary Results Show", "author": "SIMON ROMERO"}
{"date": "Mon, 02 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 India, the world\u2019s largest democracy, will hold its next national elections over four weeks starting next month, election officials announced Monday afternoon, as the country\u2019s leading national parties scrambled to join forces with a host of regional and caste-based parties under the shadow of a deepening economic slowdown.\nIndia has been ruled by coalition governments for over a decade, making the country\u2019s national parties increasingly reliant on smaller factions. That trend is only expected to intensify.\nIn a vast and fractious exercise scheduled to take place in five phases between April 16 and May 13, 714 million voters will be eligible to elect the next legislature. Votes will be counted on May 16, and a new government will have to be formed by June, when the current Congress Party-led coalition government\u2019s five year term comes to an end.\nThe elections come amid a global economic crisis that has damaged India\u2019s economy less than many other countries, but has slowed its once-roaring rate of growth. India reported that its economy grew 5.3 percent in the quarter ended in December; the rate was 7.6 percent in the earlier quarter, and 9 percent in final quarter of the prior year. Still, the incumbent government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will have to defend its record against charges of mismanagement from its main rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party.\nNeither national party is likely to win enough seats in the 543-seat parliament without joining forces with other parties. If neither party wins enough seats to command a coalition, the door will be opened to what is known here as a third front: a loose cartel of smaller parties joining together to form a government.\nThe economy is expected to dominate the polls in a country where nearly one in four eligible voters are estimated to be under the age of 30. The electorate contains 43 million first-time voters. Age does not seem to be a hurdle to India\u2019s leading politicians. The leader of the B.J.P., Lal Krishna Advani, is 80, while Mr. Singh, the Congress Party\u2019s presumed prime ministerial candidate, is 76.\nFor the election commission, just scheduling a national election is complicated enough, balancing holidays, religious festivals, planting seasons, monsoons and school exams. The scale of the actual elections is another matter. More than 828,000 polling stations will be set up. They will be staffed by 4 million election workers; an additional 2.1 million police and home guards are due to be deployed. The polling will take place in phases in order to ensure sufficient security across the country.\nMost seats for the legislature have been redrawn; the redistricting will give greater representation to India\u2019s outcastes and indigenous tribes.\nThe three-member election commission itself has been under a rare cloud, with the chief election commissioner, N. Gopalaswami, accusing one of his fellow panelists, Navin Chawla, of pro-Congress partisanship and calling for his removal. The Indian president, Pratibha Patil, rejected the request over the weekend, at the advice of the Congress-led government.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/world/asia/03india.html", "title": "Indian Elections Scheduled for April and May", "author": "SOMINI SENGUPTA"}

{"date": "Fri, 13 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LVIV, Ukraine \u2014 When patients began arriving in Vyacheslav Bonder\u2019s intensive care unit two weeks ago, their lungs so saturated with blood that they could barely gasp, the only thing he could compare it to was a field hospital in wartime. As soon as he hooked one patient up to a ventilator, a second and third would appear in the doorway.\nBy that time, hospitals were clearing wards to make room for a wave of pneumonia cases, and people were crowding into drugstores to buy whatever they could get their hands on. Rumors were circulating that the government had ordered the city aerially sprayed with chemicals, to cure Lviv (pronounced luh-VEEVE) of disease or, in a grimmer version, to exterminate its carriers.\nThe panic lifted almost as quickly as it had arrived, and the World Health Organization announced Friday that the swine flu illnesses and deaths so far in Ukraine \u2014 265 fatalities nationwide, with 87 in the Lviv region \u2014 were statistically no worse than those in other countries. But what happened here has drawn rapt attention from experts bracing for the epidemic to hit Europe, and especially the fragile health care systems of countries of the former Soviet Union.\nEarly findings are that serious cases mounted because the sick avoided hospitalization until their illness was dangerously advanced, stockpiles of Tamiflu were locked in centralized locations and the supply of ventilators fell short, said David Mercer, of the World Health Organization\u2019s European regional office.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like this caught us by surprise; we\u2019ve known for months that this was coming,\u201d said Dr. Mercer, who heads the office\u2019s communicable disease unit. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working very hard on plans, but sometimes the battle plan doesn\u2019t survive the first contact with the enemy. We\u2019ve had to change a lot of things on the fly.\u201d\nWith the worst of the health care crisis here past, many in Ukraine\u2019s western provinces are trying to puzzle out what led to it. Doctors blame the news media and politicians for spreading fear and misinformation. The mayors of Ternopyl and Lviv, which reported their first deaths from atypical pneumonia on Oct. 12 and 19, have complained that the federal epidemiological service refused to act without laboratory confirmation that the virus was present, delaying serious measures by nearly two weeks.\nOthers point to more remote causes, among them the desperate poverty of Ukraine\u2019s health care system 20 years after the Soviet Union collapsed.\nIn Lviv, senior doctors earn a monthly salary of 1,500 hryvnas, approximately $184, pay so low that many physicians leave their practices to work as home health aides in Western Europe. Though health care is officially free, patients typically pay a stream of cash bribes for services as large as X-rays and as small as blood tests or linen changes.\nUkrainians rely heavily on home remedies, and that is what they did for the third and fourth weeks of October, resorting to garlic and lemons and waiting so long to check into hospitals that by the time they did, many were beyond treatment.\n\u201cMedicine is underdeveloped in Ukraine, and people don\u2019t believe in it \u2014 it\u2019s a vicious circle,\u201d said Oleh Berezuk, a physician who heads the mayor\u2019s administration in Lviv. \u201cIn a mature country, if you get sick you will not say, \u2018Nobody can help me.\u2019 \u201d\nNow, the doctors at Lviv\u2019s main pulmonological hospital have the shaky good humor of people who have come through a crisis, though portions of their hospital are clammy and unlighted (\u201cto scare the viruses,\u201d one doctor joked), and some of their breathing equipment dates from Soviet times.\nTwo weeks ago, though, doctors here thought they were looking at a medical mystery: the deaths of healthy young people \u2014 not the drunks or addicts they usually see \u2014 with lungs so inflamed that they resembled liver. Dr. Bonder recalls the numb realization that his ordinary protocol for treating pneumonia was having no impact at all.\n\u201cYou would come in to work and the next time you looked at your watch it was midnight,\u201d said Dr. Bonder, who heads the intensive care unit. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even think what could happen next.\u201d\nNurses and doctors were falling ill at an alarming rate, in part because of shortages of gloves and disinfectant. Irina Mykychak, the assistant director of Lviv\u2019s regional medical department, said around 3,500 medical professionals fell ill, of whom 300 were hospitalized and 4 died.\nWhen they did suspect H1N1, physicians were stuck in a Catch-22. Though the government had stockpiled Tamiflu in preparation for an outbreak they expected later in the year, the drug was available only at the region\u2019s single infectious disease station \u2014 and only with proof that a patient had H1N1. Obtaining proof was a three-to-four-day process that required that samples be sent to Kiev, said Lyubomir Rak, the hospital\u2019s director.\nNadia Rudnitskaya, chief of pulmonology, was carefully putting the pieces together. On Oct. 27, she examined the body of a 32-year-old man \u2014 the latest in a series of four deaths from four parts of western Ukraine that, as she put it, \u201cshouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Dr. Rudnitskaya gathered her samples together and appealed urgently to Kiev.\nRight then the logjam broke: The next day the governor ordered a quarantine and released the emergency stockpile of Tamiflu to clinics and hospitals. A day after that, Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko announced on television that the virus had \u201creached epidemic threshold,\u201d and all of Ukraine was talking about H1N1.\n\u201cIt was a riddle,\u201d Dr. Rudnitskaya said. \u201cThere was an answer.\u201d\nFor some, it came too late. Marta and Nazar Martin insisted that their mother, Galina, 43, check into a hospital on Oct. 23, after her cough worsened into shallow, labored panting. A dentist, she had been treating herself with intravenous antibiotics and flu medications, as she had always done before.\n\u201cNo one knew there was an epidemic,\u201d said Marta, 18. \u201cNothing was said, not at work, not on television.\u201d\nThe hospital offered no answers either. Doctors first prescribed antibiotics for bronchitis, then punctured Ms. Martin\u2019s spinal column to test for meningitis and encephalitis, then gave her an M.R.I. to rule out a brain tumor. With every new prescription, her children scraped up the money and set off to find a pharmacy where it was available, Marta said.\n\u201cA poor person would just die,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will not start a medication until you pay for it.\u201d\nOn Oct. 29, when information about H1N1 flooded the region, doctors and nurses showed up wearing masks for the first time, Nazar said. He watched incredulously; his mother had already declined so much that she was \u201chalf a corpse,\u201d he said. After she died, the next day, samples from her body were sent to be tested for swine flu.\nHer children estimate they paid 35,000 hryvna, or about $4,300, in cash payments to nurses and doctors during the week she spent in the hospital. The more they hear about swine flu, the angrier they get.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they take measures before then?\u201d said Nazar Martin, 19. \u201cI\u2019m interested in knowing what they were thinking. They took this seriously only when people began to die, when the death statistics began to rise. Where were they before then?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s on their conscience,\u201d he said, of the medical authorities. \u201cThey should have done something to prevent it.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/world/europe/14flu.html", "title": "Fragile Care Worsened Swine Flu in Ukraine", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}

It said that guards at the \u201cblack jails\u201d beat, sexually abused, intimidated and robbed men, women and teenagers.\nProvincial and municipal officials in China are subject to a national civil service system that penalizes them based on the number of complaints received in Beijing about their management. So local and provincial officials have a strong incentive to prevent petitioners from reaching the central government.\nSophie Richardson, the advocacy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, said that abuses were widespread in China\u2019s prison system, which has some judicial supervision, but that they were worse in unofficial jails.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a country with torture in formal detention centers, and the black jails are 10 floors down\u201d in terms of the treatment of detainees, she said.\nJeffrey Bader, the National Security Council director for East Asian affairs, said Monday in a conference call with reporters that President Obama planned to raise human rights issues with President Hu Jintao when they meet next week in Beijing. While Mr. Bader did not mention the unofficial jails, he did say that Mr. Obama would discuss \u201crule of law,\u201d a phrase that would cover a range of extrajudicial practices.\nThe jails have been the subject of news reports inside and outside China, but the new report offers many details of abuses. Central government officials continue to deny the jails exist.\n\u201cThere are no black jails in China,\u201d Qin Gang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a regular news conference in Beijing on Thursday. \u201cIf citizens have complaints and suggestions about government work, they can convey them to the relevant authorities through legitimate and normal channels.\u201d\nChina has taken steps in recent months to safeguard the legal rights of those who run afoul of the authorities. New regulations drafted by the Ministry of Public Security and released on Monday by the State Council, or cabinet, ban forced labor at government-authorized detention centers, where people accused of crimes are held before trial. The new rules also bar officials at detention centers from charging detainees for expenses like food.\nBut Nicholas Bequelin, a Hong Kong researcher for Human Rights Watch, said that the new rules did nothing to help detainees at unofficial jails.\nThe unofficial jails have captured attention in recent months.\nAccording to Chinese news media, a guard at an unofficial jail in an inexpensive guesthouse pleaded guilty on Nov. 4 to raping a 20-year-old woman from Anhui Province who had come to Beijing to complain about harassment at her university. Nearly a dozen people reportedly witnessed the rape, and about 50 detainees, including the woman, managed to escape jail when the guard fled after the assault.\nThe court dismissed charges against the guesthouse and two provincial liaison officials, according to the official China Daily newspaper.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/world/asia/13china.html", "title": "Group Accuses China of Abuses in Secret Jails", "author": "KEITH BRADSHER"}

{"date": "Fri, 09 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PRAGUE \u2014 President Vaclav Klaus revealed his objection to the European Union\u2019s Lisbon Treaty on Friday: a provision on property rights.\nMr. Klaus said he feared that the provision, part of the treaty\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights, could be used as a legal basis for a flood of property claims related to the expulsion of three million Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II.\nHe demanded a special exemption from the Charter for the Czech Republic, a gambit that could plunge the bloc into turmoil by unhinging the treaty\u2019s delicate ratification process at the last minute. But some Czech observers said Mr. Klaus\u2019s move was a face-saving maneuver aimed at clearing the way for him to sign a treaty he has long ridiculed.\nFollowing a recent \u201cyes\u201d vote in Ireland in favor of the treaty, and the signing by the Polish president in a ceremony on Saturday, Mr. Klaus is the last hold-out on the treaty, which would give the union a more powerful foreign policy chief and its first full-time president, among other changes. The treaty must be ratified by all 27 Union member states in order to come into force.\nThe Czech Parliament has ratified the document but Mr. Klaus has so far refused to sign it. In addition, 17 senators have challenged the document at the country\u2019s constitutional court, which has yet to rule.\nMr. Klaus said he wanted the Czech Republic to have an opt-out of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which lays down the basic human rights of all European Union citizens, including property rights.\n\u201cI have always considered this treaty a step in the wrong direction,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cIt will deepen the problems the E.U. is facing today, it will increase its democratic deficit, worsen the standing of our country and expose it to new risks, among other things also because it endangers the legal status of the citizens and the stability of property rights in our country.\u201d\nPrime Minister Jan Fischer said Friday that the government, in its review of the treaty, had not found any risk that it would open the door to property claims. And he insisted that the country could still complete ratification of the treaty by the end of the year, despite Mr. Klaus\u2019s latest demand.\nBut Union officials said the changes requested by Mr. Klaus would require, at the bare minimum, that a revised treaty noting the exception be ratified again by the Czech Parliament, and probably by all other 26 member nations, too. That would mean a delay unacceptable to most nations.\nJerzy Buzek, the president of the European Parliament who met Mr. Klaus on Friday in Prague, said he was optimistic that Mr. Klaus\u2019s demand could be satisfied by other means. Mr. Buzek, a former Polish prime minister, noted, for example, that Poland and Britain had already secured opt-outs from the charter.\nPoland wanted assurances that the Union could not impose laws on social issues such as abortion, while Britain did not want provisions such as the right to strike.\nLegal experts noted that one solution to avert a unionwide crisis could be for the bloc\u2019s 26 other member states to issue a declaration at a summit meeting later this month in Brussels agreeing to Czech demands. Such a declaration was used to address Irish concerns about the treaty after Ireland rejected it in a referendum in June 2008.\nUnlike the Czech Republic, Poland and Britain negotiated their charter opt-outs before the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty started.\nSome Czechs said Mr. Klaus\u2019s attempt to link the Lisbon Treaty to post-war property claims, long an emotional issue here, was a populist maneuver. Others said the famously contrarian Mr. Klaus was seeking to assert his power and grab the spotlight. Formally, the Czech President has a largely ceremonial role; in practice, in the 20 years since Communist rule ended the office has been held only by two dominating figures, Vaclav Havel and his fierce rival, Mr. Klaus.\nMr. Klaus may be using Lisbon \u201cto change a parliamentary system into a semi-presidential system,\u201d Mirek Topolanek, the former Czech prime minister, this week told the Prague Post, an English-language newspaper.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/world/europe/10union.html", "title": "Czech President Objects to Treaty\u2019s Property Rights", "author": "DAN BILEFSKY and STEPHEN CASTLE"}

He was 90.\nThe cause was a variety of cardiovascular problems, said a spokesman for the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, the state-sponsored body that oversees French language and usage, on which Mr. Druon served for more than four decades.\nMr. Druon was a prolific man of letters, the author of plays, essay collections, political treatises and more than a dozen novels, one of which, \u201cLes Grandes Familles,\u201d a portrait of the pained inner workings of a powerful family, won France\u2019s most prestigious literary award, the Prix Goncourt, in 1948. He wrote a popular and critically praised series of historical novels, collectively known as \u201cLes Rois Maudits\u201d (\u201cThe Accursed Kings\u201d), about French and English royalty in the 14th century, and a narrative of Greek mythology presented as the memoirs of Zeus.\nBut it might be for a song lyric that he was most revered. In 1943, living in London as a young cavalry officer with the Free French forces in exile under Charles de Gaulle, he and his uncle, the writer Joseph Kessel, heard a simple marchlike tune with an unusual structure of repeated 11-syllable lines. The melody had been written by Anna Marly, a Russian-born troubadour; her original lyrics were written in Russian and had been translated into English. Mr. Druon and his uncle adapted them into French \u2014 they retained little of Ms. Marly\u2019s original language but kept the word \u201ccrows\u201d as a metaphor for Nazi warplanes \u2014 and the song, which became known as \u201cChant des Partisans\u201d (\u201cSong of the Partisans\u201d) quickly became an anthem of the French resistance, second in its patriotic power only to \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d\nMaurice Druon was born in Paris on April 23, 1918. He was educated in Paris and served in the French cavalry, escaping to Britain through Spain after the Franco-German armistice of 1940. He had no children. He is survived by his second wife, Madeleine, whom he married in 1968.\nIn 1966, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, which was founded by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635 and is charged with the arbitration of French linguistic matters, revising the official French dictionary and determining which contemporary locutions ought to be admitted into the language. At the time he was the youngest of the academy\u2019s 40 members, who are appointed for life and known as \u201cthe immortals,\u201d but he would become its leader, or, as the post is called, its perpetual secretary.\nEspecially in matters linguistic, Mr. Druon was known as a cultural conservative who argued against relaxing the historical gender assignments given to all French nouns. He thought it foolish political correctness, for instance, to allow a woman serving as a government minister to be referred to as \u201cla ministre\u201d rather than \u201cle ministre\u201d; the word \u201cministre\u201d was male, he said, no matter who held the post. However, Mr. Druon was also, from his World War II days, an Anglophile, and he allowed many English terms into the French lexicon, including \u201ctweed\u201d and the golf term \u201cbirdie,\u201d according to Agence France-Presse. He served as France\u2019s culture minister from 1973 to 1974.\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy called Mr. Druon \u201ca great writer, a great Resistance fighter, a great politician and a great soul.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/world/europe/16druon.html", "title": "Maurice Druon, Prolific Writer, Dies at 90", "author": "BRUCE WEBER"}

Members of Parliament from Ghazni also support removing the governor, said legislators who attended a hearing in Parliament on Tuesday.\nCalls for the governor\u2019s ouster are the latest test for Mr. Karzai\u2019s government, which has been criticized as weak and undermined by corruption. The commission\u2019s action must be ratified by Mr. Karzai before it can be carried out, said the commission chairman, Abdul Jabar Sholgari, who said he also supported removing the governor, a Karzai appointee.\nA spokesman for Mr. Karzai said Wednesday that the office of the president was evaluating the Parliament\u2019s suggestion and declined to comment further.\nA spokesman for Mr. Usmani, Ismail Jahangir, referred questions to the governor, but repeated attempts to reach Mr. Usmani were unsuccessful.\nIn Ghazni, 80 miles southwest of Kabul, provincial council members have been refusing to work for almost two months to protest what they describe as the governor\u2019s involvement in corruption.\nIn a written complaint to the Parliament, the council said corruption in Ghazni included the smuggling of chromite; the theft of gasoline tankers; the sale of passports for $300; the sale of government jobs; and the support of illegal armed militias.\nThe director of the Afghan Independent Directorate for Local Governance, which is involved in the appointment of governors and reports to the president, said a delegation must investigate before action could be taken.\n\u201cI am sure there is a problem, but I can\u2019t do anything unless it is proven by an impartial delegation,\u201d said the director, Jelani Popal.\nBut some Ghazni provincial council members and legislators said they feared that a delegation would be subject to intimidation or official pressure.\n\u201cI am sure you are going to face pressure from people who can do this and that to you,\u201d Daoud Sultanzoy, a member of Parliament from Ghazni and a potential presidential candidate, told Mr. Popal and an Interior Ministry official. \u201cWe have sympathy with you.

{"date": "Fri, 25 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ROME \u2014 Stung by the televised knockdown of Pope Benedict XVI at Christmas Eve Mass \u2014 by a woman who had sought to assault him a year ago \u2014 the Vatican said Friday it would review security procedures, raising the possibility of more stringent public access to the pope, leader of the world\u2019s 1.1 billion Catholics.\nBenedict, 82, was unhurt. He quickly recovered and celebrated Mass, and he looked well hours later as he delivered his traditional Christmas Day greeting from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Friday. A French cardinal caught in the scuffle suffered a fractured thighbone.\nThe assailant, identified by the Vatican as Susanna Maiolo, a 25-year-old Swiss-Italian national with a history of mental problems, was held for questioning and hospitalized in Rome. She was not under formal arrest, and it was unclear whether she would face charges.\nYet the assault on the pope, captured on television and by tourist cameras and replayed countless times, raised serious questions about Vatican, and Italian, security. It was the first direct attack on Benedict since he became pope in 2005, and it came less than two weeks after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was hospitalized after a mentally unstable man struck him at a campaign rally.\nBoth leaders see walking among their supporters as central to their roles.\nThe televised images of the assault on the pope also underscored his vulnerability in the midst of throngs of people, and they brought to mind the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981 by Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turkish gunman, in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Mr. Agca is to be released from a Turkish prison next month.\nPapal security is provided by the Vatican gendarmes, a private police force; the Swiss Guards, who are more akin to an army; and Italian law enforcement.\nThe Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said that in response to the attack, \u201cI think the Vatican gendarmes, the Swiss Guards and the other officials will do their reflections.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Vatican said Ms. Maiolo was not armed. But compounding the security questions, the Vatican said that Ms. Maiolo had tried the same thing last year, only to be stopped by security before she could do any harm. She had traveled to Rome from Switzerland, the news agency ANSA reported.\nIt is not difficult to imagine how the assailant had become a repeat offender. To attend Mass at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, visitors must request tickets in advance, but they are not personalized and the Vatican does not check identification. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, it did, however, begin sending Mass participants through metal detectors.\nFather Lombardi said that he did not anticipate major changes in protocol \u2014 or the possibility of \u201czero risk\u201d \u2014 since the Vatican is generally opposed to measures that segregate the pope from his flock.\n\u201cThe closeness between the pope and the people is fundamental to the pastoral dimension of the church,\u201d Father Lombardi said. \u201cSecurity that tries to close off the pope and keep him away from people is not desirable.\u201d\nFather Lombardi said that \u201cif the pope wants to be among people, it is impossible to have total security.\u201d\nNonetheless, the review of how the pope\u2019s protectors do their job suggested that Vatican security officials could tighten public access to him.\nThe situation at Christmas Eve Mass was dramatic. Television cameras showed a woman in a red jacket vaulting over the barriers as the papal procession entered the main aisle of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. After landing at the pope\u2019s feet, the woman pulled on his vestments, causing him to lose his balance and fall as security guards grabbed her, Father Lombardi said\nIn the confusion, the French cardinal, Roger Etchegaray, also fell, and he was taken away in a wheelchair. The cardinal, who is 87, broke his femur, Father Lombardi said, but is recovering well at a Rome hospital.\nFather Lombardi said that Ms. Maiolo was being monitored in a medical facility and that he did not know whether the Vatican would pursue any legal actions. The Vatican, an independent state, would have to formally petition the Italian authorities on any judicial action.\n\u201cIt seems the issue is more about treating this woman medically more than juridically,\u201d Father Lombardi said.\nBenedict is said to be in fine health, but he had moved Christmas Eve Mass to 10 p.m. from midnight to save his strength for his demanding public schedule during the holidays.\nOn Friday, Benedict looked well as he gave his traditional \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d message \u201cto the city and the world\u201d and offered Christmas greetings in a host of different languages from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.\nIn his message, Benedict said that the Catholic Church was in solidarity with \u201ca human family profoundly affected by a grave financial crisis, yet even more by a moral crisis, and by the painful wounds of wars and conflicts.\u201d\nHe spoke of the conflict in Iraq and the \u201clittle flock of Christians\u201d in the Middle East. \u201cAt times it is subject to violence and injustice, but it remains determined to make its own contribution to the building of a society opposed to the logic of conflict and the rejection of one\u2019s neighbor,\u201d Benedict said.\nThe pope also singled out Honduras, which has been politically unstable since its president was ousted in a coup in June, and where its newly elected leader is not universally recognized. Benedict said that in Honduras the church was helping in the \u201cprocess of rebuilding institutions.\u201d\nHe also referred to the situation of Christians in Sri Lanka, the Korean Peninsula and the Philippines, and in Africa called for more human rights in Guinea and Niger, and pleaded for an end to conflict in Madagascar.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/world/europe/26pope.html", "title": "Vatican Reviews Papal Protection After Assault", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}
{"date": "Sat, 10 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PARIS \u2014 The 2,000 illegal immigrants camped in this vacant warehouse are not hiding. Quite the contrary.\nThese West Africans, Turks, Pakistanis and Chinese have done all they can to publicize their camp, a sprawling colony of mattresses and cardboard, quilts and concrete at 14, rue Baudelique, in the 18th Arrondissement. They march every Wednesday, distributing fliers, hanging banners and hoping to rally public support as they petition the state for legal status. It is a gamble, though, a knowing admission of guilt: they are seemingly flirting with deportation.\n\u201cIf it is going to come, it will come \u2014 it is destiny,\u201d said Moussa Konte, 36, who arrived here from Mali nine years ago. He flashed a knowing smile. \u201cBut I do still prefer that it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nKnown as \u201csans-papiers\u201d \u2014 people without papers \u2014 their approach is bold, but by no means uncommon. Illegal workers regularly hold labor strikes here, demanding that their employers procure them residency permits. And for years, immigrants have been forcing their way into French churches, government offices and universities, refusing to leave without guarantees that they will be considered for \u201cregularization.\u201d\nThe Rue Baudelique camp is almost unparalleled, though, in both scale and visibility. But the government has made no move to shut it.\n\u201cIn practice, in France we don\u2019t do police checks in public shelters, for example, where there are lots of sans-papiers,\u201d said Marie Lajus, a spokeswoman for Paris\u2019s police prefecture. The same goes for camps like the one in the Rue Baudelique, she said; the police often negotiate the immigrants\u2019 departure from such a site without deportations.\nSans-papiers have long proved to be an awkward issue for the government. While many French have called for tightened restrictions on illegal immigration, which is widely viewed as a colossal drain on state services, government action against sans-papiers has historically drawn public reproach.\nThe French still proudly refer to their nation as the birthplace of human rights, and France remains a bastion of social activism; the country\u2019s labor unions have also taken up the sans-papiers\u2019 cause, inscribing them in France\u2019s rich tradition of workers\u2019 struggles.\n\u201cFrance remains a welcoming country, even if it is stiffening its immigration policies,\u201d said Djibril Diaby, the leader of the sans-papiers\u2019 association that organized the Paris camp. He came to France from Senegal in 1999, and received his papers in 2003. Mr. Diaby, 35, now hosts a Thursday morning radio show called \u201cThe Voice of the Sans-papiers.\u201d\nThe immigrants began arriving in the Rue Baudelique on July 17. About 1,200 came en masse from an administrative building near the Place de la R\u00e9publique. A yearlong occupation there won 126 residency permits, renewable annually \u2014 a typically modest success, organizers conceded, but a success nonetheless. Only one man was deported, and he has reportedly made his way back to Paris.\nAt the new camp, one or two sans-papiers receive residency permits every day, organizers said. Word of their success has spread, and immigrants have been flocking to the Rue Baudelique from across the Paris region: since mid-July, an additional 800 or so have arrived, according to organizers.\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen such a crazy number of people,\u201d Mr. Diaby said. Asked why the immigrants living at the camp had not been rounded up and sent away, he erupted in laughter.\n\u201cIt is a bit surprising,\u201d he admitted. But, paradoxically, it is their very visibility that seems to protect them.\n\u201cThey can do identity checks in the street, stop people in the street,\u201d he said, referring to the police, who routinely detain lone sans-papiers. \u201cMass arrests, the French are not ready for that. French national opinion wouldn\u2019t accept it, and the government knows this.\u201d\nGovernment estimates have placed France\u2019s illegal immigrant population near 400,000; the country has deported over half that number in the past two decades, official statistics show. President Nicolas Sarkozy was elected in 2007 with a pledge to stiffen immigration policies; his government is aiming to expel 27,000 sans-papiers in 2009, about triple the annual average from 10 years ago.\nBut France remains relatively generous compared with other European nations. The country awards citizenship to about 150,000 applicants annually, which ranks it second in the European Union. In 2008, it received and granted more asylum requests than any other nation on the continent, according to government and United Nations numbers.\nAnd the sans-papiers have had particularly strong support from France\u2019s leftist political parties and powerful labor unions, where populist ideology runs deep.\nFor the sans-papiers themselves, the overthrow of the bourgeoisie remains, at best, a distant concern. From Mali, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone, but also Ukraine, Kurdistan and Bolivia \u2014 19 nations in all, at the camp \u2014 most of them arrived with more modest aspirations.\n\u201cI came to feed my family, and myself,\u201d said Nouha Marega, a bashful man who is 32. \u201cI came for my life.\u201d\nOn July 11, 2001, Mr. Marega left Mali on a direct flight to Paris with a three-month visa and little else. He has since worked in construction, pouring concrete, and at a recycling plant, sorting plastic bottles with his long, slender fingers. Raised on glossy photos of Paris\u2019s gilded monuments and grand boulevards, Mr. Marega said he never expected to find himself living in a warehouse, out of a job \u2014 he was fired in mid-August, he said, after asking his employer for a full-time post \u2014 and still without papers.\nMost of the sans-papiers at the Rue Baudelique camp work under the table, they said, earning six to eight euros an hour, or the equivalent of $8.80 to $11.80 (the legal minimum wage is 8.82 euros, or $13). Others work under the names of legal friends. And a majority say they pay taxes \u2014 social security payments are automatically withheld from their paychecks, though they have no access to the corresponding benefits.\nA steady stream of men, mostly Africans, mostly moving with the tired gait of the day laborer, flows in and out of 14, rue Baudelique. Despite their efforts to attract popular attention, most of the sans-papiers\u2019 energy is dedicated to the day to day. Neighbors say their presence has been little felt, but it has stirred debate.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take in all the world\u2019s misery,\u201d said Fabian de Villars, 54, a chain-smoking gym teacher, over a half-pint of Record at the nearby cafe Le Flash. \u201cIn a month, there will be 300 more who show up.\u201d\nMr. de Villars\u2019s is a common refrain here. But he added, \u201cSomeone who comes to France to work, and then to bring his family later, that doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\nSuch was the case for Mr. Marega, the Malian immigrant. He tells his story to family and friends, a warning to those who dream of France, as he once did, as a welcoming, easy-money paradise. But they cannot be deterred, he said.\n\u201cThey think we have a beautiful life here, with everything we need. Even if we tell them they mustn\u2019t come, they don\u2019t believe us.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/world/europe/11illegal.html", "title": "In Paris Without Papers, and Seeking Visibility", "author": "SCOTT SAYARE"}
{"date": "Thu, 12 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MADRID \u2014 The letter released Thursday in which Pope Benedict XVI admitted that the Vatican had made \u201cmistakes\u201d in handling the case of a Holocaust-denying bishop was unprecedented in its directness, its humanity and its acknowledgment of papal fallibility.\nBut it also contained two sentences unique in the annals of church history.\n\u201cI have been told that consulting the information available on the Internet would have made it possible to perceive the problem early on,\u201d Benedict wrote. \u201cI have learned the lesson that in the future in the Holy See we will have to pay greater attention to that source of news.\u201d\nIn other words: \u201cNote to the Roman Curia: try Google.\u201d\nThe Vatican, a 2,000-year-old monarchy built on the ruins of the Roman Empire and run by octogenarians, has officially recognized the demands of the 24-hour news cycle, not a 24-century one.\nIn his disarmingly human letter, Benedict acknowledged the \u201cavalanche of protests\u201d elicited after he revoked the excommunication of four schismatic bishops in January, including Richard Williamson, who in a television interview broadcast a few days earlier \u2014 and widely available online \u2014 had denied the existence of the Nazi gas chambers.\nIn the ensuing weeks, the pope said he had not been aware of Bishop Williamson\u2019s views at the time he revoked the excommunication, and he repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism.\nBut the criticism did not stop, as Catholics and Jews alike questioned the pope\u2019s moral authority.\nThe pope said in the letter that he was \u201csaddened\u201d that even Catholics \u201cthought they had to attack me with open hostility,\u201d and he thanked \u201cour Jewish friends, who quickly helped to clear up the misunderstanding and to restore the atmosphere of friendship and trust.\u201d\nBenedict met with a delegation of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel at the Vatican on Thursday and is expected to make his first papal visit to the Holy Land in May.\nSpeaking to reporters at the Vatican on Thursday, the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Benedict had taken the criticism to heart. \u201cHe demonstrates that he was touched and that he listened to what was said, even on the Internet,\u201d Father Lombardi said.\nIn a column last week, John L. Allen Jr. of The National Catholic Reporter noted that Benedict, a master at the question-and-answer format, recently responded to a question about whether clerics needed more real-world experience by saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t live on the moon.\u201d\nIn his letter, the pope also defended his decision to revoke the excommunications of the bishops, who belong to the ultraconservative Society of St. Pius X, founded in opposition to the liberalizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council of the mid-1960s.\nThey had been excommunicated by Pope John Paul II in 1988 after being consecrated without a papal mandate.\n\u201cThat the quiet gesture of extending a hand gave rise to a huge uproar, and thus became exactly the opposite of a gesture of reconciliation, is a fact which we must accept,\u201d Benedict wrote.\n\u201cBut I ask now: Was it, and is it, truly wrong in this case to meet halfway the brother who \u2018has something against you\u2019 and to seek reconciliation?\u201d he added, citing Scripture.\nHe also said that the group must accept the teachings of Vatican II. \u201cThe church\u2019s teaching authority cannot be frozen in the year 1962 \u2014 this must be quite clear to the Society,\u201d he wrote.\nOn Thursday, the Society of St. Pius X said it was ready to begin the doctrinal debates necessary for its return to full communion with the church. It conveyed the news in an e-mail message, in Latin, which instructed recipients \u201cIte ed vide,\u201d or go and look, at its Web site, of course.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/world/europe/13pope.html", "title": "Pope Admits Online News Can Provide Infallible Aid", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}

Then Fidel Castro, the former Cuban leader, accused Mr. Calder\u00f3n\u2019s government of having intentionally put off disclosing the flu epidemic so as not to interfere with President Obama\u2019s visit to Mexico.\nIn an effort to smooth things over on Friday, Patricia Espinoza, Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, met with her Cuban counterpart, Bruno Rodriguez, in Havana and invoked the historic connections between the countries. Mexico was the only country in Latin America that maintained diplomatic, political and economic ties with Cuba immediately after the 1959 revolution, prompting Ms. Espinoza to say, \u201cWe ought to make sure that our government relations correspond with that history.\u201d\nMr. Calder\u00f3n had planned to visit the island this year but he called off his trip after the hubbub over the flu. His visit was supposed to have been the beginning of a new era of cooperation between countries that have found their relations frayed.\nMr. Calder\u00f3n\u2019s predecessor, Vicente Fox, clashed openly with Fidel Castro\u2019s government, criticizing his human rights record and, in one famous episode in 2002, asking Mr. Castro to cut short his visit at a United Nations development summit meeting in Mexico in order not to \u201dcomplicate\u201d Mexico\u2019s relationship with the United States.\nMr. Castro, who considered Mexico too closely aligned with Washington, was so enraged that he released a tape of his private conversation with Mr. Fox.\nMs. Espinoza arrived in Cuba on Thursday, which was United Nations Human Rights Day. As is typical, government supporters broke up various demonstrations in Havana.

{"date": "Thu, 16 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "VLORE, Albania \u2014 It was only after her trafficker sealed her mouth with electrical tape, drugged her and threatened to kill her family that the childlike woman, now 27, says she realized that the man she had planned to marry had seduced her with a terrible lie.\nHer journey at age 18 from an Albanian village to a London brothel, where she said she spent five years working as a prostitute, began with a gold engagement ring, the promise of a better life abroad and \u2014 like many before her \u2014 a speedboat trip to Italy under the cover of night.\nSo many women, men and children had been trafficked abroad to work as prostitutes, forced laborers or beggars that the Albanian government three years ago barred all Albanian citizens from using speedboats, the favored transportation used by traffickers to get people out of the country.\nThis drastic measure, coupled with stricter border controls and revenge killings of traffickers by victims\u2019 families, had a significant effect, reducing trafficking by more than half and all but ending Albania\u2019s role as a major transit point for people trafficked to Western Europe from eastern and southern parts of the Continent, say experts who follow trafficking.\nBut the ban prompted loud protests from fishermen and people in the tourism industry, and in May it was reversed. Law enforcement and human rights officials are concerned that as a result, human trafficking may explode anew \u2014 at an especially difficult time.\nThe financial crisis, many experts said, could increase human trafficking around the world. A United States State Department report in June warned of the potential risk, saying that the crisis is causing \u201ca shrinking demand for labor and a growing supply of workers willing to take ever greater risks for economic opportunities.\u201d\nIn the case of Albania, a poor, southern Balkan country that joined NATO in April and seeks to join the European Union, the government\u2019s ability to fight trafficking is viewed as a critical test.\nFor victims like the woman from the small village, ensnared by the false promises of her trafficker, that fight is a matter of survival.\n\u201cI was in love with him, I dreamed of living my life with him, but it was all a big lie,\u201d she said in a recent interview at a shelter for trafficking victims. \u201cI wanted to run away, but in the eyes of the law, I was a prostitute with fake documents. Where was I to go?\u201d\nShe said the man who abducted her had gained her trust over months, then locked her in a room and took her passport and cellphone. She said he beat her and cut her with a penknife, a warning of what he would do if she tried to escape. She said she was forced to be a prostitute in London and in Antwerp, Belgium. To cover their tracks, the man\u2019s family had called her parents and said that the couple had moved to neighboring Kosovo.\nThe woman would not provide her name for fear of retribution from the trafficker, making it impossible to corroborate her story with the police report she said she had filed against the man. But the coordinator and director of the shelter where she is staying have reviewed the details of her case and vouched for her credibility.\nAt the height of the trafficking, experts estimate, thousands of women, men and children were taken to nearby Greece and Italy and elsewhere for sexual exploitation or forced labor.\nThe United Nations estimates that 12.3 million people globally are employed in sexual servitude or forced labor. Many are lured by fake engagements, real marriages or false job offers. In some cases, victims have been sold by their families. Others go voluntarily.\nEven with the speedboat ban last year, the State Department said in its June report that in 2008, Albania did not comply with \u201cthe minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking,\u201d although it made \u201csignificant efforts to do so.\u201d The report said corruption remained pervasive.\nIn June 2007, the Ministry of Interior arrested 12 police officers accused of human trafficking in three cases, including six officers with direct responsibility for anti-trafficking enforcement.\nAlbanian law enforcement officials say that help from other countries in getting evidence to convict traffickers is often lacking. Iva Zajmi, the anti-trafficking coordinator at the Ministry of Interior, stressed that as a result of legal or tolerated prostitution in countries like Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, many trafficked women were not identified as victims in those countries.\n\u201cThe legalization of prostitution has created a wall behind which traffickers can hide and repress victims,\u201d she said.\nTrafficking took root in Albania in 1991, in the aftermath of the fall of Communism, and for nearly 10 years, traffickers worked with impunity in the absence of trafficking laws. The problem peaked in 1997 as a financial pyramid scheme shook Albania and pushed the country to the brink of civil war.\n\u201cAlbanians were selling their sisters for money,\u201d said Ilir Yzeiri, an Albanian writer who made a documentary on human trafficking.\nIn 2004, the government created courts to try trafficking cases and passed tough trafficking laws, including prison sentences of up to 15 years for traffickers.\nBut human rights experts say prosecutions are too rare, partly because many victims are afraid to testify. Last year, 22 trafficking cases were prosecuted, according to the State Department report, fewer than half the number prosecuted in 2007.\nBrikena Puka, the executive director of Vatra, an outreach group that has helped trafficking victims, said prosecutions were scarce partly because many victims were being tried for prostitution. In some cases, women are jailed after having been deported from other countries.\n\u201cTrafficked women are being victimized twice,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst by the traffickers, then by the Albanian justice system.\u201d\nEven if they want to press charges, trafficked women who were interviewed say it is extremely difficult to escape from their captors, who are part of an organized international network.\nThe trafficking victim who shared her tale recalled that her trafficker had contacts in each city they visited. She said the trafficker also employed a forger, who provided fake documents.\nShe thought she would finally be freed when her trafficker was arrested in London in 2006 and deported to Albania. Instead, she said, his brothers and their wives, who were in London, put her back to work in the sex trade. She said at times she would make more than 1,000 euros daily, about $1,400, but was never allowed to keep it.\nWithin weeks, she said, she called the British police, who soon afterward deported her to Albania, where she filed a complaint with Albanian police accusing the trafficker of abuse.\nShe said that when she finally told her family, they rejected her. Within weeks, she said, she was again abducted by her trafficker, who had been released. He threatened to kill her if she did not retract her statement to the police, she said, so she told the police she had \u201clied because of jealousy.\u201d\nThe coordinator of the shelter where she is staying said the woman\u2019s original statement of her story was so detailed \u2014 and she showed so many signs of physical and psychological abuse \u2014 that the police rejected her retraction. She was referred to the shelter, which encouraged her to file formal charges against the trafficker. She did, and the man was jailed for one month before being released a second time, said the coordinator, who requested anonymity because of security concerns.\nThe former prostitute no longer faces the daily terror of her trafficker, but she is forced to live under constant police surveillance in the maximum security shelter, which she has not left in three years. She spends her time watching television and is learning to be a hairdresser at the shelter\u2019s makeshift salon.\n\u201cYou expect your own country to protect its citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cYou expect the laws not to make a victim into a criminal. Outside Albania, I was on my own, but here I am in my own country, and I am still being abused.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/world/europe/17albania.html", "title": "On Speedboats, Albania\u2019s Sex Trade Could Flare", "author": "DAN BILEFSKY"}
{"date": "Sat, 25 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 This sprawling capital was on edge Saturday as jittery residents ventured out wearing surgical masks and President Felipe Calder\u00f3n published an order that would give his government emergency powers to address a deadly flu outbreak, including isolating those who have contracted the virus, inspecting the homes of affected people and ordering the cancellation of public events.\nWhite-coated health care workers fanned out across the international airport here to look for ailing passengers, and thousands of callers fearful they might have contracted the rare swine flu flooded government health hot lines. Health officials also began notifying restaurants, bars and nightclubs throughout the city that they should close.\nOf those Mexicans who did go out in public, many took the advice of the authorities and donned the masks, which are known here as tapabocas, or cover-your-mouths, and were being handed out by soldiers and health workers at subway stops and on street corners.\n\u201cMy government will not delay one minute to take all the necessary measures to deal with this epidemic,\u201d Mr. Calder\u00f3n said in Oaxaca State during the opening of a new hospital, which he said would set aside an area for anyone who might be affected by the new swine flu strain that has already killed as many as 81 people in Mexico and sickened more than 1,300 others.\nMr. Calder\u00f3n pointed out that he and the other officials who attended the ceremony intentionally did not greet each other with handshakes or kisses on the cheek, which health officials have urged Mexicans to avoid.\nAt a news conference Saturday night to address the crisis, Mexico\u2019s health minister, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel C\u00f3rdova, said 20 of the 81 reported deaths were confirmed to have been caused by swine flu, while the rest are being studied. Most of the cases of illness were reported in the center of the country, but there were other cases in pockets to the north and south.\nThe government also announced at the news conference that schools in and around the capital that serve millions of students would remain closed until May 6.\nWith 20 million people packed together tight, Mexico City typically bursts forth on the weekends into parks, playgrounds, cultural centers and sidewalk cafes. But things were quieter than usual on Saturday.\nThe government encouraged people to stay home by canceling concerts, closing museums and banning spectators from two big soccer matches on Sunday that will be played in front of television cameras, but no live crowd.\nAt street corners on Saturday, even many of the jugglers, dancers and musicians who eke out a living collecting spare change when the traffic lights turn red were wearing bright blue surgical masks.\nThe newspaper Reforma reported that President Obama, who recently visited Mexico, was escorted around Mexico City\u2019s national anthropology museum on April 16 by Felipe Solis, an archaeologist who died the next day from flu-like symptoms. But Dr. C\u00f3rdova said that it does not appear that Mr. Solis died of influenza.\nWhite House officials said Saturday that they were aware of the news reports in Mexico but that there was no reason to be concerned about Mr. Obama\u2019s health, that he had no symptoms and that his medical staff had recommended he not be tested.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said Saturday that it had sent a team of experts to Mexico to assist with the investigation of the outbreak, which has already been reported in Texas and California and possibly in New York, raising fears that it could spread into a global pandemic.\nThe possible New York cases were reported at a Queens high school, where eight students tested positive for a type of influenza that health officials suspect could be the new swine flu. Some of the school\u2019s students had traveled to Mexico recently.\nStill, the World Health Organization, which held a meeting on Saturday to discuss the outbreak, chose not to raise the level of global pandemic flu alert, which has been at a Level 3 because of the avian flu.\nEpidemiologists want to know exactly when the first cases occurred in Mexico. Mexican health officials said they first noticed a huge spike in flu cases in late March. In mid-April, they began noticing that otherwise healthy people were dying from the virus. But it was only on Thursday night that officials first sounded an alarm to the population by closing schools, after United States health officials announced a possible swine flu outbreak.\nBy issuing the emergency decree Saturday, Mr. Calder\u00f3n may have been trying to head off criticism that his government had been too slow to act. He had earlier called in the army to distribute four million masks throughout the capital and its suburbs.\nLt. Raymundo Morales Merla, who stood outside a military transport truck parked outside a downtown subway station on Saturday, led a group of 27 soldiers who had arrived at 7 a.m. to hand out as many masks as they could.\nThe scene at the airport was alarming, with doctors stationed at the entrances to answer questions and to keep an eye out for obviously sick people. Regular public address announcements in English and Spanish warned travelers that anyone exhibiting any symptoms should cancel their flight and immediately seek medical attention.\nEven Sunday Mass will probably be affected. The Roman Catholic Church gave worshipers the option to listen to Masses on the radio and told priests who decided to hold services to be brief and put Communion wafers in worshipers\u2019 hands instead of their mouths.\nAxel de la Macorra, 46, a physics professor at National Autonomous University of Mexico, said he became worried when he learned recently that a 31-year-man who played at a tennis club he once belonged to had suddenly died. \u201cHe got sick at the beginning of April and two weeks later, he was dead,\u201d said Mr. de la Macorra, who was weighing whether to attend a First Communion with 200 guests on Saturday.\n\u201cMy mother told me to wear it so I did,\u201d said Noel Ledezma, 29, who had his mask pulled down so he could sip a coffee and eat a muffin as he walked to work. \u201cWho knows who will be next.\u201d\nSarahe Gomez, who was selling jewelry at a mall in the upscale Polanco neighborhood, spoke through a mask to the few customers who visited her kiosk. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of all these people and one of them could have it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe virus could be anywhere. It could be right here.\u201d\nShe then took a half step back.\n\u201cThis is no joke,\u201d said Servando Peneda, 42, a lawyer who ventured out to pay a bill, but left his two sons home. \u201cThere\u2019s 20 million of us in this city and I\u2019d say half of us have these masks on today.

But the ship\u2019s proximity to Myanmar, a North Korean ally, and the fact that it had no apparent reason to be in the area raised suspicions.\nThe coast guard intercepted the ship after chasing it for six hours, and detained 39 North Korean crew members.\nAfter two days of searching and of questioning the crew, India\u2019s Navy and Coast Guard handed the ship over to police and intelligence services, having found no evidence of illegal cargo, according to the Press Trust of India.\nAshok Chand, a senior police officer in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, told Reuters that further tests were being conducted.\nBut it remains a mystery why the ship was in Indian waters at all.\nIndia has watched warily for signs that North Korea is helping Myanmar build a nuclear reactor.\nAdm.

{"date": "Sun, 30 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 A suicide bomber blew himself up on Sunday at a central police station in the largest town in the Swat Valley, killing at least 15 police recruits and shattering the semblance of normality that the army had tried to enforce in the troubled area.\nA group of new police officers, recently hired to patrol local communities, was performing training exercises when the suicide bomber struck at the police station in Mingora, the information minister for the North-West Frontier Province, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said.\nAt least 30 Taliban militants were killed by Pakistani security forces in overnight battles across the northwestern Swat Valley after the bombing, the military said Monday in a statement quoted by The Associated Press. The attack came as the Pakistani Army has asserted that it now controls most of the Swat Valley and that the Taliban militants who held sway there for nearly two years have been beaten back to only a few enclaves. On Saturday, the army said it had destroyed a suicide bomber training camp in Charbagh, six miles from Mingora, strafing it with helicopter gunships.\nThe bomber disguised himself as a police recruit and walked into the walled compound, officials said.\nThe police station was hit so many times by the Taliban in the previous two years that the regular police of Mingora had abandoned the compound and handed it over for training exercises, local officials said.\nThe medical superintendent of the main hospital in Mingora, Lal Noor Afridi, said 13 officers had died at the police station and two more had died at the hospital. About 20 recruits were reported to have been wounded.\nMuhammed Qasim, 28, a college student, said he had been preparing to drive to Peshawar when the bomb went off. \u201cI was standing outside and heard a huge blast, followed by firing,\u201d Mr. Qasim said. Soldiers fired their weapons to signal that the military was imposing an immediate curfew on the town, he said.\nThe brazen nature of the attack right in the center of Mingora showed the high cost of the army\u2019s failure to capture or kill top Taliban commanders and strategists. The attack was the fourth by militants against security forces in a month, and it was by far the most devastating.\nMaking community police recruits the targets of the attack appeared to be a carefully considered strategic choice, striking at one of the main elements of the government\u2019s plan to provide improved security against militants.\nThe new police officers were vetted and hired last month under a program introduced by the provincial government to provide local law enforcement officers who could identify militants and protect the public.\nThe new community officers are paid the equivalent of $120 a month, more than regular police officers receive, but do not get a pension or other benefits.\nThe killing of so many recruits at the beginning of the program will discourage good candidates in the future, said Sher Mohammed, a lawyer from Mingora.\nThe attack may also have been retaliation against the military for what local residents and human rights advocates say have been extrajudicial killings by the military of suspected militants.\nThe Pakistani Army has denied that soldiers have arrested such suspects, killed them and left their bodies in the streets.\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has called the accusations credible and said it had gathered \u201ccomplaints of reprisal attacks by the security forces during the operation in Swat.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/world/asia/31pstan.html", "title": "Suicide Bomber Kills 15 Police Recruits in Pakistan\u2019s Swat Valley", "author": "JANE PERLEZ and PIR ZUBAIR SHAH"}

{"date": "Sun, 08 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 A mob attack on women drinking in a college-town bar has set off the latest battle in the great Indian culture wars, uncorking a national debate over moral policing and its political repercussions, and laying bare the limits of freedom for young Indian women.\nThe latest Old versus New India hubbub began one Saturday last month when an obscure Hindu organization, which calls itself Sri Ram Sena, or the Army of Ram, a Hindu god, attacked several women at a bar in the southern Indian college town of Mangalore and accused them of being un-Indian for being out drinking and dancing with men.\nThe Sena had television news crews in tow, so its attack on the women at the bar, called Amnesia \u2014 the Lounge, was swiftly broadcast nationwide.\nThe video, broadcast repeatedly since then, showed some women being pushed to the ground and others cowering and shielding their faces. It was unclear whether they were trying to protect themselves from their assailants\u2019 fists or the television cameras or both. None of them have come out publicly since then, and it is unclear whether anyone was seriously hurt.\nEventually, more than 10 members of the Sena were arrested, only to be released on bail in a week. Since then, they have promised to campaign against Valentine\u2019s Day, which they criticized as a foreign conspiracy to dilute Indian culture, and they said they did not disapprove of men drinking at bars.\nThe conflict surrounding so-called pub culture in India set off nearly two weeks of shouting matches on television talk shows and editorial pages. Politicians have also jumped into the fray.\nAt first, some lawmakers with the governing Congress Party seized on the Mangalore attack to denounce their political rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., for its loose affiliations with a variety of Hindu radical groups. But the B.J.P., which governs the state of Karnataka, where Mangalore is located, instantly condemned the violence. And soon enough, others allied with the governing coalition, while condemning violence, joined the finger-wagging.\nOne official denounced shopping malls, too, calling them havens of hand-holding. The health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, promised a national alcohol law to curb drinking, without which, he told reporters, \u201cIndia will not progress.\u201d\nB. P. Singhal, a former member of Parliament who was with the B.J.P. and who has been making the rounds of television talk shows, rued that men acted irresponsibly in the company of women at bars. A Sena leader appeared on television to say his group was stepping in to enforce morality because the government had failed.\nThe women and child development minister, Renuka Chowdhury, has been one of the few politicians to openly criticize the Sena, calling its methods \u201cTalibanization.\u201d\nThe debate comes as a new generation of Indian women steps out of the home for work or play in a rapidly expanding economy and finds itself having to negotiate old social boundaries, harassment and, sometimes, outright violence. New Delhi is among the most notorious for this; among big cities in India, it has logged the highest number of reported cases of rape and molestation for the last decade.\nOn a recent night at Cafe Morrison, a deafening rock \u2019n\u2019 roll bar, the national stir over pub culture inspired irritation, dismay and soul-searching.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pathetic,\u201d said Kirat Rawel, 23, a college student who was spending the evening at the bar here in the capital with her younger sister, Nimrit, 21. \u201cIt is basically for the vote bank. It has nothing to do with culture.\u201d\nThe sisters said their parents, who live in a small town more than five hours from here by car, had no problem with their going to a bar and having a drink.\nThe sisters also know that even in New Delhi, one of India\u2019s most seemingly modern cities, they are not immune to attacks like the one in Mangalore and that they are surrounded by other Indians who, in their hearts, do not approve of young women who go out at night and drink in the company of strangers. They suspected that there was quiet approval among many Indians of the Sena mob that assaulted the women in Mangalore.\n\u201cUrban India may criticize it,\u201d Kirat Rawel said, \u201cbut there is a certain section of India that believes in it.\u201d\nBy 10 p.m., most of the women, who were a minority at Cafe Morrison anyway, had begun to clear out. The Rawel sisters, like many single women in this city, said they worried most about how to get home safely.\nSanah Galgotia, 21, nursed a beer and recalled this story: She had been walking home around midafternoon recently when a car full of men slowly followed behind. Furious, she turned around, shouted and banged on the car window, only to have the driver try to run her over. She escaped and ran home. When she got there and recounted her ordeal, her mother asked why she had pursued the aggressors.\nTo Ms. Galgotia, the episode demonstrated the \u201cschizophrenic\u201d attitude of Indian women \u2014 alternating between being assertive and subservient and then judging others for tilting one way or the other. She is guilty of it, too, she said. When she sees a woman who smokes in public, she sizes her up instantly.\n\u201cIn India, no matter how modern you are, you\u2019re still in this schizophrenic nonmodern thing,\u201d she said, straining to be heard as the D.J. blasted Pearl Jam.\nShe looked around and wondered aloud whether she and her friends were simply \u201ctrying to ape the West.\u201d That set off an argument.\nHer friend Murphy John, 21, shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a jacket, not a dhoti-kurta,\u201d he said, referring to the traditional Indian draped pantaloon and tunic, \u201cbecause I like wearing a jacket. It\u2019s globalization.\u201d\n\u201cWe are globalized in our lifestyle,\u201d Ms. Galgotia responded, \u201cbut very Indian at heart. I know I am.\u201d\nAnother friend at the table, Sandesh Moses, 22, said he thought the Sena had probably accomplished its goal.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want women to go out,\u201d he said. \u201cI can guarantee a lot of people will be supporting them.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/world/asia/09india.html", "title": "Attack on Women at an Indian Bar Intensifies a Clash of Cultures", "author": "SOMINI SENGUPTA"}

In all, soldiers found more than 101 tons of narcotics, including heroin, poppy seeds, opium and hashish. Large amounts of heroin processing materials were also confiscated, the military said.\nHeroin is a major source of income for the Taliban in Afghanistan, and the American military has said it would be a major focus of future operations as more troops are moved into Afghanistan this summer under President Obama\u2019s plan.\nThe drugs were taken in a central market area in the town. A battle ensued in which, according to the American military, 60 insurgents were killed. An American military spokesman said the allies met a surprising level of resistance, fighting the militants for four days in gun battles and by aerial strikes.\nThe military said that commandos also found bomb-making materials, including 30 tons of ammonium nitrate, pressure plate triggers, military grade explosives and ammunition vests.\nThe spokesman for the American forces, Col.

The men\u2019s accusations offered a dark window into the chaos and bloodshed that swept Iraq during the worst period of sectarianism in 2006 and 2007.\nMr. Daini denied any wrongdoing, saying that the charges were politically motivated and that the confessions should be examined to see if they were obtained lawfully.\n\u201cThose guys were my bodyguards,\u201d he said in a telephone interview on Sunday after watching the news conference on television. \u201cThey were arrested two weeks ago and they were pressed to accuse me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that Iran is behind this operation.\u201d\nMr. Daini, who was elected to Parliament in 2005 and is one of a small number of Sunni lawmakers, has frequently accused the majority Shiite government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of being sectarian and of doing the bidding of Iran.\nMr. Daini\u2019s guards described launching mortar shells into the Green Zone, kidnapping people for ransom, executing possible rivals and helping to plan car bombs, all, they said, at Mr. Daini\u2019s direction.\nRiyadh Ibrahim, Mr. Daini\u2019s nephew and former bodyguard, said he drove a suicide bomber who attacked Parliament in 2007 into the Green Zone, and that the bomber used Mr. Daini\u2019s badge to get past security. After entering the Parliament building, Mr. Ibrahim said, the bomber was given an explosive belt by a cafeteria worker. He said the attack, which killed eight people, was masterminded by Mr. Daini.\nSome of the crimes alleged by Mr. Ibrahim and another bodyguard, Alla Khairalla, were particularly gruesome.\nIn 2007, after 11 guests that Mr. Daini had over to his home in Baghdad were killed on their way home, Mr. Ibrahim said, Mr. Daini ordered him to get revenge.\n\u201cHe got very angry and demanded that we find 10 people for each one that was killed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found about 110 people and gathered them in the area of Tuwella,\u201d in Diyala Province, he said. \u201cThey were all buried alive.\u201d\nBoth men recounted an episode around the same time in which they were told to go to the gold district in Mansour, kill the Christian shop owners and take their merchandise.\nMr. Khairalla said that they brought the stolen gold to Mr. Daini in his office.\nBrig. Gen. Qassim Atta, the Iraqi military spokesman who announced the charges at the news conference, said that the legal procedures necessary to lift Mr. Daini\u2019s immunity, which he is granted as a member of Parliament, had begun.\nMuhsen al-Saadon, a member of Parliament whose committee would have to sign off on any decision to lift immunity, said he had not yet received any official request to take action. A special judiciary council would have to first submit a complaint, he said. If Mr. Daini\u2019s immunity is lifted, he could face arrest and then possible trial.\nIn other developments in Iraq, Maj. Gen. David Perkins said at a briefing on Sunday that violent attacks in January were at their lowest levels since August 2003. On Friday, he said, not a single Iraqi civilian had been killed.\nThe violence has decreased even as American troops have been pulling out of their bases in cities across Iraq. \u201cThere is no doubt we will be out of the cities by June,\u201d he said.\nHowever, there remain pockets of resistance where American and Iraqi forces still find themselves under assault.\nBrig. Gen. Said Ahmed Abdullah, an Iraqi commander, said in an interview on Sunday that Iraqi and American forces began a new operation on Friday aimed at rooting out militants in Nineveh Province. He said that 84 people had been arrested and that he expected the crackdown to last three months.\nMr. Maliki, meanwhile, has been trying to build relationships with nations other than the United States. He will make his first trip to Russia in April to meet with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, his office said Sunday. Mr. Maliki has hosted France\u2019s president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in Baghdad recently.\nThere were also indications that Mr. Maliki would form an alliance with the slate of politicians backed by the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr.\nAmir Tahir al-Kenani, the general secretary of the Free People list backed by supporters of Mr. Sadr, said the slate would most likely announce the alliance \u201cin the next few days.\u201d\nThe alliance could be significant because the Jan. 31 elections left no single party with a clear majority in most of Iraq\u2019s provinces.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/world/middleeast/23iraq.html", "title": "Iraqi Lawmaker Is Charged With Masterminding an Attack on Parliament", "author": "MARC SANTORA"}

{"date": "Fri, 31 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 A High Court ruling on Friday brought Britain an important step closer to extraditing a 43-year-old British computer hacker to the United States despite claims by the man\u2019s lawyers that he is a harmless eccentric with a form of autism, and not a cyberterrorist, as American prosecutors have asserted.\nThe man, Gary McKinnon, has admitted that he hacked into dozens of American military computers from his apartment in north London in 2001 and 2002, saying he was looking for information on U.F.O.\u2019s. The latest court ruling rejected his request for a judicial review of a government decision last year approving an American request for his extradition. The court order also rejected his bid to be tried in Britain.\nMr. McKinnon\u2019s lawyers have spent seven years in a revolving door of hearings and appeals, all unsuccessful. The new ruling leaves them 28 days to review the court\u2019s findings and consider other legal avenues, including a possible bid to Britain\u2019s new Supreme Court, which will sit next month for the first time. It will replace the Law Lords, for 150 years Britain\u2019s highest appeals court.\nBut judging from statements made by Mr. McKinnon\u2019s lawyers and relatives outside the court in London on Friday, their hopes now focus on political intervention.\nA group of 40 British lawmakers has written to President Obama, asking him to step in and \u201cbring this shameful episode to an end\u201d on humanitarian grounds.\nProspects for relief from the British government seem meager, since the British home secretary, Alan Johnson, responded to the new court ruling with a statement reiterating his backing for the extradition.\n\u201cMr. McKinnon is accused of serious crimes, and the United States has a lawful right to seek his extradition,\u201d he said.\nMr. McKinnon acknowledges hacking into 97 computers belonging to the United States Defense Department, Navy, Army and Air Force, and NASA in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks. His lawyers and family have said that his actions were influenced by the fact that he has Asperger\u2019s syndrome, a form of autism.\nBut lawyers in Britain seeking his extradition have said his actions were not as benign as he has claimed, and that the diagnosis was made long after the computer hacking occurred, at a time when the legal case was well advanced. Describing him as the most prolific and damaging computer hacker in the history of the United States military, they have maintained that he intended to damage American security by acts of \u201cintimidation and coercion,\u201d that he stole more than 1,000 passwords from high-security computer networks and that it cost $700,000 to repair the damage he caused.\nThey have also said that Mr. McKinnon left a message in one Pentagon computer making clear that his actions were politically motivated. In court, they represented the message as having said: \u201cU.S. foreign policy is akin to government-sponsored terrorism. I will continue to disrupt at the highest possible level.\u201d\nMr. McKinnon faces eight counts of computer fraud in New Jersey and Virginia, where some of the computer networks he compromised were located. His lawyers and family say he could face a prison sentence of up to 60 years, though American prosecutors have said that he would be likely to get no more than a 10-year sentence. In legal submissions in Britain, the lawyers have argued that Mr. McKinnon should be tried in Britain, where the potential penalties are far less severe, and that he might commit suicide if forced to stand trial in the United States.\nHis mother, Janis Sharp, said Friday that she feared for his life if he was extradited. \u201cGary would not survive, and I would never see my son again,\u201d she said. \u201cAll to oblige the Americans?\u201d\nBritain\u2019s National Autistic Society said it was extremely disappointed. \u201cWe are angry that Gary is in this position,\u201d Amanda Batten, the society\u2019s policy chief, said. \u201cWe will continue campaigning and do all we can to support Gary to stay in the U.K.\u201d\nThe case has prompted an increasingly acrimonious debate over the fairness of a new extradition treaty reached by Britain and the United States in 2003, as part of their efforts to streamline procedures for dealing with terrorism threats.\nMr. McKinnon\u2019s supporters say the treaty is one-sided, making it far easier for the United States to extradite people from Britain than the reverse. Legal experts say that the treaty requires the United States to show British courts only that charges have been properly filed against an individual whose extradition it seeks, while Britain has to produce evidence in American courts to support the case it intends to bring against someone it wants returned to Britain.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/world/europe/01britain.html", "title": "Hacker\u2019s Extradition to U.S. More Likely", "author": "JOHN F.

The announcement on Saturday, which said a man with the initials M. Z. would be put to death, appears to confirm that sentence and report two others.\nAccording to the report Saturday, two of the protesters were members of the Kingdom Assembly of Iran, a group that wants to restore the monarchy.\nThe third, identified as N. A., was said to be a member of People\u2019s Mujahedeen of Iran, an exile group that Iran says works to overthrow the government.\nThe news of death sentences sparked immediate condemnation from international human rights groups. In the weeks after the election, millions of Iranians marched in the streets of Tehran, charging that Mr. Ahmadinejad stole the race. At least 30 people were killed in a government crackdown that quelled the protests but failed to end the simmering discontent.\n\u201cZamani\u2019s trial was a mockery of justice,\u201d the executive director of Amnesty International USA, Larry Cox, said in a statement. \u201cTo impose the death sentence is beyond deplorable. Iran should immediately rescind this sentence.\u201d\nThe ISNA report, without giving details, said the court also sentenced 18 other protesters. That raised concerns about the hundreds of journalists, former government officials, academics and protesters still held in prison, many incommunicado, said the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, a group based in the United States.\nThere have been many charges of protesters\u2019 being tortured while in prison, and the government has agreed that some prisoners were abused, although it has continued to dispute accusations that some were raped and sodomized.\n\u201cIranian authorities have released little or no information about many of the approximately 400 persons who remain detained,\u201d the human rights campaign said in a statement, adding that Iran was \u201cviolating international standards for due process and raising deep concerns about their health and safety.\u201d\nAmong those who remain in detention are Maziar Bahari, a filmmaker and reporter for Newsweek, and Shapur Kazemi, the brother-in-law of Mir Hussein Moussavi, who the opposition claims won the election. Mr. Kazemi, 62, is a respected telecommunications engineer and is known for his activities in technical and economic fields rather than for political activism.\nOthers who are still being held include the former vice president, Mohammad Ali Abtahi; Muhammad Atrianfar, a publisher and confidant of the former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani; Mostafa Tajzadeh, a deputy interior minister in the reformist government of the former president Mohammad Khatami; Saeed Leylaz, an economist and former government official; and the journalist Isa Saharkhiz, who according to Iranian news reports suffered broken ribs during interrogation.\nStudent activists being held include Abdullah Momeni, a former spokesman for the student group Iran Alumni Association, who confessed in court.

{"date": "Wed, 26 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 The Supreme Court of Argentina opened a path this week to decriminalizing the private consumption of illicit drugs, becoming the latest Latin American country to reject punitive policies toward drug use.\nThe unanimous decision by the Argentine court on Tuesday, which declared unconstitutional the arrest of five youths for possession of a few marijuana cigarettes in 2006, came just days after Mexico\u2019s Congress voted to end the practice of prosecuting people found to be carrying small amounts of illicit drugs, including marijuana.\nBrazil, which has some of the stiffest sentences in the region for drug traffickers, essentially decriminalized drug consumption in 2006 when it eliminated prison sentences for users in favor of treatment and community service.\nThe new laws and court decisions in the region reflect an urgent desire to reject decades of American prescriptions for distinctly Latin American challenges. Countries in the region are seeking to counteract prison overcrowding, a rise in organized crime and rampant drug violence affecting all levels of society, but in particular the poor and the young.\nIn February, a commission led by three former Latin American presidents issued a scathing report that condemned Washington\u2019s \u201cwar on drugs\u201d as a failure and urged the region to adopt drug policies found in some European countries that focus more on treatment than punishment.\n\u201cThe global consensus on drug policy is cracking, and an increasing number of countries are agreeing that over-reliance on criminal justice as the \u2018solution\u2019 to the drug problem is not helpful at best, and is often harmful,\u201d said Kasia Malinowska-Sempruch, director of the Open Society Institute's Global Drug Policy Program, based in Warsaw, who advocates for treatment for users rather than prison time.\nIn Europe, the Netherlands and Switzerland have led the way in decriminalizing possession, and several other countries have followed suit.\nThe Argentine court decision is consistent with similar decisions by courts in Germany more than a decade ago and in Colombia in the late 1990s.\nLatin America is a source of much of the cocaine and marijuana that is distributed throughout North America and Europe. Latin American leaders are struggling with the need to crack down on violent drug traffickers while also trying to stem consumption. Punishing users in Latin America has led to overcrowded prisons and has done little, if anything, to curb overall consumption.\nIn Mexico, meanwhile, the laws against drug use contributed to another problem by fueling corruption among the police. The change in the law takes the discretion of whether to jail drug users away from police officers, who frequently collected bribes by threatening people with arrest.\nThe need to resolve the inherent contradictions led to the formation of the commission on drug use and democracy that issued its report in February. The commission, a 17-member group of journalists, academics and others, including three former presidents \u2014 C\u00e9sar Gaviria of Colombia, Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico and Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil \u2014 condemned the American-led \u201cwar on drugs\u201d of the past three decades as a \u201cfailed war.\u201d It urged countries to reject the \u201cU.S. prohibitionist policies.\u201d\nThe commission found that drug consumption continued to rise in Latin America while it was stabilizing in North America and Europe. The policy in parts of the European Union of treating drug use as a health problem and focusing on treatment, the report said, \u201chas proved more humane and efficient,\u201d although it said more needed to be done to curb demand in the main drug-consuming countries.\nMs. Malinowska-Sempruch said she believed that it was no coincidence that the Mexican legislature voted for a measure last week that was similar to one passed in 2006, but was rejected by the president at the time, Vicente Fox, under pressure from the United States. She said she believed that Latin American countries had been carefully watching the Obama administration and took some early support for the concept of a needle exchange for drug addicts as \u201ca much needed signal for those of us throughout the world who think that drug use is a public health matter.\u201d\n\u201cThe administration has left more space for people in Latin America to do what has been under discussion there for some time now,\u201d she said.\nEthan Nadelmann, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a New York-based group working to end the war on drugs, said the \u201cprohibitionist approach\u201d to drug control had \u201cwreaked havoc throughout the region, generating crime, violence and corruption on a scale that far exceeds what the United States experienced during alcohol prohibition in the 1920s.\u201d\nThe Argentine court decision will pave the way for the government of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner to submit a law to Argentina\u2019s Congress that is expected to be similar to the law Mexico\u2019s legislature voted on in April. Mrs. Kirchner has said she favors a less punitive approach to drug use.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s ruling, the Supreme Court in Argentina declared unanimously that the 2006 arrests for marijuana were unconstitutional under the concept of \u201cpersonal autonomy\u201d protected by the Constitution.\nCritics of the decision, including the Roman Catholic Church, said that the decision stretched the \u201cautonomy\u201d concept too far and that it could worsen a public health problem and overstretch the country\u2019s health infrastructure, which struggled badly recently in its response to swine flu.\nArgentina has a serious drug problem, but not especially with the use of marijuana. The country has one of the highest per-capita rates of cocaine use in the world and a growing problem with synthetic drugs like Ecstasy. Some parts of the country have also been afflicted by the rapid rise of \u201cpaco,\u201d a cheap and highly addictive drug that combines small amounts of cocaine residue with toxic chemicals.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/world/americas/27latin.html", "title": "Latin America Weighs Less Punitive Path to Curb Drug Use", "author": "ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO"}

The prison has become an international symbol of American excesses in the war against terrorism, and an increasingly frustrating problem for the White House.\nThe release of the men had been announced by the Justice Department, but the timing was kept a secret for security reasons until the detainees were safely in Palau, where they are expected to remain while seeking a permanent home elsewhere.\nWells Dixon, a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights who represents three of the men, said, \u201cPalau is courageous to offer our Uighur clients a temporary home. We are hopeful that other countries like Australia and Germany will resettle them permanently.\u201d\nIn a news release late Saturday, the Justice Department identified the men as Ahmad Tourson, Abdul Ghappar Abdul Rahman, Edham Mamet, Anwar Hassan, Dawut Abdurehim and Adel Noori. \u201cAs we near the completion of our review of detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, we will continue to work closely with the Department of State to implement transfer decisions,\u201d Matthew Olsen, executive director of the Guant\u00e1namo Review Task Force, said in the release.\nThe Uighurs, from western China, were taken into custody in 2001 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. They have long been determined by American authorities to pose no security threat, but they are regarded as terrorists by the Chinese government and have said that they fear persecution if they are returned there.\nLast month, a case involving 13 of the men reached the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to consider the issue of whether federal judges have the power to release into the United States detainees who are determined by authorities to pose no security threat.\nIn October 2008, a federal judge in the District of Columbia ordered the Uighurs released into the custody of their supporters in the United States, mainly in the Washington area. But an appeals court overturned that ruling in February, saying judges have no authority to override immigration laws to force the executive branch to release foreigners into the United States.\nIt is unclear whether the release will have any impact on the court. Lower-court rulings have tied the hands of judges considering similar challenges from other prisoners at the base in Cuba.\nTrial judges have granted habeas corpus petitions from more than two dozen detainees, of whom about 10 have been transferred to other countries. Four of the Uighurs were moved in June to Bermuda. None of them have entered the United States.\nLawyers for the Obama administration, like those for the Bush administration, have argued that the executive branch, not judges, has the authority to make decisions about whether to release detainees into the United States.\nThe possibility that any detainees might be moved to the United States to be set free, or even to be prosecuted, has provoked a storm of protest from members of Congress from both parties. Lawmakers barred the Obama administration from releasing any Guant\u00e1namo prisoners into the country. More recently, Congress kept in place the ban on releasing them but authorized transfers for prosecution in military or civilian courts.\nPresident Obama, in one of his first acts in office, ordered the prison closed by January 2010, but administration officials have said they are unlikely to meet that deadline, mainly because of the problems in relocating detainees.\nThe Uighurs were among nearly 100 detainees who had been cleared for transfers to other countries; so far the administration has moved 25 of them.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/world/asia/01uighurs.html", "title": "Uighurs Leave Guant\u00e1namo for Palau", "author": "DAVID JOHNSTON"}

The two men, who made the film for HBO with the co-producer Peter Kwong, said their visa applications were rejected late last week.\n\u201cWe are extremely disappointed that the Chinese government denied our request for visas and that we will not be permitted to discuss this film with a Chinese audience in Beijing,\u201d Mr. Alpert and Mr. O\u2019Neill said in a joint e-mail message. \u201cThe denial of our visas fits in with a pattern of what seems to be a complete commitment on the part of this Chinese government to crush any inquiry into the possibility of wrongful deaths during the earthquake in Sichuan.\u201d\nChen Cong, a vice consul in the press office of the Chinese Consulate in New York, declined to explain the rejection, saying that diplomatic organizations had \u201cthe right not to give a reason for why the visa was denied.\u201d\nMr. Alpert and Mr. O\u2019Neill have both won Emmy Awards and have worked together on highly praised documentaries, including \u201cBaghdad ER.\u201d The Sichuan documentary was shown on HBO in May, one year after the earthquake, and got positive reviews. The official Web site of the film is blocked in China.\nThe Chinese government has gone to great lengths to silence any mention of the collapsed schools and, according to an official count, the 5,335 children who died or remain missing. In the weeks after the earthquake, which left nearly 87,000 people dead or missing, parents took to the streets to demand official investigations into why so many school buildings had collapsed even though other buildings around them remained standing. The parents said shoddy construction and corruption were the obvious causes.\nLocal officials ordered security forces to detain the parents or tried to buy the silence of the parents with compensation money. Meanwhile, journalists who tried approaching the schools were stopped, and two rights advocates who pressed for official inquiries were detained. The two advocates, Huang Qi and Tan Zuoren, were put on trial last month.\nArtists trying to raise consciousness over the collapsed schools have been similarly harassed. The Chinese filmmaker Pan Jianlin was tracked by security officials after his documentary on the deaths, \u201cWho Killed Our Children?\u201d was shown last year at the Pusan International Film Festival in South Korea. Ai Weiwei, a prominent artist who often criticizes the Communist Party, had his Web site blocked after he tried to compile online a comprehensive tally of dead schoolchildren. He was temporarily detained in Sichuan last month when he tried to attend the trial of Mr. Tan.\nA person helping to organize the film festival in Beijing said the HBO documentary would be shown on Thursday even though the filmmakers would not be able to attend.

{"date": "Fri, 11 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "Eleven months into his presidency, a set of Obama principles, if not quite a doctrine, is beginning to emerge \u2014 a philosophy about when to use American military force, when to forsake it and when to threaten its use to back up diplomatic pressure.\nThe president\u2019s acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday explored what happens when the concept of \u201cjust and unjust wars\u201d intersects with the realities of commanding the only military that can act as the world\u2019s policeman of last resort. Just what does that speech suggest about how Mr. Obama will handle the hardest cases on his desk?\nThe speech came at an inflection point in Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency \u2014 a moment when diplomatic engagement is giving way to consideration of far tougher measures. Just a few weeks ago Mr. Obama\u2019s emissaries warned the Pakistani government that unless it gets serious about routing Al Qaeda and Afghan Taliban forces operating in its mountains and cities, he will.\nThere is the imminent decision about how to corral the world\u2019s powers into truly effective sanctions on Iran \u2014 with the unspoken reality that if the effort fails, Mr. Obama and his allies may have to choose between living with a nuclear-capable Iran or living with the blowback from any military or covert attack to set back its program.\nAnd there are the continuing humanitarian disasters where Mr. Obama told the Nobel committee \u201cforce can be justified\u201d to protect civilians. He seemed to be thinking of Sudan\u2019s Darfur region, Somalia, Rwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide and perhaps the long-running cases of North Korea\u2019s gulags and Myanmar\u2019s repression. But in each, the world has not wanted to risk outright military intervention, and few other levers of influence, from peacekeepers to sanctions, have proved effective.\nMr. Obama\u2019s evolving approach \u2014 it may draw from too many different foreign policy philosophies to qualify as a doctrine \u2014 lacks bumper-sticker simplicity. It is far more shaded than the 2002 Bush Doctrine of pre-emptive action against emerging threats: After the failure to discover unconventional weapons in Iraq, Mr. Bush\u2019s theory lost so much credibility that he stopped talking about what constituted an imminent or severe enough threat for America to act alone.\nNor does Mr. Obama\u2019s approach have the boundaries and well-understood rules of cold-war-style containment, which started with the Truman administration, became the justification for Vietnam and ultimately succeeded, many historians believe, with the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nAs one of Mr. Obama\u2019s national security strategists put it just after the announcement of the decision to add 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, \u201cwe live in messy times, which don\u2019t lend themselves to easy doctrines.\u201d\nBut by reaching back to the concept of \u201cjust war\u201d at the moment he was accepting a prize for peace, Mr. Obama was signaling that after nearly a year in office, his views about the need to resort to force at times have begun to harden. It was almost certainly not the speech that the Nobel committee expected to hear, nor the one Mr. Obama himself might have written six years ago. Then, as a state senator, he had used his opposition to the Iraq war to speak for the first time on issues of war and peace.\nThe main paragraph in Oslo acknowledged the lessons drawn from the philosophies of nonviolence preached by Mahatma Gandhi (who never won the Nobel Peace Prize) and Martin Luther King (who did, in 1964) and then made a decisive turn. As a head of state who must defend his country, Mr. Obama said, \u201cI cannot be guided by their examples alone.\u201d\n\u201cI face the world as it is,\u201d Mr. Obama declared, a phrase he later repeated to bolster his bona fides as a realist. \u201cFor make no mistake: Evil does exist in the world. A nonviolent movement could not have halted Hitler\u2019s armies. Negotiations cannot convince Al Qaeda\u2019s leaders to lay down their arms.\u201d\nThat juxtaposition of Hitler and Al Qaeda made it clear that Mr. Obama has no doubt that only force will work when it comes to dealing with the group that carried out the Sept. 11 attacks.\nPerhaps that explains a statistic that the White House has not advertised: Since Mr. Obama came to office, the Central Intelligence Agency has mounted more Predator drone strikes into Pakistan, mostly aimed at suspected Qaeda or Taliban havens, than during Mr. Bush\u2019s eight years in office. (Armed Predators were in short supply during the first years of Mr. Bush\u2019s presidency.)\nIn short, in Mr. Obama\u2019s world view, the war against Al Qaeda is the ultimate \u201cjust war,\u201d because it is directly linked to an act of aggression. Similarly he praised the first President Bush\u2019s decision to go to war against Iraq in 1991 for its invasion of Kuwait the previous year, because it \u201csent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression.\u201d\nIn Mr. Obama\u2019s second year in office, the hard part of this calculation will be how to prosecute such a war in Pakistan \u2014 the sovereign territory of an ally that, so far, has had neither the will nor the ability to take on Al Qaeda in its own territory. During a visit to Pakistan last month, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, told Pakistani officials that Mr. Obama would not view the border as a barrier if he was responding to strikes by Al Qaeda or the Taliban emanating from Pakistan \u2014 which occur almost daily. Yet on that issue, the president was silent in Oslo.\nIran is the other looming case. Mr. Obama made the argument in Oslo that his commitment to seeking a world without nuclear weapons \u2014 one of the reasons he was awarded the prize \u2014 would fail unless the world insisted \u201cthat nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system.\u201d\n\u201cSanctions must exact a real price,\u201d he said. \u201cIntransigence must be met with increased pressure \u2014 and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one.\u201d\nYet inside the White House there is real doubt that the world will stand as one. Russia and China are reluctant to sign on to sanctions against Iran, particularly sanctions that strike at its oil exports or gasoline imports. Mr. Obama declared that \u201cthose who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war.\u201d But he stopped short of answering the hardest question about Iran, one he might face in months. In his conception of \u201cjust war,\u201d would Israel be justified in striking Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, as it has often hinted, because they pose an \u201cexistential threat\u201d?\nOr would that veer closer to Mr. Bush\u2019s justifications for toppling Saddam Hussein in 2003, a dictator who was not preparing an imminent attack of his own?\nMichael Walzer, the author of the classic work \u201cJust and Unjust Wars,\u201d published first in 1977 and updated through decades of subsequent conflicts, large and small, wrote a few years ago that the Iraq invasion\u2019s \u201ccause was not (as in 1991) an actual Iraqi attack on a neighboring state or even an imminent threat of attack; nor was the cause an actual, on-going massacre.\u201d Many of the threats Mr. Obama talked about \u2014 the plotting of terrorists in well-protected mountain redoubts, the gradual development of nuclear weapons capacity, \u201cgenocide in Darfur, systematic rape in Congo, repression in Burma\u201d \u2014 unfold over years. Each has proved resistant to preventive diplomacy.\nStriking too early risks shades of Mr. Bush\u2019s discredited pre-emption doctrine, a return to American unilateralism. Striking too late invites disaster. That conundrum is \u201cthe world as it is.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/12/world/12sanger.html", "title": "Obama Outlines a Vision of Might and Right", "author": "DAVID E.

{"date": "Sun, 30 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BANGKOK \u2014 The Myanmar military has overwhelmed rebels from an ethnic Chinese minority in the northern reaches of the country, the junta\u2019s second victory over armed opponents in three months.\nThe routing over the weekend of the forces of the small, Chinese-speaking Kokang ethnic group gives Myanmar\u2019s governing generals momentum in their campaign to quell armed opposition before elections and the adoption of a new Constitution next year.\nSeveral well-armed groups, notably the Wa and Kachin, still stand in the way of the junta\u2019s goal of complete control over the country. But a recently announced agreement of solidarity among the rebel groups, which had the potential to slow the central government\u2019s advance against the Kokang, may be fraying.\nThe Myanmar government\u2019s strategy, analysts say, appears to be to challenge the groups one by one and to try to capitalize on the many factions within each group.\nIn June, the military defeated ethnic Karen insurgents along the border with Thailand, aided by a local militia of Karen Buddhists who led an attack on forces that were largely made up of Karen Christians.\nTo defeat the Kokang, the small ethnic group in the north, the junta allied itself with a defector and chased out troops loyal to the Kokang\u2019s chairman, Peng Jiasheng.\nA force of 2,000 Wa soldiers had initially come to the assistance of the Kokang, but they retreated Friday, according to Aung Kyaw Zaw, a former rebel based on the Chinese side of the border. This appeared to undercut a mutual-assistance agreement that the rebel groups reached several weeks ago.\nLate on Sunday, Myanmar\u2019s official media broke their silence on the fighting with a television broadcast announcing that clashes had ended and providing what appeared to be a preliminary death toll of 26 members of government security forces and 8 Kokang militiamen, The Associated Press reported. \u201cThe region has now regained peace,\u201d the official announcement said.\nChinese state media said that two Chinese citizens had also been killed in the fighting.\nNews services reported from southern China that Kokang forces were continuing to flee across the border into China on Sunday on the heels of what United Nations and Chinese officials estimated were as many as 30,000 civilian refugees. Nearly half the estimated 1,500 members of the Kokang militia have crossed the border and handed their weapons to the Chinese authorities, according to Mr. Aung Kyaw Zaw.\nThe central government\u2019s assaults on the Kokang, which began last week, have put other ethnic groups on alert, according to Brang Lai, a local official in the Kachin headquarters in Laiza, along the Chinese border.\n\u201cPeople are very concerned,\u201d Mr. Brang Lai said in a telephone interview. On the Chinese side of Laiza, residents have put Chinese flags on their roofs in the hope that they will be able to avoid any additional fighting. Officers from the Myanmar military\u2019s Northern Division were in Laiza over the weekend to call for calm, Mr. Brang Lai said.\nFollowers of Mr. Peng, the Kokang\u2019s chairman, were spotted by reporters on the Chinese side of the border buying civilian clothes to replace their militia uniforms.\n\u201cThere was no way we would win,\u201d Ri Chenchuan, a Kokang rebel, said as he shopped for new clothes, The A.P. reported.\nThe Myanmar government has signed more than a dozen cease-fire agreements with ethnic groups over the past two decades, but the fighting with the Kokang raised questions about the military\u2019s intentions.\nAung Din, executive director of the United States Campaign for Burma, an advocacy group that opposes the junta, said the generals apparently had adopted a more aggressive posture, partly influenced by the Sri Lankan government\u2019s military victory over Tamil rebels in May.\nSri Lanka\u2019s president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, met with Myanmar\u2019s generals in June in what was his first overseas trip after the defeat of the Tamil Tigers. The visit might have inspired Myanmar\u2019s senior general, Than Shwe, who has spent much of his military career battling ethnic groups, Mr. Aung Din said.\n\u201cIt was an encouragement to the regime to do away with the insurgency once and for all,\u201d Mr. Aung Din said. \u201cTheir thinking has changed.\u201d\nThe motives and strategies of Myanmar\u2019s leaders have long been difficult to divine. General Than Shwe is a very secretive man and the state-run media are highly selective in their reporting. The report on Sunday evening was the first time they had mentioned the campaign against the Kokang.\nThe fighting appears to have strained Myanmar\u2019s relations with China, especially since the Kokang are ethnically Chinese. The Chinese Foreign Ministry warned Myanmar on Friday to \u201cproperly handle domestic problems and maintain stability in the China-Myanmar border region.\u201d\nAnalysts said that the Chinese government had asked Myanmar\u2019s generals to refrain from initiating military campaigns before the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic on Oct. 1.\nIn that light, China could view Myanmar\u2019s campaign as provocative, especially since China is a large investor in Myanmar and plays the role of the junta\u2019s protective big brother in the United Nations and other international forums.\nMr. Aung Kyaw Zaw said he suspected that the Myanmar generals wanted to demonstrate their independence to Chinese leaders. Their message, he said, is that \u201cif we want to fight along the border, we can fight.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a political game,\u201d he added.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/world/asia/31iht-myanmar.html", "title": "Myanmar Army Routs Ethnic Chinese Rebels in the North", "author": "THOMAS FULLER"}
{"date": "Mon, 09 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli elections seemed to be tightening just before voting on Tuesday, injecting a measure of energy to what had been a largely listless campaign. But with little certainty or excitement about the results in a nation weary of its politics, hopes rose that before leaving office, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert might cut a deal for the release of a captured Israeli soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit.\nThe return of the soldier, who was seized by Hamas and other Palestinian militants in a cross-border raid and taken into Gaza in June 2006, would close a circle for the Israeli government, which came to power that May, and would burnish the reputations of Mr. Olmert, who is unpopular and is often criticized as weak and corrupt, and those ministers who seek to replace him.\nSigns of progress in the Shalit case are unlikely to affect the outcome of the elections on Tuesday, said Yehuda Ben Meir, a public opinion expert at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, because there is a broad public consensus that the soldier\u2019s release must be obtained.\nBut the case has gripped Israelis, Mr. Ben Meir said. The possibility of a deal, he added, is also an \"emotional issue\" for Mr. Olmert, who Mr. Ben Meir said wanted to \"clear his desk\" before leaving office.\nBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud Party has led in the latest opinion polls, with the centrist Kadima Party, led by Tzipi Livni, the current foreign minister, following close behind.\nBut an unusually high percentage of Israelis, according to pollsters, were wavering over whom to vote for until the last moment.\nFor American foreign policy, the elections have seemed particularly important, given how early they are arriving in the administration of President Obama, who has signaled a different approach to the Middle East from his predecessor\u2019s. But the uncertainty over who might win, and whether any new coalition would be more centrist or right wing, has made it difficult to forecast directions in the friendship between America and Israel.\nFor months, Israelis assumed that a victory for Mr. Netanyahu was a foregone conclusion, based on successive opinion polls. But in the final days of the campaign, the election became too close to call.\nThe leading candidates, Mr. Netanyahu and Ms. Livni, appealed to their natural constituencies not to waste votes on smaller, special interest parties.\nMr. Netanyahu, who had been somewhat vague on policy in the hope of attracting the widest possible support, made a pitch to the right, visiting the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Sunday and pledging not to hand the region back to Syria, from which Israel seized it in 1967.\nLikud urged Israeli conservatives not to give their votes to Avigdor Lieberman\u2019s Yisrael Beitenu, a hawkish party that rose to third place in recent polls; Likud warned that every vote that did not go to Likud would only benefit Ms. Livni.\nBased on similar logic, Ms. Livni, who led negotiations with the Western-backed Palestinian leadership of the West Bank over the last year, appealed to voters in the center and on the left.\nMr. Olmert, who was accused of corruption and was pushed to resign from office \u2014 partly by Ms. Livni, who replaced him at Kadima\u2019s helm \u2014 belatedly endorsed her candidacy late Sunday.\n\u201cIt will come as no surprise when I say that I support Kadima and hope Tzipi Livni will be elected prime minister,\u201d Mr. Olmert said, describing her as \u201cthe candidate who can lead the state of Israel to peace.\u201d\nRegardless of the erosion of the Likud Party\u2019s lead, recent polls suggest that the right-wing bloc in the new Parliament is likely to be much stronger than the center-left bloc, which would make it easier for Mr. Netanyahu to form a governing coalition.\nBoth Mr. Netanyahu and Ms. Livni have stated a preference for a national unity government, possibly including the Labor Party, which is led by Defense Minister Ehud Barak; it had the fourth largest following in recent polls.\nIn all, 33 parties are running in the election, though many of them have little or no chance of passing the threshold for representation in Parliament, 2 percent of votes cast. Among them are two green parties and others fighting for the rights of divorced fathers, against organized crime, and against banks\u2019 greed.\nIn a bizarre combination that was intended to attract attention and votes \u2014 and that some have found distasteful \u2014 Holocaust survivors joined forces with alumni of the Green Leaf Party, who advocate legalizing cannabis. The cannabis advocates endorse the survivors\u2019 rights to more benefits. The survivors endorse the younger generation\u2019s right to get high.\nWhoever wins Tuesday\u2019s election, the negotiations for forming a governing coalition are likely to take weeks.\nIt is during that time, alongside an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire for Gaza, that Israeli officials hope to reach a formula for the release of Corporal Shalit.\nMr. Barak said Sunday that a \u201csupreme effort\u201d was being made for the soldier\u2019s return. Hamas has demanded the release of hundreds of Palestinian security prisoners from Israeli jails, including some convicted of deadly terrorist acts.\nRafi Eitan, a cabinet minister who was recently asked to join the small government team working on the Shalit case, told Army Radio on Monday that it was \u201cvery likely that the entire process involving Hamas and Gilad Shalit will mature during Olmert\u2019s term.\u201d\nMr. Olmert has cautioned against undue expectations, calling recent Israeli news reports of an imminent deal \u201cexaggerated and damaging,\u201d and urging \u201cdue caution regarding all that is said.\u201d\nCorporal Shalit\u2019s family, which has been critical of government inaction in the past, issued a statement on Monday saying it believed the current government was \u201cworking with full determination to fulfill its obligation \u2014 to bring Gilad Shalit home before the end of its term.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/world/middleeast/10israel.html", "title": "Israeli Vote Brings Push for Release of a Soldier", "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER"}
{"date": "Sat, 25 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ZAGREB, Croatia \u2014 Six months have passed since Ivana Hodak, a glamorous young lawyer who was part of her country\u2019s \u201cGolden Generation,\u201d was shot and killed in the stairwell of her family home, leaving a nagging mystery of whether she was truly slain by a homeless drifter or by a hired killer.\nThe passage of time has done little to resolve the questions in the murder case, one of the most prominent here since Croatia declared independence in 1991.\nThe killing has been connected in the public consciousness with two other deaths two weeks later: those of the editor and marketing chief of the magazine Nacional, who were killed by a car bomb while the editor was investigating organized crime.\nThough there is no evidence linking them, the killings have prompted national soul-searching. \u201cThe question we are facing is: us, the rule of law; or them, the criminals, the terrorists and the mafia,\u201d Stjepan Mesic, Croatia\u2019s president, said.\nThe fatal attacks have generated alarm in the European Union, heightening concerns that lawlessness dating to the Balkan wars of the 1990s has erupted in Croatia, which joined NATO this month and is next in line to join the European Union, the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc.\nIn the Hodak case, the police arrested a former tennis academy janitor, Mladen Slogar, in February and said he confessed that he killed her because he bore a grudge against her father, Zvonimir Hodak, a powerful lawyer. But in a region prone to conspiracy theories, the Hodak case has spawned many.\nOne of the main doubters is Mr. Hodak, 72, who has defended some of Croatia\u2019s most notorious gangsters and war crimes suspects. He expressed skepticism about the evidence.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t buy it,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cTo me, it looks like a professional killing rather than an amateur. This case has been overshadowed by petty lies. Why would someone want to kill Ivana? Why not kill me instead?\u201d\nMr. Hodak said he believed that his daughter\u2019s killing was linked to the arrest of one of his clients, a former Croatian general, Vladimir Zagorec, who in March was sentenced to seven years in prison for embezzling $5 million worth of gems.\nMr. Zagorec, who helped procure weapons for Croatia during its war with rebel Serbs from 1991 to 1995, circumventing an international arms embargo, was accused of stealing the jewels to help purchase an air defense system on the black market.\nThe prosecution of Mr. Zagorec was instigated by testimony from his archenemy, Hrvoje Petrac, the most notorious crime boss in Croatia, who is in prison for orchestrating the kidnapping of Mr. Zagorec\u2019s son in 2005.\nDuring his trial, Mr. Petrac testified that Mr. Zagorec had asked him to find a buyer for the stolen jewels. That prompted state prosecutors to investigate and led to Mr. Zagorec\u2019s arrest.\nAt the time of Ms. Hodak\u2019s death, she was working at her father\u2019s firm on the Zagorec case. Investigators say the work may have taken a precarious turn last summer when she fell in love with Ljubo Pavasovic, Mr. Petrac\u2019s lawyer. The relationship created a potentially lethal conflict of interest, with her father and her boyfriend defending bitter foes who were considered vengeful and dangerous.\nFriends say Ms. Hodak, 26, fashioned herself as a Croatian version of Carrie Bradshaw from \u201cSex and the City.\u201d\nAlthough Ms. Hodak worked at two jobs, raised money for African children and rescued stray dogs, friends said she also pined for fancy labels and dated rich and powerful men. One person who knew Ms. Hodak recalled that when her friends proposed a three-month motorbike adventure in South America, sleeping under the stars, she responded: \u201cOnly if it is five-stars.\u201d\nAt her funeral her friends all wore black dresses and brightly colored stiletto heels. Her best friend, Jelena Percin, said in a eulogy: \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely fabulous.\u201d\nIva Majoli, a former international tennis star who vacationed with Ms. Hodak last summer, said she remained baffled by the killing. \u201cShe was a sweet girl, smart and sincere,\u201d Ms. Majoli said. \u201cShe appeared to have no cares in the world. I can\u2019t believe she is gone. Who would want to kill her?\u201d\nSome Croatians suspect that the answer lies in the simmering class resentment that is a legacy of the war here, which left thousands without homes, limbs or jobs. A select few, however, those who had strong ties to the authoritarian government of former President Franjo Tudjman, amassed unimaginable fortunes. The children of these families, including Ms. Hodak, were dubbed the Golden Generation in the Croatian media. Hajrudin Hromadzic, a sociologist at the University of Zagreb, said the Hodak killing reflected a deep socio-economic chasm found across the Balkans.\n\u201cYou have a small elite of the rich and powerful, and the rest of the population who live down the social hierarchy without any benefits of patronage or wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cIvana was part of the former, and a likely victim of the latter.\u201d\nIn February, the police said they had arrested Mr. Slogar, a 61-year-old homeless man with no police record. According to the police, Mr. Slogar, who was fired in 1995 from a tennis club where Mr. Hodak played regularly, bore a grudge against the lawyer because he claimed Mr. Hodak had reneged on the promise of a job.\nOn Oct. 6, the police say, Mr. Slogar went to town to buy shampoo. He told the police that he came upon Ms. Hodak parking her car and recognized her, having last seen her 14 years before. He followed her to her house, he said, before shooting her.\nHe was charged with murder, the authorities said, after the pistol used to kill Ms. Hodak was found in the abandoned warehouse where he slept.\nNeither Mr. Slogar\u2019s arrest nor his reported confession has convinced the many doubters.\nIn reaction to the killings in October, the government almost immediately dismissed the chiefs of the police and the judiciary. It also created an office to fight organized crime, which resulted in the arrests of a number of suspects in a mafia crackdown.\nBerislav Jelinic, a senior editor at Nacional who says he has received death threats because of his investigations, said organized crime remained widespread, and perhaps inevitable.\n\u201cThe problem with the mafia here is that we are a small country,\u201d he said. \u201cCriminals, entrepreneurs, politicians, gangsters, old money and new money all hang out in the same places, united by cash, not class.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/world/europe/26croatia.html", "title": "Arrest in Croatia Murder Doesn\u2019t Erase All Doubt", "author": "DAN BILEFSKY"}

{"date": "Sat, 12 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Iran\u2019s foreign minister said Saturday that his country was willing to exchange most of its uranium for processed nuclear fuel from abroad \u2014 as the United Nations has proposed \u2014 but only according to a timetable that Western powers appear to have already rejected.\nThe statement by Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki came just days before a scheduled meeting of the United States and its allies to discuss possible new sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program \u2014 and may be aimed at trying to divide them, analysts said.\nMr. Mottaki said Iran would agree to hand over 400 kilograms, or 882 pounds, of uranium initially \u2014 about a third of the amount proposed in a draft agreement reached under United Nations auspices in October \u2014 in exchange for an equivalent amount of enriched material to fuel a medical research reactor, according to Iranian news agencies. The remainder of the material would be traded over \u201cseveral years.\u201d\nA senior Obama administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Saturday that the Iranian statement did not appear to be consistent with the agreement proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations body, in consultation with the United States, Russia and France.\n\u201cThe terms of that agreement,\u201d the administration official said, \u201ccall for Iran to send 1,200 kilograms of its low-enriched uranium to Russia in one batch, where it would be further enriched and then sent to France for fabrication into fuel assemblies. We remain committed to these terms.\u201d\nThe tentative deal reached in October was intended to bridge the gap between Iran\u2019s assertion that it wants only civilian nuclear energy and Western suspicions about a weapons program, buying time for a broader diplomatic solution.\nUnder that deal, Iran would send out the bulk of its uranium in one shipment to allay Western fears that it was enriching the remainder for military purposes. The agreement envisioned the transfer taking place before the end of this year.\nThe uranium shipped out would be returned in a form usable for Iran\u2019s research reactor but very difficult to convert to weapons production.\nIran has sent mixed signals on the nuclear deal in recent weeks, with some comments suggesting that it has decisively rejected it in any form, and others hinting that the matter was unresolved. Iran\u2019s deliberations appear to have been affected by internal divisions since the contested June presidential election and its violent aftermath.\nUnder the new proposal, the uranium exchange would take place on the Iranian island of Kish in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Mottaki said at a regional security conference in Bahrain.\nThe details of the proposal were vague, and it was unclear whether he was reverting to an earlier counterproposal already rejected by world powers: that international arms inspectors take custody of much of Iran\u2019s fuel, but keep it on Kish.\n\u201cI think the reason for this gesture is that there is now some unanimity on pursuing sanctions,\u201d said Valerie Lincy, a senior researcher with the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a Washington-based nonprofit group.\nThe Iranians appear to be hoping their proposal will divide the powers that are considering sanctions, she added.\nRussia and China have traditionally been reluctant to impose new sanctions, but United States leaders have hoped that Iran\u2019s recent intransigence would convince them to change their stance.\nMr. Mottaki also suggested that the Western news media had helped torpedo the October agreement by framing it in hostile terms that confirmed Iran\u2019s fears of losing its nuclear supplies.\n\u201cWe said we are in agreement on the principles of the proposal, but suddenly the Western media announced that 1,200 kilograms of uranium would be leaving Iran to delay the construction of a nuclear bomb,\u201d Mr. Mottaki said, according to Iran\u2019s semiofficial Mehr news agency. \u201cIs this the answer to Iran\u2019s confidence-building?\u201d\nAlso on Saturday, thousands of clerics rallied in cities across Iran for a second day to express their anger at protesters who had burned pictures of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during antigovernment demonstrations last week, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported. Ayatollah Khamenei holds a semidivine authority in Iran, and burning his image violated a taboo.\nProtesters have taken to the streets intermittently since the election in June.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/world/middleeast/13iran.html", "title": "Iran Avows Willingness to Swap Some Uranium", "author": "ROBERT F.

{"date": "Tue, 04 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BETHLEHEM, West Bank \u2014 The mainstream Palestinian movement Fatah came together here on Tuesday for a landmark three-day gathering, its first in 20 years and its first ever on Palestinian soil.\nThe opening ceremony was festive and emotional, though the celebratory tone did not dispel the difficult situation Fatah found itself in. It has struggled to recover from a humiliating defeat by Hamas, its Islamic rival, in the 2006 elections and the subsequent loss of Gaza. Fatah continues to be riddled with internal divisions, and many participants said the conference might be the movement\u2019s last chance to revive.\n\u201cWe have made mistakes,\u201d said Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president and leader of Fatah. \u201cTwenty years is too long.\u201d The conference, he said, should be a \u201cplatform for a new start.\u201d\nAbout 2,000 delegates from all over the world are attending the conference, at a school near Manger Square. Israel, which controls the West Bank borders and is interested in bolstering the more moderate Palestinian forces, allowed in Fatah members from hostile states like Syria.\nYet Hamas prevented hundreds of Fatah delegates from leaving Gaza to participate, a decision that has deepened the Palestinian divide.\nIn order to confront dual challenges \u2014 Hamas and setbacks in the peace process with Israel \u2014 the Fatah delegates want to use the conference to devise a clearly defined, unifying program for the movement and to elect new representatives for its decision-making bodies. The rank and file wants to inject new blood into the moribund leadership committees; many of their members have died over the years.\nDimitri Diliani, 36, a Fatah activist from Jerusalem who is vying for a seat on the Revolutionary Council, the Fatah parliament, said new leadership would \u201cat least try to do better than the 20-year-old one.\n\u201cAnything is better.\u201d\nThe day was filled with contradictory messages reflecting the disarray in Fatah. A huge poster on the wall bore the legend \u201cResistance is the legitimate right of our people\u201d alongside a black-and-white photograph from the 1960s of a Palestinian youth with a gun.\nMr. Abbas reminisced about the early years of armed struggle against Israel. But he also stressed the need for new, more appropriate forms of resistance while pursuing negotiations for an independent Palestinian state. He blamed a lack of discipline in part for Fatah\u2019s failures.\nA stickler for law and order, Mr. Abbas also proudly noted that Palestinians now wear their seat belts, or face being fined.\nAs his speech rambled into its second hour, the air filled with cigarette smoke; people started dozing off, milling around and leaving the hall.\nMr. Abbas is a pale successor to Yasir Arafat, the deceased Palestinian leader and founder of Fatah. Mr. Arafat, a fiery orator and a revolutionary at heart, would never have spoken of seat belts. His picture peered down at the conference proceedings, and every mention of him was greeted with rapturous applause.\nYet Mr. Abbas has proved to be a reliable leader. He said he was proud to have been by Mr. Arafat\u2019s side in making the decision to begin an armed struggle in 1965. But he said that Fatah had since moved on to political pragmatism and the pursuit of international legitimacy.\nMr. Abbas made it clear that resistance should be limited, taking the form of popular protests and demonstrations like those held weekly against Israel\u2019s security barrier in Bilin and other villages of the West Bank.\nThe concept of the armed struggle is likely to be the subject of heated debate at the conference. Many members want Fatah to remain a liberation movement until the goal of a Palestinian state has been achieved.\n\u201cWe want to combine politics and resistance until the Palestinian national project is complete,\u201d said Ismail Tilawi, a delegate from Ramallah.\nThe younger generation of Fatah has been agitating for a party conference for years. Given the weakness of the movement, the fact that it is taking place in the West Bank is widely seen by Palestinians as a victory for Fatah and Mr. Abbas.\nNow the Palestinians \u2014 like the Israelis and the international backers of Fatah \u2014 are waiting to see the results.\n\u201cHaving the conference at all is a miracle, and having it in the homeland is another miracle,\u201d Mr. Abbas said. \u201cBut the outcome of the convention is more important than these two miracles.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/world/middleeast/05fatah.html", "title": "Abbas Urges \u2018New Start\u2019 at Fatah Conference", "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER"}
{"date": "Sun, 06 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Perhaps only a \u201chandful\u201d of American troops will be leaving Afghanistan in July 2011, the date President Obama has set to begin a gradual withdrawal, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said in an interview broadcast Sunday.\n\u201cWe will have 100,000 forces, troops there,\u201d Mr. Gates said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d \u201cand they are not leaving in July of 2011. Some, handful, or some small number, or whatever the conditions permit, will begin to withdraw at that time.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider this an exit strategy,\u201d he continued, \u201cThis is a transition.\u201d He said it would begin in less-contested parts of Afghanistan before expanding to the most obdurate Taliban strongholds, largely in the south and east.\nThe White House used appearances on the Sunday talk programs to convey that the deadline would mark the start, not the end, of troop withdrawal. \u201c2011 is not a cliff, it\u2019s a ramp,\u201d Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser, said.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s when the effects of this increase will be, by all accounts, according to our military commanders and our senior civilians, where we will be able to see very, very visible progress and we\u2019ll be able to make a shift,\u201d General Jones said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\nMr. Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who unusually appeared together on three Sunday programs, emphasized that the July 2011 date did not signal a wholesale abandonment of Afghanistan that could further destabilize the region.\nThey said it was important to impart a sense of urgency to the Afghan government about the need to move expeditiously to assume responsibility for their own security.\n\u201cWe will not provide for their security forever,\u201d Mr. Gates said.\nBut the message he and Mrs. Clinton conveyed also seemed meant for Pakistan, which fears the reverberations of any overly hasty American pullout, and for Republican critics of any notion of a fixed withdrawal deadline.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be walking away from Afghanistan again,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cWe did that before; it didn\u2019t turn out very well.\u201d\nMr. Gates also said that \u201cI think it has been years\u201d since American intelligence had a good idea of the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, though the Qaeda leader is thought to be either in Pakistan\u2019s rugged North Waziristan region or just across the border in Afghanistan.\nGeneral Jones, also asked about Mr. bin Laden\u2019s location, answered: \u201cThe best estimate is that he is somewhere in North Waziristan, sometimes on the Pakistani side of the border, sometimes on the Afghan side of the border.\u201d\nBoth Secretaries Gates and Clinton favorably mentioned President Hamid Karzai\u2019s recent assurance that Afghan security forces could resume control of some provinces within three years, and over the bulk of the country in five.\nWhile the new strategy aims in part to lure lower-level Taliban fighters away, partly through offers of jobs, Mrs. Clinton expressed doubt that key Taliban leaders could be thus enticed. Any defecting Taliban member, she said, would have to renounce al-Qaeda, forswear violence and vow to live by Afghan laws. As to whether senior leaders would do that, she said, \u201cI\u2019m highly skeptical.\u201d\nMr. Obama\u2019s new strategy \u2014 built around the rapid deployment of 30,000 additional American troops and thousands more NATO forces \u2014 has faced some of its toughest criticism from his fellow Democrats. It has received stronger, if conditional, support from some Republicans.\nSenator John McCain of Arizona, a Vietnam War veteran and member of the Armed Services Committee, has generally supported Mr. Obama\u2019s plan.\n\u201cI think he made the right decision,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d But the mention of the July 2011 date, he said, had left policy makers throughout the region \u2014 including in Pakistan and India \u2014 \u201ctrying to figure out whether, really, they can go all in and support this effort.\u201d\nHe and other Republicans fear that the 2011 date will encourage Taliban and al-Qaeda forces to simply outwait their enemy.\nThe appearances by Mr. Gates and Clinton \u2014 two of the president\u2019s most important advisers, and also two of the more hawkish \u2014 appeared designed to explain the withdrawal guideline.\n\u201cAfter saying that \u201csome, a handful, or small number\u201d of troops would leave in July 2011, Mr. Gates added that further departures would come only when American commanders on the ground assessed that local conditions had sufficiently improved.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about an abrupt withdrawal,\u201d Mr. Gates said, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about that something that will take place over a period of time.\u201d\nBut he also sought to prepare Americans, and their allies, for a short-term increase in casualties.\n\u201cThe tragedy is that the casualties will probably continue to grow, at least for the time being,\u201d he said, because, as during the so-called troop surge in Iraq, the new coalition troops would be going to some of the most hostile parts of the country.\nMr. Gates added, however, that \u201cwe\u2019ll have an increase in casualties at the front end of this process, but over time it\u2019ll actually lead to fewer casualties\u201d as security grows.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/world/asia/07policy.html", "title": "Gates Calls July 2011 the Beginning, Not End, of Afghan Withdrawal", "author": "BRIAN KNOWLTON"}
{"date": "Fri, 30 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 A suspect in the 9/11 plot whose German passport was found in a mud hut in western Pakistan this week has not been in touch with his family for two years, his mother said in a telephone interview on Friday.\nThe suspect, Said Bahaji, a German citizen whose father is Moroccan, was the main logistics supporter of the 9/11 attackers, paying their rent and telephone bills, according to the authorities. The Pakistani military said it found his German passport five days ago in the village of Sherwangai in South Waziristan, during a search operation.\nMr. Bahaji was part of the Hamburg cell of Al Qaeda, a tightly knit group of young Arab men who met in Germany in the mid- to late 1990s under the leadership of Mohamed Atta, who eventually became the central planner of the 9/11 attacks.\nA Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said that Mr. Bahaji was not in custody, and that the military did not know whether he was dead or alive. He said the passport stamp for Mr. Bahaji\u2019s entry into Pakistan \u2014 Sept. 4, 2001 \u2014 was too old to shed any light on his current whereabouts.\nThe Pakistani military is in the second week of a major military operation against militants in their South Waziristan stronghold, and General Abbas said one aim was to flush out foreigners.\nGerman intelligence officials have said they believe that Mr. Bahaji, who is still on the German authorities\u2019 wanted list, has been in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas since Sept. 11, 2001. The discovery of the passport this week was the first concrete evidence.\nMany top Qaeda members are believed to have taken refuge in the area. A Pakistani intelligence official interviewed on Friday said the discovery \u201cproves that our militants have had close associations with Al Qaeda.\u201d\nAmerican drone attacks have killed a number of senior Qaeda members in the tribal areas, including Usama al-Kini, a Kenyan, who was the group\u2019s operations chief in Pakistan, as well as Baitullah Mehsud, who led the Pakistani Taliban.\nGerman officials reached by telephone on Friday did not give details about Mr. Bahaji\u2019s last known contact, but said they did not dispute the time frame given by his mother, Anneliese Bahaji.\nMrs. Bahaji, 76, a German citizen, said her son also had a Moroccan passport, so it was possible that he was traveling with that.\nMr. Bahaji, who was born in June 1975, had never been to Pakistan before setting off in September 2001, his mother said. She said he had told her and his wife, Nese Kul, a German citizen of Turkish descent, from whom he is now divorced, that he was going to Pakistan for an internship at a computer company there.\nMrs. Bahaji last heard from him in 2007, when he telephoned her. \u201cHe said he just wanted to call and say he\u2019s still alive,\u201d she said by telephone from northern Germany, where she lives.\nIn many ways, the passport raised more questions than it answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think that they\u2019ve found his passport now,\u201d Mrs. Bahaji said, sounding sad. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d\nThe Hamburg cell seemed to be the one place where Mr. Bahaji felt truly accepted. He tried to enter a military academy in Morocco, his mother said, but was turned down because he had asthma. When he moved to Germany, she added, he was required to attend additional classes before his Moroccan high school degree would be accepted, deepening his sense that he was a stranger there.\nIn late 1998, according to evidence introduced in a German court in the trial of another Hamburg cell member, Mounir el-Motassadeq, Mr. Bahaji and Mr. Atta moved into an apartment near the university where they had been studying in Hamburg. The young men grew increasingly radical, with the help of a German of Syrian origin, Mohamed Heidar Zammar, who had fought in Bosnia and was believed to be a Qaeda operative.\nMr. Bahaji grew close to Mr. Atta and the other members of the cell. They attended Mr. Bahaji\u2019s wedding in October 1999, at Al Quds mosque in Hamburg, feasting on Moroccan tagine stew with plums and sweets, his wife, Ms. Kul, said in an interview in 2002.\nA video of the event was introduced as evidence in the German court. Men sat separately from the women, Ms. Kul said, and Marwan al-Shehhi, who piloted the second plane that struck the World Trade Center, sang songs about jihad.\nRelatives were reportedly shocked at the change in Mr. Bahaji, who had grown a long beard, much to his mother\u2019s chagrin. \u201cThe beard has to go,\u201d Mrs. Bahaji told him, and he replied, \u201cNo, the beard stays,\u201d she said in an interview two years ago.\nThe last time Ms. Kul saw Mr. Bahaji was on Sept. 3, 2001. Before departing he went to the mosque where they had gotten married. When he returned, his hair was cut short, she said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/world/asia/31plotter.html", "title": "After 2 Years, a Sign of a 9/11 Suspect", "author": "SOUAD MEKHENNET and SABRINA TAVERNISE"}

One of the officers cupped his hands and asked Mr. Fischbach to blow into them. \u201cThis was their Breathalyzer,\u201d Mrs. Fischbach said, recounting her astonishment on the last night of her vacation with her husband, his sister and brother-in-law and their daughter. \u201cThey tried very hard, but Scott doesn\u2019t drink.\u201d\nThe police took his driver\u2019s license and told him they would take him to jail unless he came up with $300, she said.

{"date": "Wed, 08 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LOD, Israel \u2014 The beauty of the exquisitely preserved ancient mosaic only seemed to underline the incongruity of its surroundings.\nThe late-Roman-era mosaic floor, one of the largest and finest in Israel, was unveiled by the authorities last week for just the second time since it was discovered 13 years ago in the dilapidated eastern section of this poor town near the international airport, south of Tel Aviv.\nSome 1,700 years old, the magnificent tiled floor spreads over almost 2,000 square feet, shaded from the harsh summer sun by a thin awning and surrounded by a canvas fence. A panoply of colorful depictions of birds, fish, exotic animals and merchant ships, the mosaic conjures up an intriguing reminder of Lod\u2019s more glorious past.\nThe archaeologists of the Israel Antiquities Authority believe the mosaic, which lacks any inscriptions, was commissioned by a wealthy individual who owned a grand villa here. Lod, which is mentioned in the Bible, was an important center in ancient times, and this part of it is known to have been a neighborhood of the rich.\nToday, the site is overlooked by drab apartment blocks with laundry hanging on lines out of windows, surrounded by garbage-strewn yards. A mixed city of Jewish immigrants and Muslim and Christian Arabs, modern Lod is usually associated with hardship, its diverse population largely of low socioeconomic standing and often described by local officials as a challenge.\nNow, though, the authorities here hope to revitalize Lod and turn it, of all things, into a major tourist destination thanks to the treasures lurking under the city\u2019s more modern layers of earth.\n\u201cThis is not the strongest city in Israel,\u201d acknowledged Ilan Harari, the mayor of the city, who attended the rare opening of the mosaic site. But in the future, he said, it will be an \u201camazing tourist center. We believe thousands will come.\u201d\nThe Lod mosaic was discovered in 1996, when Miriam Avissar, an archaeologist for the Israel Antiquities Authority, was sent to carry out a routine salvage excavation because the local council wanted to widen a road. This area of old Lod was already known to be rich in mosaics, but most were badly damaged or under buildings.\n\u201cI saw a white frame, then a tiger,\u201d said Ms. Avissar, who has recently retired, recalling her first glimpses of the mosaic. \u201cIt was completely flat and in marvelous condition.\u201d\nOnce exposed, the mosaic was put on public display for a single weekend, during which some 30,000 Israelis flocked to see it. It was then covered up again while the antiquities authority sought financing to carry out the necessary conservation work and to build appropriate facilities at the site.\nDonations have now been found and the project is being revived. The mosaic was briefly revealed last Wednesday to news organizations, and is to open to the public for three days, starting Thursday. It will then be removed to a laboratory in Jerusalem for painstaking conservation. In 2010, a section will be sent to the United States for exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\nTwo years from now, the entire mosaic is supposed to be returned to this patch of ground in eastern Lod and put on permanent display in a protected environment.\nFor the residents who live around the site, the mosaic is a rare gem in an otherwise squalid landscape.\n\u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d said Amal Amin, 40, who was born in an Arab-style stone house adjacent to the site. \u201cThey say there is another mosaic under my parents\u2019 home.\u201d\nTatiana Zeitsef, a Jewish immigrant from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, living in a low-income apartment block across the street, said she had heard about the mosaic but had never seen it. Instead, like many in this run-down old section of the city, she complained about the garbage, saying \u201cnothing ever gets done.\u201d\nLod\u2019s 75,000 residents are mostly Jewish, with Arabs making up a quarter or more of the population. Previously an Arab city known as Lydda, it was conquered by Israeli forces in July 1948. Most of the Arab residents were expelled \u2014 on the personal orders of David Ben-Gurion, the leader of the new state of Israel, according to some historical accounts \u2014 and turned into refugees. At least 250 men, women and children were killed in the fighting; more died of exhaustion and dehydration on the march east in the summer heat.\nThe new Jewish immigrants came in waves, first from Morocco and Tunisia, and later from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union, forming a microcosm of modern Israel and its complex society.\nLod was first mentioned in a list of cities in Canaan, said to have been drawn up by an Egyptian pharaoh in 1465 B.C. Its central location on the coastal plain made it an important hub of ancient Jewish scholarship and a center for traders. More recently, it lent its name to Israel\u2019s international airport, until that was renamed for Mr. Ben-Gurion.\nIn recent decades, life here has been mostly peaceful, though residents point to underlying tensions. Some Jewish residents say the younger Arab generation is angry and increasingly hostile, while Sheikh Adel, the muezzin of a downtown mosque, pointed to a recent influx of religious Jewish nationalists who he said had come to the city \u201cto incite.\u201d\nAvraham Atia, who runs a bicycle repair shop not far from the mosaic in the old town center, summed up life in Lod with an expletive. \u201cLook around you,\u201d he added as dust billowed down the street, whipped up by a hot wind from a patch of wasteland nearby. \u201cEverything is ruined.\u201d\nThere has been some development, not here but in the newer end of town, to the south. Mr. Atia said he was desperate to escape.\nIn a pamphlet distributed by city hall, the city council says it sees the mosaic and the potential for tourism as a lever to a striking change in the image of Lod not just in the eyes of other Israelis and the tourists landing at the airport, but primarily in the minds of the local residents themselves.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/middleeast/09lod.html", "title": "Polishing a Lost Gem to Dazzle Tourists", "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER"}
{"date": "Thu, 05 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 The Dawa Party of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki was the overwhelming winner of Iraq\u2019s provincial elections, the first official results show. But while candidates in the slate backed by Dawa garnered the most votes of any party in nine of Iraq\u2019s provinces, the party fell short of being able to operate without coalition-building. The initial results reflect a vast majority, but not all, of the votes.\nStill, the results lifted Mr. Maliki\u2019s party from a minor player among Shiite parties to one that appeared on the road to being the most powerful.\nThe election outcome conveyed a dual message: many Iraqis want a strong central government, rather than one where regions hold more power than the center, but they do not want all the power in the hands of one party.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t seek to rule alone or marginalize anyone,\u201d said Hassan Sinead, a member of Parliament who is in the Dawa Party and an ally of Mr. Maliki. \u201cOn the contrary, we are open to the other parties, whether they won or lost the election, because we don\u2019t believe in the dictatorship of the regions or any other kind, because we are not dictators.\u201d\nSome politicians have voiced concerns in recent months that too much power was being concentrated in Mr. Maliki\u2019s hands, and the election results suggested that Iraqis were not ready to rally around a single leader. They responded far more enthusiastically to candidates who espoused a united Iraq that is Muslim, but not overtly sectarian.\n\u201cMaliki\u2019s message was nationalist and broad,\u201d said Jaber Habeeb, a professor of political science at Baghdad University who is also an independent Shiite member of Parliament. \u201cIn his speeches, he concentrated on rebuilding and securing the state more than using religious messages.\u201d\nMr. Maliki\u2019s party won a clear plurality in the large provinces of Baghdad and Basra, both places where the prime minister waged military campaigns last year to halt the activities of mostly Shiite militias.\nTensions between Arabs and Kurds, which have threatened to erupt into violence in northern Iraq, were largely unresolved by the election. In Nineveh, the Kurds have had an overwhelming majority on the provincial council although they are a minority in the province, because most Arabs sat out the last election. This time, a new Arab nationalist party, Al Hadba, took 48.4 percent, by far the largest share of the votes. The outcome could right the imbalance in the provincial government, but it remains to be seen whether the current provincial council members will step down and allow the new council to be seated.\nIn neighboring Kirkuk Province, where a vote was not held, the tensions run even higher and the situation is even more uncertain. Decades of gerrymandering, ethnic cleansing and forced expulsions of Kurds under Saddam Hussein \u2014 and the intimidation of Arabs since 2003 \u2014 have made it impossible for Kirkuk\u2019s Kurdish, Arabic, Turkmen and Christian populations to agree on who is eligible to vote. Kirkuk and the three Kurdish provinces that make up the Kurdistan region were the only four of Iraq\u2019s 18 provinces that did not hold elections.\nMuch like Mr. Maliki\u2019s Dawa Party, other parties that won seats in the Shiite south were Islamist but also nationalist. They include the parties backed by the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, which did surprisingly well, given that his movement decided to support them only two weeks before the elections.\nThe Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, a Shiite Islamist party led by the cleric Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, lost ground throughout the country. The party relied heavily on religious imagery and symbols during the campaign, but it lost even Mr. Hakim\u2019s home base of Najaf and received barely 5 percent of the votes in Baghdad. In the 2005 elections, it captured nearly 55 percent of the votes in Baghdad and dominated provincial politics.\nAlong with the Kurdish parties, the Supreme Council has been the strongest proponent of a weak central government and strong provinces or regions. It advocated the creation of a southern region that would resemble the semiautonomous Kurdish region in the north. Until these elections, the Supreme Council was dominant in most southern provinces.\nMore than 14,000 candidates from 400 political parties and lists took part in the elections last Saturday.\nOver all, the results remained divided along sectarian lines, with Shiite-majority provinces choosing Shiite parties and Sunni-majority provinces choosing Sunni parties.\nIn Baghdad, where Mr. Maliki ran a strongly nationalist campaign, he appeared to have had some success in winning votes from Sunnis, but in the Sunni-majority provinces to the north, his party\u2019s slate barely made a showing.\nEven in those provinces where he had strong support, the political picture was fractured. In Basra, in the south, Dawa candidates won their second highest proportion of votes, 37 percent, but they will still have to make deals to form coalitions with other parties to choose the provincial leadership. That is particularly true in provinces like Muthanna, where Dawa also came in first, but with only 11 percent of the vote. Under the provincial powers law, governors and deputy governors, as well as the provincial council chairmen and deputy chairmen, are chosen by a simple majority of the provincial councils.\nIn Babil Province, south of Baghdad, where Dawa won 12.5 percent, the most of any party, the party\u2019s leaders were disappointed. \u201cHaving 12 percent means we are going to have four seats on the council,\u201d said Nemma al-Bakri, a provincial Dawa leader. \u201cIt is a shock. We had expected to have 15 seats. This distribution will result in many disputes about who is going to be the next governor.\u201d\nExcept in areas where Sunnis were voting for the first time, the large, prominent parties with nationally known leaders won the most seats, showing the power of incumbency and the difficulties facing the newer secular parties. The secular parties fared best in the four Sunni-majority provinces.\nIn the Shiite south, religious parties dominated in every province, with the surprising exception of Karbala, Mr. Maliki\u2019s home province. There, a secular civic leader narrowly edged out the Dawa candidate. In the four predominantly Sunni provinces north and west of Baghdad, there was a greater range in the political views of the successful candidates, with a mix of tribal, secular and Sunni Islamist parties dividing the votes.\nAs election officials were preparing to announce the results, the police in Diyala Province said Thursday that a suicide bomber had blown himself up in a restaurant, killing 15 people in the town of Khanaqin, which has seen tension between Kurdish and Arab security forces.\nTensions simmered as well in Anbar Province, in the west, where several powerful tribal parties competed for provincial council seats with two established Sunni parties, one Islamist, Tawafiq, and another that has a more secular, Baathist tilt.\nThe electoral commission was still investigating accusations of voting fraud. Tamouz, a nongovernment organization monitoring the elections under contract with the United Nations, reported problems including several instances of ballot stuffing in Falluja by the Iraqi Islamic Party, the largest Sunni party in the Tawafiq coalition.\nSaadoun Obeid al-Jumaili, a lawyer who is on Falluja\u2019s municipal council, said the biggest problem was that many election workers at several polling stations were members of the Islamic Party.\nTwo officials from the Islamic Party in Falluja denied that and the accusations of ballot stuffing.\nBut the monitors insisted that they had observed irregularities. \u201cThe electoral commission was biased in favor of the Islamic Party in Anbar,\u201d said Sana\u2019a Hamed, the assistant director of the Tamouz election monitoring team.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/world/middleeast/06iraq.html", "title": "Prime Minister\u2019s Party Wins in Iraqi Vote but Will Need to Form Coalitions", "author": "ALISSA J.

{"date": "Sat, 21 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Near the guard tower outside this country\u2019s main counterterrorism training center, some of the concrete barriers are still scarred with shrapnel. They are kept as a reminder: in December 2004, a suicide bomber detonated his car there, in one of a series of deadly attacks by Islamist insurgents that shook this kingdom.\n\u201cIt was a wake-up call,\u201d said the commander of the training center, a tall, wiry officer in fatigues and a black beret who cannot publicly give his name for security reasons. \u201cThe situation was bad.\u201d A plaque just inside the commander\u2019s office bears the names of 57 Saudi officers who died fighting terrorists from 2003 to 2005.\nThose deaths forced a decisive shift here. Many Saudis had refused to recognize the country\u2019s growing reputation as an incubator of terrorism, even after the international outcry that followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nSince then, much has changed. When Saudi Arabia released its latest list of wanted terrorism suspects in January, all 85 of them were said to be outside the kingdom.\nThat fact was a measure of the ambitious counterterrorism program created here in the past few years. The government has cracked down ruthlessly on terrorist cells and financing, rooting out officers with extremist sympathies and building a much larger and more effective network of SWAT teams. Even regular police officers now get a full month of counterterrorism training every year.\n\u201cWe have killed or captured all the fighters, and the rest have fled to Afghanistan or Yemen,\u201d said the commander, in an assessment largely echoed by Western security officials. \u201cAll that remains here is some ideological apparatus.\u201d\nThe extent of that ideological apparatus remains uncertain. The list of 85 suspects that was released in January included 11 men who had been freed from the American prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, had passed through Saudi Arabia\u2019s widely praised rehabilitation program for jihadists, and then had fled the country. Two of them broadcast their aim of overthrowing the Saudi royal family in a video released on the Internet by the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda, in an embarrassing moment for the authorities here.\nBut the Saudi government, which once seemed unwilling to acknowledge this country\u2019s critical role in fostering jihadist violence around the world, has become far more open about the challenges it faces.\n\u201cWe are still at the beginning, we have a lot to learn,\u201d said Turki al-Otayan, the director of the rehabilitation program\u2019s psychological committee. Like others involved in the program, he conceded that the return of some of its graduates to terrorism was a blow, but he said he believed that the success rate (14 failures out of 218 graduates) was still impressive.\nMr. Otayan and his colleagues won a partial vindication last month when one of the two graduates who had fled to Yemen later returned to Saudi Arabia and gave himself up. But Mr. Otayan shrugged that off.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t guarantee that he won\u2019t go back to Yemen again,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with people, not cars.\u201d\nSaudi officials are also frank about the fact that Al Qaeda still has some popular sympathy here, though far less than before the bloody attacks from 2003 to 2005.\n\u201cChanging mind-sets is not easy, and it takes a long time,\u201d said Abdul Rahman al-Hadlag, the Interior Ministry\u2019s director of ideological security. \u201cWe have to monitor mosques and the Internet, because the extremists use these places to recruit people. Sometimes they even use afterschool activities. Sleeper cells exist.\u201d\nSome of the softer approaches to fighting terrorism, including the rehabilitation program, have been labeled coddling by Western critics. But the Saudi state must provide many former jihadists with jobs and financial assistance, Mr. Hadlag said, because if it does not, others will.\n\u201cSometimes the extremists leave money in envelopes under the door, with \u2018From your mujahedeen brothers\u2019 written on it,\u201d Mr. Hadlag said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let them be the good guys.\u201d\nThe postprison rehabilitation program, which is now being expanded, is only one part of a broader effort to address the issue of violent extremism across Saudi Arabia. It includes dialogues with \u2014 or even suppression of \u2014 the more extremist clerics. There are also a variety of outreach programs in areas known to harbor extremists, with the Interior Ministry sending its preferred clerics or sheiks to speak in schools and community centers for two or three weeks at a time.\nAt the same time, the kingdom has completely retooled its prison system, which had been criticized as having inhumane conditions. Five new prisons were built in a matter of months last year \u2014 as it happens, by the bin Laden family company \u2014 that hold 1,200 to 1,500 prisoners each.\nUnlike the old prisons, the new ones allow a maximum of four inmates to a cell, and Islamists are kept separate from common criminals for the first time, minimizing the spread of jihadist ideas, or so the theory goes.\nSome internal critics say that the \u201csoft\u201d counterterrorism strategies remain weak, and that the only way to address the roots of jihadist violence is by thoroughly reforming the Saudi educational system, a task that will take decades.\n\u201cOne major problem is that the sheiks they bring for these programs aren\u2019t authoritative,\u201d said Mshari al-Zaydi, a Saudi journalist and political analyst who is himself a former hard-liner, referring to the rehabilitation efforts. \u201cThey don\u2019t have credibility because they are seen as people who take money from the government.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Saudi Arabia\u2019s main terrorist threat appears to come from Yemen, where a number of Saudi extremists have regrouped in that country\u2019s mountainous, tribal hinterland. They have struck there repeatedly in the past year and have declared a goal of using Yemen as a base for attacks against Saudi Arabia. The border with Yemen is long and porous, and militants appear to have no trouble crossing it at will.\nFor all their success on the military front, Saudi officials seem cautious about declaring a victory against jihadists, especially when unexpected crises like the recent war between Israel and Hamas can create a sudden upwelling of popular anger that fuels extremist sentiment.\n\u201cWe are victims of terrorism,\u201d said the commander of the Riyadh training center, where 400 commandos sit ready to respond to attacks 24 hours a day. \u201cIt\u2019s not what the world thinks.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/world/middleeast/22saudi.html", "title": "Saudis Retool to Root Out Terrorist Risk", "author": "ROBERT F.

Biden Jr. said Tuesday that the United States would continue to support Ukraine\u2019s bid to join NATO despite Russia\u2019s objections.\nMr. Biden\u2019s visit to the region \u2014 taking place only two weeks after President Obama\u2019s summit meeting with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia \u2014 was intended to ease fears in Georgia and Ukraine over whether the Obama administration might withdraw support for their pro-Western governments to improve ties with Russia. Russian officials have been increasingly angered by deepening Western alliances in what it terms its \u201czone of privileged interests,\u201d and especially the proposed expansion of NATO to include Ukraine and Georgia, which were once part of the Soviet Union. Mr. Biden made it clear that the United States remained enthusiastic about the proposal.\n\u201cIf you choose to be part of Euro-Atlantic integration, which I believe you have, then we strongly support that,\u201d Mr. Biden said after a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Viktor A. Yushchenko. \u201cWe do not recognize \u2014 and I want to reiterate it \u2014 any sphere of influence. We do not recognize anyone else\u2019s right to dictate to you or any other country what alliances you seek to belong to or what bilateral relationships you have.\u201d\nThe visit gave substance to the American view of the reinvigorated relationship with Russia. While Russian leaders are willing to cooperate on arms control and the military effort in Afghanistan, they see American policy on Russia\u2019s borders as the real test of whether Washington is taking a new approach. Mr. Biden laid out a different vision: as other cooperative ventures with Russia proceed, he said, competition in the post-Soviet regions will fade away \u2014 to the benefit of everyone, including Georgia and Ukraine.\n\u201cThe more substantive relationship we have with Moscow, the more we can defuse the zero-sum thinking about our relations with Russia\u2019s neighbors,\u201d he said.\nIn Moscow, a Foreign Ministry spokesman called on the United States to consider the historical and cultural ties between Russia and its post-Soviet neighbors. The spokesman, Andrei Nesterenko, said it was Ukraine\u2019s sovereign right to choose its allies, but he noted that \u201cit is important that this is implemented transparently, without any \u2018backdoor games\u2019 and not at the cost of somebody else\u2019s interests.\u201d\nIn a briefing after the talks here, Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser, said he hoped that Russia would view American policy as an effort to build a \u201cmultipartner world\u201d and to shore up the stability of the entire region.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to build our own sphere of influence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe partnerships aren\u2019t being built against anyone. They\u2019re being built for the purpose of addressing common challenges that Russia also faces.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any guarantee that that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to play out,\u201d he added. In truth, NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine seems far off. Mr. Yushchenko, an emphatically pro-Western leader who has championed NATO membership, is not expected to win a presidential election in January. The front-runners, Yulia V. Tymoshenko and Viktor F. Yanukovich, are less enthusiastic about NATO membership, as is much of Ukraine\u2019s population.\nA senior American official said Ukraine had not always shown an eagerness for NATO membership or an American-led military modernization. In June, the United States canceled a military exercise planned with Ukraine because the Parliament did not pass legislation required to authorize the exercise. A similar parliamentary vote was shelved in 2006, amid anti-American and anti-NATO protests.\nThe push for NATO accession has been more central in Georgia, where Mr. Biden is scheduled to visit Wednesday. Georgia has been seeking muscular advocacy from the United States and Europe since the war last August.\nBut the war hurt Georgia\u2019s prospects for joining NATO, with some members, especially Germany, flatly opposing it as unnecessarily provocative to Russia.\nOn Sunday, President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia told The Wall Street Journal that hopes of joining NATO were \u201calmost dead.\u201d Georgian officials said that Mr. Saakashvili had been quoted incompletely; they told the local media that his real message was that \u201cif Russia reached its goal and managed to block the chances of Georgia to join the alliance, it would be a great tragedy for our country.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/world/europe/22biden.html", "title": "Biden Says U.S. Still Backs Ukraine in NATO", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}

He later died of his wounds.\nWhile that version of the events was itself deeply embarrassing for the Iraqi security forces, a statement issued Saturday afternoon by the Interior Ministry, which acknowledged a \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d before the shooting, countered news media reports that the officer, Maj. Arkan Hachim, was killed because his investigation was rattling powerful political forces.\nAccording to the statement, the suspect managed to wrestle a weapon from one of his guards as he was being given water. The officer was shot, and as the officer fell to the ground, Major Hachim moved to disarm the suspect and was shot in a struggle, dying later at the hospital, the statement said.\nThere were competing versions of the events, highlighting divisions among the security forces. When asked Friday about the shooting, the spokesman for the Baghdad Operation Command, which oversees security in the capital, said Major Hachim was not involved in investigating the bombings.\nAt the height of the sectarian violence, a separate command center for security in Baghdad was set up, putting the forces more directly under the control of the prime minister. The Interior Ministry, which controls the police, and the Defense Ministry provide the officers and soldiers to patrol the city, but they do not have ultimate authority.\nThe situation is further complicated because the interior minister, Jawad al-Bolani, is planning to challenge Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki in national elections scheduled for January.\nCorruption remains endemic, and following last week\u2019s bombings, 61 members of the security forces were arrested.\nThe details surrounding the shooting of Major Hachim remain murky.\nA fellow officer in Major Hachim\u2019s major crimes unit, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press, said the suspect had seized an AK-47 that had been left in the room.\nIn Samarra, where Major Hachim was buried Saturday, relatives said they believed that he was killed because his inquiry had uncovered evidence that at least one of the car bombs had been assembled in Baghdad\u2019s heavily fortified Green Zone.\n\u201cThere is an obvious negligence by the security agencies,\u201d said Waleed Shareka, a member of Parliament who sits on the Security and Defense Committee. \u201cHow could they bring a criminal accused of the Sunday bombings in without his hands being cuffed?

The Pakistani military is also preparing an offensive in South Waziristan, the rugged mountainous tribal region straddling the border with Afghanistan.\nThe bus was ferrying over two dozen people after work hours through Rawalpindi, the garrison city adjacent to the capital. At the time of the attack, the bus was idling at a busy traffic intersection called Choor Chowk, near the Westridge neighborhood of Rawalpindi.\nWhile the bus was owned by the Kahuta Research Laboratories, the main facility for uranium enrichment in the country, it did not seem to have been coming directly from the plant, and no high-ranking officials appeared to be onboard, the police said.\nRawalpindi is home to the headquarters of Pakistan\u2019s military. Installations of military and intelligence organizations there have been targets in the past.\nRawalpindi police officials said it was virtually impossible to check every vehicle and motorcycle entering the city.\n\u201cA moving target was attacked,\u201d Nasir Khan Durrani, the Regional Police Officer of Rawalpindi, told reporters at the site of the blast. \u201cThey have used a new method, using a motorbike.\u201d\nThe target was selected because of traffic congestion, with the intent to cause maximum damage, Mr. Durrani said.\nAt the site of the attack, several vehicles lay damaged and charred. The left side of the bus was badly damaged, and its windows were blown apart. Police officials said they believed they had recovered the bomber\u2019s remains.\nThey said that they believed the bomber had tried to strike the left side of the bus near the fuel tank. However, the bus did not catch fire after the blast. A commuter van and a cab with shattered windows lay by the side of the road. Shards of glass were scattered about. There were blood stains on the seats of the bus and other damaged vehicles.\nThe blast shattered glass of nearby buildings and created panic in the neighborhood.\nLt. Gen. Talat Masood, a military and political analyst based in Islamabad, said the terrorists were now opting for high-profile but softer targets.\n\u201cIt is quite possible that the attacker knew which facility the bus belonged to,\u201d Mr. Masood said. \u201cSecurity is very tough in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, but it is not possible for the government to provide security to soft targets like buses and vehicles on the road.\u201d\nAlthough police officials in Rawalpindi termed the attack involving a motorcycle as a new tactic, a similar attack was carried out two years ago.\nOn Nov. 1, 2007, a suicide attacker on a motorbike rammed into a Pakistan Air Force bus carrying officers and trainees near an Air Force base in Sargodha, in eastern Punjab Province.\nIn recent attacks, militants have used pickups and explosive-laden vehicles while singling out government and military installations. Motorcycles have also been used in a number of recent insurgent attacks in Iraq.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/world/asia/03pstan.html", "title": "Bomber Strikes Government Bus in Pakistan", "author": "SALMAN MASOOD"}
{"date": "Sat, 25 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 In more peaceful times, the narrow, sandy strip of land that hugs the coast near the northeastern town of Mullaittivu might attract tourists to its Indian Ocean beaches.\nNow, as the country\u2019s long-running civil war appears to be reaching its climax, a picture of desperation is emerging from the sliver of territory between a lagoon and the sea where rebels from the ethnic Tamil minority are making their last stand.\nStories of suffering have streamed out of the area along with the tens of thousands of civilians who were able to break through the front lines last week and straggle into overwhelmed hospitals and refugee camps.\nTim Pruchnic, an American surgeon working at a hospital in the northern town of Vavuniya, said in a telephone interview that many of his patients were so weak they were dying after operations that would not normally be life threatening.\nAfter months in the combat zone, patients are exhausted, malnourished and dehydrated, said Dr. Pruchnic, who works with the aid group Doctors Without Borders. Another doctor who works with the aid group at the same hospital, Paul McMaster, said some of his patients were losing limbs to amputations because their injuries \u2014 often from shrapnel, gunshots and land mines \u2014 had gone untreated for too long and became infected.\nCivilians have been trying for weeks and sometimes months to leave the ever-shrinking area of fighting between the government and the Tamil Tiger rebels in the north, but the rebels have been holding them as human shields, building earthen barriers that make it harder not only for soldiers to get in but also for civilians to get out, according to aid agencies and the Sri Lankan military. The rebels have also forced some civilians to take up arms, the United Nations says. The government, meanwhile, has ignored appeals from the United Nations, India, the United States and other nations for a cease-fire until all the civilians are out of the combat zone.\nLast week, the government was able to explode one of the rebels\u2019 barriers, allowing about 100,000 civilians to flee.\n\u201cEven in ordinary times a population of 100,000 would be a huge burden on the health system,\u201d said Gordon Weiss, the United Nations spokesman in Colombo. \u201cBut these are people who have had three months with very little food, they\u2019ve traveled across mine fields and endured months of shelling and small-arms fire. It\u2019s no surprise that the hospitals are overwhelmed.\u201d\nShortages of doctors and nurses are also growing severe, in part because of what Mr. Weiss described as bureaucratic \u201cbottlenecks\u201d in the approval process for visas of foreign aid workers.\nSome of the civilians who have fled ended up in the hospital at Vavuniya, where doctors say the maximum capacity is normally 600 patients. Last week, 1,700 people were crowded into its wards. Dr. Pruchnic said many of the patients, including children, arrived without their families.\n\u201cThere are kids here who have had amputations, their mother and father are gone \u2014 their whole family is missing,\u201d he said. \u201cYet they can still smile. I\u2019m amazed at their resilience.\u201d\nOn Saturday, the Tigers said that tens of thousands of civilians faced \u201cimminent\u201d starvation, according to a Web site that serves as their voice, Tamilnet.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which evacuated hundred of wounded civilians by fishing boats used as ferries in recent days, has also warned of the lack of food and an \u201cacute shortage of vital medical supplies\u201d in the combat zone.\nThe government\u2019s advance has been slowed somewhat by the rebels\u2019 earthen barriers, according to Brig. Gen. Udaya Nanayakkara, a military spokesman. He said the military was now moving forward only several yards a day as troops cleared mines and booby traps. The rebels are equipped with at least one tank, artillery pieces, armor-plated vehicles, assault weapons and satellite phones, he said.\nConditions in the rebel-held territory are difficult to verify because journalists and aid workers have been barred from the combat zone.\nThe general also said the mingling of rebels among civilians had complicated the military\u2019s advance.\nAmong the nearly 200,000 people who have escaped rebel-held territory since January, about 3,000 were determined to be fighters disguised as civilians, General Nanayakkara said. He estimates there are 500 fighters left in rebel-held territory.\n\u201cThe moment we take all the trapped civilians out it\u2019s just a matter of 48 hours to get rid of them,\u201d General Nanayakkara said of the rebels.\nSince late January, when rebel-held territory shrank significantly, about 13,500 civilians have been killed and 14,000 wounded, according to a United Nations tally. The United Nations estimates there are 50,000 to 100,000 civilians stuck on the sandy spit of land. The military says it is more like 15,000 people.\nWhatever the number, the frailest among them may never make it out alive.\nPatients arriving at Vavuniya hospital are usually young or middle-aged: Dr. Pruchnic says he has seen few elderly people.\n\u201cThe old don\u2019t seem to make it here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a few.

Dozens of people were also reportedly buried beneath a landslide that was triggered by the quake in Cianjur, about 60 miles south of the capital, Jakarta.\nOfficials said Thursday it remained difficult to determine the extent of damage because communications had been knocked out in a number of coastal villages.\nThe earthquake was felt throughout Java, where half of Indonesia\u2019s 240 million people live, and as far away as the resort island of Bali.\nMany Indonesians feared a possible repeat of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in 2004 that killed some 170,000 people in the country\u2019s northernmost province of Aceh.\nThat quake, with a 9.1 magnitude, struck off the western coast of northern Sumatra and created tsunamis that rolled across Aceh and into the Indian Ocean.

Since then, Indonesia has been hit by 29 quakes of 6.3 magnitude or higher.\nA tsunami warning issued minutes after the quake on Wednesday was quickly canceled.\nIndonesia\u2019s state news agency reported that the tsunami early warning system installed following the 2004 tsunami failed to work in several areas along Java\u2019s coast following Wednesday\u2019s earthquake.\nIn Jakarta, residents fled office towers, shopping centers and some apartment buildings on Wednesday, causing major traffic jams. Health officials said at least 27 people in Jakarta had been injured, mostly from being trampled by panicked residents.\nRegional earthquakes are often felt in Jakarta, but residents of the capital were especially spooked Wednesday because of the apparent force and duration of the tremors.\nThe city\u2019s mayor, Fauzi Bowo, ordered an immediate safety review of 700 of the capital\u2019s high-rise buildings.\nThe city of Tasikmalaya was closest to the epicenter, seismologists said, and officials at the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the city\u2019s heavily populated districts were among the most damaged areas, along with the nearby towns of Garut and Cianjur.

He faced Rodrigo \u00c1vila, a former national police chief, who was Arena\u2019s candidate.\nWorkers from the F.M.L.N. gathered in the Sheraton Hotel and chanted \u201cYes, we could\u201d as Mr. Funes came out to speak.\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new stage in our history now that candidates from the left have reached the presidency and the vice presidency,\u201d Mr. Funes said.\nMr. \u00c1vila had not yet conceded defeat.\nThe vote had been calm Sunday, with a strong turnout among the 4.3 million registered voters.\nF.M.L.N. supporters rode to the polls in this capital city in the backs of rickety pickup trucks, waving red F.M.L.N. flags. Minivans painted in Arena\u2019s red, white and blue took its supporters to vote.\n\u201cWe want to change this system so it benefits the whole population and not just those with money,\u201d said Victor Manuel Saenz, 53, a street vendor who wore a bright red shirt in the style of old-school Latin revolutionaries.\nWith the end of the civil war in 1992, the F.M.L.N. became a political party.

{"date": "Tue, 05 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Iraq\u2019s main anticorruption watchdog has no shortage of cases, as its new report makes clear: embezzlement of $80 million; tampering with government tea imports; the theft of 50 Italian-made Beretta pistols; procuring forged Ph.D.\u2019s; and scores of other crimes.\nThe real problem is the difficulty of prosecuting people for corruption, which is so widespread that it has become one of the main obstacles to stability and progress in Iraq, according to Iraqi and American officials. Among the barriers, the officials say, are laws that give ministers the right to pardon offenders, as well as partisan and sectarian interference, pressure, infighting, vendettas, blackmail and death threats.\n\u201cThe reason for the massive corruption in Iraq is the belief by the corrupt that they are shielded from prosecution by the protection afforded to them by their political parties and sects,\u201d said Rahim al-Okaili, the commissioner of the anticorruption group, the Commission on Public Integrity.\nIraq\u2019s culture of impunity on corruption was illustrated last week when commission officials, accompanied by Iraqi soldiers, went to the Trade Ministry \u2014 itself far from the most-accused ministry on the commission\u2019s list \u2014 to arrest nine people, including two of the minister\u2019s brothers. They were implicated in large-scale embezzlement and fraud related to the ministry\u2019s $5.3 billion public ration program.\nA firefight erupted between the ministry\u2019s guards, led by one of the minister\u2019s brothers, and the force sent to make the arrests. That unit retreated after arresting only one of the people who were wanted, the minister\u2019s spokesman.\nThe trade minister, Falah al-Sudani, belongs to a wing of the Shiite Dawa Party of the prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. The ministry issued statements saying the charges were baseless and stemmed from tips by disgruntled former employees, who had been fired because they were corrupt.\nThe Trade Ministry controls some valuable commodities in Iraq, operates the program to provide monthly rations for all Iraqis and supervises the importing of cars. It also oversees the importing of grain, seeds and construction materials.\nThere were 99 corruption cases initiated last year against employees of the Trade Ministry, according to a copy of the Integrity Commission\u2019s report that was provided to The New York Times in advance of its official release next week. That put the Trade Ministry 10th among government ministries and institutions.\nComing in first, with 736 cases, was the Interior Ministry, followed by the Municipalities and Public Works Ministry, with 400 cases, and the Justice Ministry, with 249.\nLast year the commission received 5,031 complaints, of which 3,027 were referred to the courts, resulting in 97 convictions.\nSome of the cases ending in conviction, as listed in the report, provide insight into the range and depth of corruption in Iraqi government institutions.\nThe Interior Ministry cases include stealing weapons, ammunition and vehicles, and forging passports and identification cards.\nEight members of provincial councils, including four chairmen, were sentenced to two-year prison terms in connection with fraud in public works.\nThere were also 317 candidates running in January\u2019s provincial elections who presented false credentials and degrees.\nAn unidentified official in the Defense Ministry was sentenced in absentia to a 10-year prison term for embezzling $80 million.\nPerhaps more telling were the cases dismissed in the past few years as a result of a government amnesty and a law dating to 1971 that allows ministers to grant immunity to subordinates accused of corruption. The United States is pressing the Iraqi government to repeal that law.\nLast year, 1,552 corruption cases involving 2,772 officials were dismissed as a result of the amnesty. Seven of the 1,552 involved corruption worth almost $50 million at the Electricity Ministry.\nSince 2005, corruption charges have been brought against five ministers, who either were acquitted or fled the country.\nThe commission itself, which was created in January 2004 by the American-led occupation authority, has not escaped scrutiny.\nCommissioner Okaili bemoans that his own institution is riddled with corruption and cronyism. He said dozens of employees had been dismissed for falsifying their university credentials and acquiring personal vehicles and unlicensed weapons with internal funds.\nSeparately, Iraq\u2019s Foreign Ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador, Hassan Kazimi Qomi, to protest a series of airstrikes Iran had made over two days on villages in Iraqi Kurdistan.\nThe ministry said in a statement that the strikes had caused significant material damage and wounded several villagers. The statement called for an immediate halt to the strikes.\nA security official in Iraqi Kurdistan said that the strikes were aimed at Iranian Kurdish guerrillas from the Party for Free Life of Kurdistan, or P.J.A.K., operating on the Iraqi side and that they were in retaliation for an ambush against Iranian government forces.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/world/middleeast/06iraq.html", "title": "Iraqi Report on Corruption Cites Prosecutors\u2019 Barriers", "author": "SAM DAGHER"}

President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is expected to seek re-election.\n\u201cThe most important goal is to prevent Mr. Ahmadinejad from re-election, not to get Mr. Khatami elected,\u201d Mr. Leylaz said. \u201cThe chances of getting a reformist president elected would decrease if we have several candidates running.\u201d\nIn the meeting on Sunday, Mr. Khatami told campaign staff members that Mr. Moussavi might stand a better chance of winning than he would, the Mehr news agency reported.\n\u201cOpponents want to divide my supporters and supporters of Moussavi,\u201d Mr. Khatami was quoted as saying. \u201cIt is not in our interest. Also, some conservatives are supporting Moussavi.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMoussavi is popular and will be able to execute his plans, and I prefer he stays in the race.\u201d\nMr. Leylaz said that Mr. Moussavi\u2019s announcement to run came unexpectedly last week, even though Mr. Khatami had consulted with him before announcing his own bid for the office on Feb. 8. Before the announcement, Mr. Khatami had said that he would run only if Mr. Moussavi did not, to avoid diluting the reformist vote.\n\u201cMr. Khatami was offended and felt betrayed,\u201d Mr. Leylaz said.\nMr. Khatami, 65, won a landslide victory in 1997 and was in office for two terms until 2005. A charismatic leader, he was expected to draw considerable support in the coming election. More than 20,000 supporters showed up at his speech last week in the southern city of Shiraz, despite government restrictions.\nBut Mr. Khatami also has strong enemies among politicians who oppose more political and social openness. His reform agenda, which included an easing of tensions with the West, suffered major setbacks when he was in office. Powerful hard-line institutions blocked many of his efforts, and many of his allies were jailed.\nMr. Moussavi was the country\u2019s prime minister from 1980 to 1988. He is well remembered by many Iranians for managing the country during its eight-year war with Iraq. His presidential platform is not yet clear, but in the past he supported protectionist economic policies.\nMr. Moussavi, who is also a painter and architect, stayed out of politics for the past two decades and had turned down calls to run for president in previous elections. Mr. Ahmadinejad is supported by the conservative Iranian establishment, but his economic policies have unleashed inflation of over 25 percent, and two major setbacks last week suggested that he might be losing support ahead of elections.\nLast week, Parliament rejected a major element of his proposed budget to cut energy subsidies and to distribute the money directly among the poor. Another reformist candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, has said that he will remain in the race.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/world/middleeast/17iran.html", "title": "Reform Candidate Withdraws in Iran", "author": "NAZILA FATHI"}
{"date": "Tue, 26 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In dealing with North Korea, American officials are reduced to studying two-month-old photographs of its reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il, to calculate how long he is likely to live. The new administration\u2019s North Korea team includes a special emissary who works part time as an academic dean and a State Department official who has yet to be confirmed by Congress.\nAnd as President Obama tries to find a way to punish North Korea for its latest nuclear test and missile launchings, his senior aides acknowledge that every policy option employed by previous presidents over the past dozen years \u2014 whether hard or soft, political or economic \u2014 has been fruitless in stopping North Korea from building a nuclear weapon.\n\u201cAs much as they understood this was going to be an issue, they weren\u2019t ready for a nuclear test in May,\u201d Marcus Noland, an expert on North Korea at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said of Mr. Obama and his advisers. \u201cThey\u2019re in a situation now where they have to contain and manage a crisis.\u201d\nThat crisis, officials and independent experts said, is all the more treacherous because of the deep political uncertainty in North Korea. American officials say they believe that Mr. Kim, in rapidly declining health, is maneuvering to make his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, his successor, perhaps after a period in which his brother-in-law, Jang Seong-taek, would serve as a regent.\nThe nuclear test and the test-firing of six short-range missiles, the American officials said, must be understood within the context of this internal struggle to extend the Kim dynasty\u2019s rule for another generation.\nBut they warn that the information coming out of North Korea is frustratingly vague and inconclusive. Mr. Kim, officials noted, skipped a recent meeting with Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov. Chatter about the health of Mr. Kim has spiked in Beijing and in Seoul, where North Korea-watching is an obsession.\nEven a recent official photo of Mr. Kim, which shows him alive but feeble, is open to conflicting interpretations, an official said: it may be that North Korea wants to show that he is still in control, or it may be that it is signaling that the end is near and appealing for help in a perilous transition.\n\u201cPeople who tell you they know what\u2019s going on there don\u2019t know,\u201d said one official, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cWhat\u2019s undeniable is that there are substantial challenges to all the previous approaches to North Korea.\u201d\nOf the options still on the table, the measures that the Obama administration seems most drawn to would constrain the North Korean government\u2019s access to funds. These steps, which would be carried out by the Treasury Department either openly or covertly, would be directed at banks in Europe and the Middle East that are used by the Kim family, officials said.\nThe administration may also raise its pressure on China and South Korea to cut off investments in North Korea \u2014 a delicate task, given Beijing\u2019s reluctance to appear to bow to American influence.\nFinally, the United States and South Korea could start boarding ships traveling to and from North Korea that they suspect are carrying nuclear technology. But American officials said they were wary of doing that because of the risk of a military confrontation.\nThe United States, experts say, has little choice but to continue negotiating with North Korea through the six-nation process, which also includes South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. The Obama administration may have to dispense with the usual bag of carrots and sticks, however.\n\u201cThe North Korean leadership cares about internal matters, not external matters,\u201d said Wendy R. Sherman, who coordinated North Korea policy in the Clinton administration. \u201cThey care about external matters only insofar as it helps ensure the survival of the regime.\u201d\nUnder those circumstances, she said, North Korea is not likely to be receptive to incentives. And it may have concluded that having nuclear weapons is a necessity for its own preservation. The detention of two American television journalists by North Korea injects another combustible element. The two journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, were arrested in March and charged with illegally entering the country with \u201chostile\u201d intent. Their trial, set for June 4, \u201cis a risk but also a possibility,\u201d depending on how the North handles the case, Ms. Sherman said.\nAll of this adds up to a formidable diplomatic challenge for the Obama administration, at a time when its energies are being consumed by Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran. North Korea lacks the high-powered attention that those countries are receiving.\nThe special representative for North Korea policy, Stephen W. Bosworth, is a well-regarded diplomat and a former ambassador to South Korea. But he divides his time between this assignment and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, where he is dean.\nKurt M. Campbell, an Asia security expert nominated to become the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, is likely to play a significant role. But he has not yet been confirmed.\nThe State Department spokesman, Ian C. Kelly, said Mr. Bosworth took part in meetings on North Korea by phone from New York on Monday and was in Washington on Tuesday. \u201cAmbassador Bosworth is fully engaged, full-time engaged,\u201d he said.\nAmong the other influential players on North Korea policy, officials said, are James B. Steinberg, deputy secretary of state, and Jeffrey A. Bader, senior director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council. Mr. Steinberg will attend a regional security conference in Singapore this week, where he will accompany Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to meetings with defense ministers from Japan and South Korea, the Pentagon said.\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first senior American official to speak openly about how a succession struggle would complicate dealings with North Korea, has worked the phones over the past three days.\nBut, officials said, it is ultimately Mr. Obama, a young president at the dawn of his administration, who will have to decide how to deal with Mr. Kim, an aging leader at the twilight of his.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/world/asia/27nuke.html", "title": "Leadership Mystery Amid North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Work", "author": "MARK LANDLER"}

He was traveling to the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, to visit his family for the Afghan New Year. The bomb hit the car only a few miles from its destination, officials said, and may have been remotely detonated. All five in the car were killed instantly.\nMr. Khan, known for mistreating the Taliban fighters he captured while he was provincial intelligence chief, would have been a prime target of insurgents. But no group initially claimed responsibility, and the road where he was killed is generally dangerous for foreign forces and other travelers. Despite the presence of 8,000 British troops in Helmand, much of the province is under Taliban control.\nMr. Khan served as intelligence chief from 2001 until his election to Parliament in 2005. He was from the town of Sangin, a center of the opium and heroin trade, where powerful smugglers have allied with Taliban forces to protect their illicit business. Mr. Khan was allied to a former governor of Helmand accused of involvement in the drug trade.\nBecause of the many enemies he made during his harsh campaign against local Taliban members, Mr. Khan had not returned to his home district since 2006, when the Taliban staged a strong comeback in the region.\nIn June 2006, 32 members of Mr. Khan\u2019s extended family, including two of his brothers and his son, were killed in an ambush one day by the Taliban. Mr. Khan was in Kabul at the time.\nHe is the second Helmand legislator to have been killed by Taliban fighters since the establishment of Parliament in 2005. In November 2007, Abdul Mateen, the other Helmand legislator to be killed, died along with five other Parliament members in a suicide attack in Baghlan Province that killed more than 70 people.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/world/asia/20helmand.html", "title": "Afghan Legislator Killed in Bomb Attack", "author": "ABDUL WAHEED WAFA"}

The woman, Umm Assad al-Khafaji, whose son Assad Raad al-Khafaji had saved the baby, cleaned him up, dressed him in pajamas that belonged to one of her granddaughters and fed him milk from a bottle. The jean overalls he had worn hours earlier were stained with blood.\nThe baby smiled as he looked around the Khafajis\u2019 living room.\nFor Mrs. Khafaji, the baby was a miracle and a gift from heaven. For people in the Nawab section of the Kadhimiya district in Baghdad, the Khafaji family and other neighbors were heroes. Their actions seemed to be proof that six years of numbing violence haven't dulled Iraqis' capacity for extraordinary acts of humanity.\n\u201cThe victims are Iraqis \u2014 how can we not aid and defend them?\u201d asked Sadiq Khalaf al-Maliki, 36, who had pulled the charred body of the woman presumed to be the baby\u2019s mother from the burning white Peugeot sedan they were riding in.\nAround noon on Tuesday, Mr. Maliki was on his way to fix his motorbike at one of the many repair shops that dot Nawab Street in Kadhimiya, the predominantly Shiite district in northwestern Baghdad that is home to a revered Shiite shrine.\nSuddenly, a large explosion went off a few hundred yards from him. A car bomber had been waiting in line at a police checkpoint before abandoning his explosives-packed vehicle, according to a police colonel and witnesses. In addition to the eight dead, at least 20 people were wounded.\nIgnoring the risk of a second bomb, Mr. Maliki rushed to aid the victims.\nHe said he saw the dead and injured everywhere, including an old woman sprawled on the median screaming: \u201cI want Abbas. Where is my son?\u201d\nHe then made his way to a Peugeot that was on fire. Inside he saw the driver slumped at the wheel, dead, and a folded stroller in the seat next to him.\nIn the back lay a woman\u2019s charred body next to a colorful baby blanket.\nMinutes earlier, Mr. Khafaji, who repairs motorbikes, had rushed to the same car, reached for the baby through an open window and taken him to his home nearby.\nIn that sense, the baby was luckier than others who had been wounded in the bombing. After Iraqi security forces arrived, they fired shots to disperse the crowd and scuffled with some of the rescuers, witnesses said, preventing many of the wounded from getting help. Order was restored when American troops arrived, witnesses said.\nIssa Salim, a minivan driver, said lives could have been saved if it were not for the chaos that ensued. He said that he saw a man walk away from his car, bleeding, and that the man was dead by the time an ambulance reached him.\nThe Khafajis, meanwhile, called a number on the Peugeot driver\u2019s cellphone and established that the man was not the baby\u2019s father but a taxi driver hired by the woman.\nThey had none of the woman\u2019s possessions to help them track down the baby\u2019s family.\nMrs. Khafaji and her son, a burly and bearded 26-year-old, gazed at the oblivious baby in her arms and started crying.\n\u201cWhat future will this baby have without his mother?\u201d she said.\n\u201cMany Iraqi children have been orphaned.

He had just finished a six-mile protest walk with about 15 friends to raise support for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip when he was detained for hours and then hustled into an unmarked van and driven off. He has not been seen or heard from since.\nFor two days the authorities denied that he was being held. Then on Sunday, at 10 p.m., a security official at the American University in Cairo, where Mr. Rizk studies, was able to confirm his arrest to his family. His mother and father tried to get some sleep, but at 1 a.m., security agents showed up at their door, five plainclothesmen and two guards carrying automatic weapons.\nAfter searching their apartment, the security agents tried to take his father, Magid, away, too. He refused to go, and the authorities backed off when representatives of the German Embassy and Amnesty International arrived in the middle of the night. Philip Rizk\u2019s mother, Judith, is German, and he has dual Egyptian-German citizenship.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a bad movie,\u201d Mrs. Rizk said.\nThe war in Gaza has left its mark in Egypt. The authorities here have been increasingly frustrated with criticism at home and abroad for refusing to fully open the border between Rafah and Gaza.\nNow, according to the accounts of five witnesses to Mr. Rizk\u2019s arrest, and interviews with his parents, his sisters, human rights lawyers and some of his professors, it appears that the Egyptian authorities have turned to the country\u2019s emergency law to silence criticism of its Gaza policy. The law, adopted to combat terrorism after President Anwar el-Sadat was gunned down in 1981, allows the government to detain people without charge and effectively eliminates any right to due process.\nThe government acknowledges holding about 1,800 prisoners without charge under the emergency law, but human rights groups say the number could be closer to 10,000. The law is routinely used against members of the Muslim Brotherhood, a banned but tolerated social and political movement. Dozens of Brotherhood followers have been arrested since the start of the Gaza conflict.\n\u201cOfficially, nobody knows where Philip is,\u201d said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, deputy director in the Middle East and North Africa for Amnesty International. \u201cPhilip has disappeared.\u201d\nA spokesman for Egypt\u2019s Interior Ministry, which handles all matters of internal security, was furious at being asked about the case. The spokesman is a general, but talked only on the condition that he not be identified by name because of the security nature of his work. He declined to answer questions, and said: \u201cThis happened within the framework of the Egyptian law. You can go to the office of the general prosecutor. I have no information about Philip. Who said they don\u2019t know where he is? What is the secret behind the interest of The New York Times in Philip? Are you working for human rights organizations?\u201d\nThe general was angry; the Rizk family was terrified.\nJudith and Magid Rizk live in a small, neat apartment, in a rare quiet section of Cairo. Mr. Rizk is a small book publisher, a man who wears starched white shirts and sweater vests. He is not a political man. But he said he supported his son\u2019s interests in social causes. \u201cThis is his niche, his passion,\u201d Mr. Rizk said. He does not want to antagonize the authorities. He said he just wanted his son back in time for his birthday.\nPhilip Rizk turns 27 on Thursday.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where he is; we have not talked to him. We don\u2019t know if he is eating, if he is sleeping; we don\u2019t know what they are doing to him,\u201d Mrs. Rizk said. She was tired, scared and, after having lived her adult life in Egypt, stunned that men with machine guns and riot gear had come to her door. The family started a Facebook page to gather and publicize pleas for his release.\nMr. Rizk appears tall and thin as he walks through the scenes of a 28-minute movie he made, \u201cThe Palestinian Life, Village Stories.\u201d After he graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois with a degree in philosophy, he moved to Gaza to work with an Anglican charity. He lived there for two years, and during that time made his rather somber documentary of average Palestinians trying to survive. \u201cI found that because violence makes news, the stories of ordinary people never get out,\u201d he said in the introduction. His film, he said, celebrated samud, or the steadfastness, of the Palestinians.\nWhen he returned to Cairo, he enrolled in a master\u2019s program in Middle East studies at the university. He also joined a group in Cairo called the Popular Committee in Solidarity With the Palestinian People. It was a left-leaning group of mostly young activists. About a month ago, the group decided to stage a symbolic march to Gaza. About half of the participants were Egyptian and half foreign.\nThe group met Friday morning and took a bus north from Cairo to the Qalyubiya governate, an hour away. The demonstrators walked for about two hours, waving Palestinian flags and talking with local residents.\nMr. Rizk carried a handwritten sign in Arabic reading: \u201cWe are fed up. Open the Rafah border.\u201d\nWhen the walk was over, the marchers climbed into small buses or their own cars for the ride back to Cairo and were quickly detained. Witnesses described being surrounded by large numbers of police officers for about four hours and being promised that everything was routine and that they would be released soon. A human rights lawyer arrived. The marchers were taken to a local police department and told that their passports would be copied and that they would then be released.\nAt that point, the police asked to speak to Mr. Rizk. After some negotiating he agreed to enter the police station with the lawyer, but the police distracted the lawyer and hustled Mr. Rizk out a back door. He managed to phone his friends, who said they threw themselves in front of the van he was in, but were pulled off by the police. Three members of the group chased the van in their car for more than half an hour, until they were stopped at a roadblock.\nSecurity police officers started visiting the homes and offices of other young people involved in the trip. Sarah Carr, a dual British-Egyptian citizen and reporter for the English-language Daily News, who covered the event, was too afraid to go home, or to work after hearing that the police had inquired about her. Katharine Hall, 20, of Britain, was sitting in a cafe in downtown Cairo when her roommate phoned to tell her that the police had come to their door. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be, and I am not telling you,\u201d Ms. Hall said as her cheeks flushed red. \u201cThey are trying to scare me. So I don\u2019t want them to find me.\u201d She left the cafe.\nOn Sunday, about 50 students and faculty members at the American University in Cairo\u2019s campus held a small demonstration calling on the authorities to release Mr. Rizk. The signs they held up said, \u201cWhere is Philip?\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/world/middleeast/10egypt.html", "title": "Van Spirits Away Protester in Egypt, Signaling Crackdown on Criticism Over Gaza", "author": "MICHAEL SLACKMAN"}
{"date": "Wed, 13 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PARIS \u2014 You can\u2019t blame Bernard Kouchner, the foreign minister of France, for being confused. A Socialist in the cabinet of a center-right government, Mr. Kouchner hesitated when asked what party would get his vote in next month\u2019s elections for the European Parliament.\nIn the end, he plumped for the party of President Nicolas Sarkozy. He won\u2019t be the only European moving to the right. The elections in early June are likely to be remembered for two things: how well fringe parties will do in an anxious period of economic recession, and how few Europeans will bother to vote.\nOnly 34 percent of the some 380 million eligible Europeans say they will probably vote, while 15 percent say they will not vote in any circumstances, according to the latest Eurobarometer poll. The numbers are worst where the extreme right is expected to do well, with only 22 percent of Britons admitting they will probably vote (while 30 percent say they won\u2019t) and only 13 percent of Poles. Even in Greece, where voting is mandatory, only 48 percent say they will probably cast ballots.\n\u201cThe danger is that those who do bother, vote for the more radical elements,\u201d said Thomas Klau of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Given the economic crisis, he said, there is \u201ca degree of voter indifference, which is a reflection of the lack of political leadership we have seen.\u201d\nEuropeans will choose a Parliament for the seventh time in 30 years, but turnout has fallen with each enlargement and each election, from 62 percent in 1979 to 48 percent in 2004 \u2014 roughly 20 percent lower than in corresponding national parliamentary elections.\nThe reasons for the Euro-apathy are much debated. As the only directly elected European institution, the Parliament has real power and is likely to get more. It can amend or reject proposals for new laws from the European Commission, which runs the bureaucracy. Few Europeans realize it, but the bulk of their legislation on issues like the environment, consumer rights and transport is made in this way, rather than in national capitals.\nThe 785-member Parliament can also fire the European Commission and has joint control with member countries over the E.U. budget, which in 2009 is some 133.8 billion euros, or $182 billion.\nBut it cannot initiate legislation. It is one of the few democratic parliaments in the world that does not elect a government, instead operating a Byzantine multinational party structure. Power is wielded by voting blocs with vaguely similar ideological identities and strange names and symbols, which few ordinary Europeans recognize.\nThe Socialists at least have their rose, surrounded by the circle of 12 stars from the European flag, but the currently dominant center-right grouping employs a blue heart around the stars, while the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, a mouthful on its own, uses the stars, rather lopsided, around what appears to be two stick figures whose heads are being lopped off.\nAnd because the election is done by proportional representation on party lists, most Europeans cannot identify their member of the European Parliament. Most people vote in large geographical regions for which voters have no affinity.\nMany deputies are \u201cselected by an opaque process so they end up being anonymous even before they start,\u201d said Pat Cox, a former president of the Parliament.\nIt is not just that excitement is missing, or a sense of direct voter contact with a legislator. Even worse, there is disenchantment with the way that European institutions have responded to the global economic meltdown. In general, except for the European Central Bank, which controls the euro currency, the European Commission is considered to have been weak and reactive, overshadowed by the actions of individual governments.\nThe apathy of the middle means that the fringes and extremes will do better. Small but significant gains are expected across the Continent for the Greens and for the far-left \u2014 from Germany with Die Linke, to Portugal and its Marxist Bloco de Esquerda. In Britain, there is concern that the far-right, anti-immigration British National Party will win its first European seat. In the Netherlands, the party of Geert Wilders, a prominent critic of Islam, is expected to do well while the anti-immigration Danish People\u2019s Party is also likely to gain.\nThe president of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering, a center-right Christian Democrat from Germany, blames the media for focusing on national issues. \u201cIn political talk shows, the parliamentarians of the country are invited and almost never Eurodeputies, even though the subjects discussed \u2014 questions of economy, environment, terrorism \u2014 concern European legislation,\u201d he told Le Monde.\nAsked if the members of the European Parliament themselves could be to blame, given a recent study showing high absenteeism, he said: \u201cThis study is completely false.\u201d\nMr. Cox is not so sure. He is dismayed by what he calls the \u201czero visibility\u201d of these elections and believes politicians could do more. \u201cIf politics wants to reach voters it has to use all the classic political methods of campaigning,\u201d said Mr. Cox, who now heads the European Movement, promoting European integration. \u201cYou cannot reach them out of institutions in Brussels.\u201d\nThe European Parliament itself has gone on the offensive, hiring public relations firms and working on a deal with MTV to appeal to young people, while putting up posters all over the 27 nations of the European Union with a version of the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s your choice!\u201d\nOn its Web site, the Parliament lists 10 reasons to vote, warning: \u201cIf you don\u2019t bother, somebody else will \u2014 and decide who represents you at the only directly elected Pan-European assembly.\u201d It admonishes: \u201cGet the Europe you want! If you don\u2019t vote, don\u2019t complain.\u201d Despite the lavish site, the English is slightly broken. \u201cYour M.E.P. is your voice in Europe \u2014 why would you let it go wasted?\u201d\nAfter one of the world\u2019s biggest exercises in democracy, few Europeans will notice the difference. No government will be kicked out and no new political course set. A study by three academics, called Predict09.eu, suggests that the center-right will remain the biggest group in the European Parliament, followed by the socialists and then the liberals. In other words, exactly the same as now.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/world/europe/14europe.html", "title": "Coming Vote on Assembly Elicits Shrugs in Europe", "author": "STEVEN ERLANGER and STEPHEN CASTLE"}

On Thursday, the authorities published the photographs of an additional 15 people, all but one of them Uighur, who they say had a hand in the unrest. Those who provide information leading to an arrest can collect as much as $7,350 in reward money.\n\u201cThe police urged the suspects to turn themselves in,\u201d China Daily wrote, quoting an unidentified law enforcement official. \u201cThose who do so within 10 days will be dealt with leniently, while others will be punished severely.\u201d\nIn the days after the riots, the head of the Communist Party in Urumqi was blunt about what awaits those convicted of the most serious offenses. \u201cTo those who have committed crimes with cruel means, we will execute them,\u201d said the official, Li Zhi.\nThe riots, the worst outbreak of ethnic strife in China\u2019s recent history, began July 5 after protests over the deaths of Uighur factory workers in another part of China turned into a murderous rampage. The violence, which lasted three days, claimed 197 lives, most of them Han Chinese beaten to death on the streets, according to the government. The Han are the dominant ethnic group in China.\nUighur advocates overseas, however, insist that the official death toll undercounts the number of Uighurs killed by the paramilitary police and during revenge attacks by the Han that followed the initial rioting.\nChina has accused outsiders of instigating the unrest, heaping most of the blame on Rebiya Kadeer, the 62-year-old leader of the World Uighur Congress, which advocates self-determination for China\u2019s Uighurs. They say Ms. Kadeer, a businesswoman who spent years in a Chinese jail before going into exile, organized the killings from her home in Washington.\nIn recent weeks Ms. Kadeer has been on an aggressive campaign to convince the world that her people are the primary victims of the rioting. During a visit to Japan on Wednesday, she told reporters that 10,000 people had disappeared overnight in the days following the unrest. \u201cWhere did they go?\u201d she asked. \u201cWere they all killed or sent somewhere? The Chinese government should disclose what happened to them.\u201d\nHer claims have infuriated China, with one official in Xinjiang describing her remarks as \u201ccompletely fabricated.\u201d Ms. Kadeer says she cannot reveal the source of her information because to do so would endanger those who provided it.\nIf the trials that followed the 2008 riots in Tibet are any guide, the court hearings in Xinjiang will be swift. According to China Daily, the accused will be appointed lawyers who have \u201creceived special training,\u201d as have the judges who will preside over the cases. Each trial will be heard by a panel of three or seven judges, and the majority opinion will prevail.\nHuman rights groups, however, say they have little confidence the tribunals will be fair. They expect the proceedings to be closed to the public, as are most trials in China, and they note that the defendants will not have lawyers of their own choosing.\n\u201cWithout independent legal counsel, you don\u2019t have any clue as to what evidence has been collected and through what means,\u201d said Renee Xia, international director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, which is based in Hong Kong. \u201cWere they tortured or coerced to confess? Trials can be speedy, but it doesn\u2019t mean they will be fair.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/world/asia/01china.html", "title": "China to Try Suspects Held After Riots", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}
{"date": "Thu, 10 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISTANBUL \u2014 A radical wing of the separatist Kurdish rebel group claimed responsibility for an attack last week that killed seven Turkish soldiers and injured three in an ambush near Tokat, a town in the north of the region of Anatolia.\nThe attack raised tensions in Turkey, where many people have grown weary of the armed conflict between the Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party, known as the P.K.K., and the Turkish Army that has left more than 40,000 people dead over more than a quarter-century.\nThe attack came as the government began considering democratic reforms that would advance the rights of Kurds and other minorities, including enhancing Kurdish cultural and social rights and permitting the use of the Kurdish language in national broadcast media and political campaigns. The reforms would be part of a plan to find a political solution to the long-running conflict.\nAccording to the Interior Ministry, 799 people were detained, 119 arrested and hundreds injured during pro-Kurdish demonstrations over the last week, after rumors circulated on the Internet that a leader of the P.K.K., Abdullah Ocalan, had been mistreated in prison, the Firat News Agency, a Kurdish news portal, reported Thursday.\nA constitutional court case that could result in the disbanding of the only Kurdish political party in Turkey would probably raise tensions and block a political solution to the conflict, political analysts said.\nThe court, which is considering whether the Kurdish party, the Democratic Society Party, had undermined national stability, was expected to reach a verdict soon.\nAlthough the party has been criticized for refusing to label the P.K.K. as a terrorist organization, as the United States, the European Union and Turkey have done, it did denounce the attack in Tokat this week, calling it an act of provocation to fuel anti-Kurdish sentiments.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/world/europe/11turkey.html", "title": "Kurdish Rebels Claim Ambush as Their Deed", "author": "SEBNEM ARSU"}

{"date": "Thu, 03 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TAISHAN, China \u2014 Hundreds, maybe thousands, of towers rise from the rice fields here in a tableau that is more Tuscan countryside than Chinese landscape.\nIt is a sight found nowhere else in China: rectangular towers, some made of concrete, some built of stone or other materials, jutting four or five stories high from the flatlands. They have balconies and turrets and Roman-style arches. There are metal shutters to keep out criminals and portholes where defenders can take aim at assailants, explaining why the locals call these buildings \u201cpao lou,\u201d or cannon towers.\nSo common are the towers that until just a few decades ago, virtually every town in this fertile patch of Guangdong Province, just west of Hong Kong, had one.\nMost were built in the early 20th century by overseas Chinese who returned from abroad with newfound wealth and an abiding fear of being parted from that wealth by bandits. So up went the fortress towers, an architectural amalgamation of Chinese mansion and European medieval castle.\nBut now the towers, built to withstand raids and storms, are crumbling, left to rot by the overseas Chinese families as forgotten relics of a bygone age.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of the overseas Chinese to donate these to the country,\u201d said Cai Hetian, director of the museum here in Taishan and an advocate for the preservation of the towers. \u201cThese are falling apart, and they\u2019re potentially dangerous.\u201d\nMr. Cai estimated that since the 1950s, about 3,000 towers have crumbled or been destroyed in Taishan, leaving about 2,000 standing today. Barely any of the oldest ones \u2014 village guard towers made of mud and earth and dating from the late Qing Dynasty, which ended in 1911 \u2014 are left.\nAlso in danger of disintegrating or being torn down are European-style market arcades scattered in towns across the region, and thousands of multistory villas called \u201cyang lou,\u201d or foreign buildings, that were built as fortified homes by returning Chinese. Like the towers, they incorporate European architectural elements \u2014 upper-floor balconies with arched porticos, for example \u2014 but also have distinctively Chinese features, like niches for family altars.\nFor much of the 20th century, this poor area of China was also, paradoxically, one of the most cosmopolitan regions of the country. It was the point of origin for many Chinese who emigrated overseas and settled in Chinatowns around the world, working in restaurants and on railroad projects. Huang Tang, the head of the Wong\u2019s Association in Taishan, which tracks the genealogy of Wong families from the area (including this reporter\u2019s), estimates that there are 1.3 million Taishanese and their descendants around the world. Perhaps the most prominent Taishanese descendant in the United States is Gary Locke, the current commerce secretary and former governor of the state of Washington.\n\u201cTaishan is a little bit freakish, from the speech of people here to the way they do things to the way they dress,\u201d Mr. Cai said, referring to the inescapable mix of East and West.\nBut Taishan is depopulating, as families continue emigrating overseas to join their relatives or settle in large Chinese cities like Guangzhou. Taishan now has about 900,000 people, a drop of 10 percent since the 1990s.\nSo the towers are neglected or, in some cases, being destroyed. Such was the case in Hehe, a village in Taishan, where a five-story tower at one end was torn down sometime in the last 30 years. In another village, Changgang, a tower still stands, but its metal shutters are rusted and one wall is defaced with graffiti from the Cultural Revolution: \u201cChairman Mao 10,000 years.\u201d\nIn Miaobian, a peasant family has moved into a three-story villa built about 80 years ago by a wealthy relative. Ringed by palm trees, elements of the house could be described as Victorian or Georgian or Edwardian, but not so much Chinese. It has bay windows, cathedral ceilings and a balustrade along the wide staircase leading to the front door.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived here 10 years,\u201d said Wen Weihui, 58, as he stir-fried vegetables in a wok in the villa\u2019s basement. \u201cIt\u2019s my family that built this. The original owner died in America.\u201d\nMr. Wen moved in with his wife and adult son after the previous occupants left for the United States. Mr. Wen\u2019s family once lived in a cramped, single-story house. \u201cOf course this is better,\u201d he said. But they have done little upkeep; some windows remain shattered, and dirt is smeared over the walls.\nThe house is one in a row of five villas built by members of the Wen family. Mr. Cai said they were among the most beautiful yang lou in Taishan. The one next door is grander but empty and derelict, fallen plaster on old tiles in the rooms and rusted bars in the window frames.\n\u201cThere should be maintenance work done here, but we can\u2019t contact the owners,\u201d Mr. Cai said.\nThe owners live in Hong Kong and have not put any money into preserving the home, he said. But neither are they willing to turn it over to the local government.\nHere and there, as in nearby Pingzhou, evidence of restoration efforts can be seen. Bamboo scaffolding covered the two towers, and two large Chen family ancestral halls were covered in fresh coats of paint.\nThere is no real estate market for the towers and villas, so it is hard to estimate their financial worth. But some people are recognizing their aesthetic value. In the farm region of Kaiping, next to Taishan, where about 1,800 towers survive, officials applied to the United Nations in 2001 for listing as a Unesco World Heritage site. The application was approved in 2007, spurring preservation efforts.\nThere, in the village of Zili, management of the towers, called \u201cdiao lou,\u201d or fortresses, by the locals, has been turned over to the government, and families have donated heirlooms \u2014 old steamer trunks, bed frames, wooden chairs \u2014 to transform the buildings into mini-museums. The towers, the Unesco Web site says, \u201cdisplay a complex and flamboyant fusion of Chinese and Western structural and decorative forms\u201d and retain \u201ca harmonious relationship with the surrounding landscape.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/asia/04taishan.html", "title": "Fortresses Inspired by West Crumble in a New China", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, toured a sprawling tent city here of 116,000 people forced to flee the fighting in Swat and surrounding areas. It is the largest of 31 camps Pakistan is operating with the assistance of international aid organizations.\nThis week the Pakistani government began sending families home from the camps and pledged to protect them with army troops, despite criticism from some aid groups that it was not yet safe enough.\nAdmiral Mullen said it was too soon to tell whether the successful operations in Swat would carry over to an expected Pakistani offensive against Taliban militants in South Waziristan, a fight most military analysts say would be far more difficult.\nBut the admiral said he was heartened by the Pakistani military campaign and by the army\u2019s decision to keep troops in the area to hold the gains and protect the residents. \u201cIf what\u2019s happened in Swat over the last six weeks or so is indicative, I\u2019m optimistic,\u201d Admiral Mullen said. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned a good deal.\u201d\nA senior Pakistani officer who is overseeing the relief efforts, Lt. Gen. Nadeem Ahmad, estimated reconstruction costs in the war-ravaged areas at $2.5 billion, and said it would take a major effort by the government, aid groups and private donors to return all the displaced successfully and rebuild their communities.\nThe displaced residents were ordered out of Swat on short notice, often less than 24 hours, by the army in May. More than 30,000 troops, assisted by the Pakistani Air Force, have been combating Taliban fighters.\nMany of the Taliban foot soldiers appear to have slipped away and escaped into the surrounding mountains, and the top 21 Taliban leaders in the Swat area have not been captured.\nGeneral Ahmad said about 50 Taliban fighters had been caught inside the camps, including two suspected suicide bombers, often exposed, he said, by residents who had been terrorized by the militants at home. The fighters had shaved their beards and raised suspicions because of their \u201cpink skin,\u201d the general said.\nOn a hazy, 110-degree day here, Admiral Mullen visited classes in tents for schoolchildren, as well as vocational training including masonry and plumbing clinics for men in the camps.\nThe American military has provided tents, fuel, water trucks, generators, air-conditioners and prepackaged meals, but at the request of the Pakistani government has not advertised that fact because the United States is deeply unpopular here.\n\u201cThey appreciate our support, but don\u2019t want the fanfare,\u201d one senior American official said.\nBefore and after his visit to the camp, Admiral Mullen met in Islamabad with Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani Army chief of staff, to discuss continuing military operations. It was the 13th time that Admiral Mullen had met with the general since he took command of the army in November 2007.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/world/asia/17mullen.html", "title": "Head of U.S. Joint Chiefs Praises Pakistani Operation", "author": "ERIC SCHMITT"}

In response, some senators shouted, \u201cAssassins!\u201d\nMs. Englaro was moved last week to a private clinic in Udine, in northeast Italy, that agreed to remove the feeding tube after other public clinics refused. On Friday, doctors began reducing her nutrition intake as protesters gathered outside to pray for her.\nDr. Carlo Alberto Defanti, a neurologist who followed her case for years, said she had died suddenly of \u201cunexpected\u201d causes, according to the Corriere della Sera, the Italian newspaper. As recently as Monday morning, doctors said Ms. Englaro was in stable condition. A court is expected to decide Tuesday whether an autopsy will be conducted, Italian news media said.\nMs. Englaro had been in a persistent vegetative state since a car accident in 1992. Her father fought repeatedly in court for the right to remove the tube, saying it was his daughter\u2019s wish not to be kept alive artificially. The Catholic Church was vehemently opposed to removing Ms. Englaro\u2019s feeding tube, saying it was tantamount to euthanasia, which is illegal in Italy.\nThe intense polemics and deep divisions over the case drew comparisons to the case of Terri Schiavo in the United States. Ms. Schiavo was allowed to die in 2005 after a long legal battle by her husband to remove her feeding tube.\nOn Friday, when Ms. Englaro\u2019s feeding tube was to be withdrawn, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s cabinet introduced an emergency measure forbidding the removal.

{"date": "Sat, 03 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The country\u2019s leading opposition political figure strongly criticized the United Nations on Saturday, accusing its top official here of refusing to properly investigate reports of widespread voting fraud that seriously tainted the presidential election in August.\nAbdullah Abdullah, who came in second in the election, asserted that the reputation of the United Nations had been harmed by what he said was a flawed investigation of the voting fraud during the Aug. 20 election.\n\u201cI have no doubt in my mind that it has seriously damaged the U.N.\u2019s credibility in Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Abdullah, a former foreign minister, told reporters.\nIn the preliminary tally, President Hamid Karzai won 54.6 percent of the vote, but a partial recount and fraud review under way could reduce that to less than 50 percent, forcing a runoff against Mr. Abdullah.\nMr. Abdullah\u2019s comments come as President Obama is deciding whether to send more troops to Afghanistan \u2014 a decision that has been complicated by the accounts of vote tampering. The widespread reports have led some to question whether Mr. Karzai will be seen as a legitimate leader, if he prevails, and whether he can be an effective partner in American attempts to beat back the Taliban insurgency and win over Afghans angered by years of war.\nOn Saturday, Afghan officials said that an Afghan man wearing a police uniform had shot and killed two American soldiers while they were on a joint patrol.\nMr. Abdullah\u2019s statements followed a report in The New York Times about a letter the United Nations\u2019 No. 2 official in Afghanistan, Peter W. Galbraith, sent to Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general, days before Mr. Galbraith was fired last week. In the letter, Mr. Galbraith accused the head of the mission here, Kai Eide, of concealing reports of electoral fraud that benefited Mr. Karzai and of blocking efforts by United Nations officials to limit the fraud.\nMr. Abdullah said \u201cserious questions\u201d had been raised about Mr. Eide\u2019s role that needed to be addressed.\nMr. Eide has denied the allegations and said he never took any actions to benefit Mr. Karzai. On Saturday, a spokesman for the United Nations in Kabul, Dan McNorton, said that the organization \u201chas not and does not and will not turn a blind eye toward fraud.\u201d Mr. McNorton added that the United Nations had insisted on a \u201crigorous adherence to electoral processes.\u201d\nIn an opinion article published on the Web site of The Washington Post on Saturday, Mr. Galbraith reiterated that he had been ordered not to pursue the issue of fraud and wrote that the United Nations misrepresented the reason he was fired. The United Nations press officials, he said, had told reporters that he was fired because of a personality clash with Mr. Eide; he said the dispute was instead over \u201cwhether the U.N. mission would respond to the massive electoral fraud.\u201d\n\u201cThe fraud has handed the Taliban its greatest strategic victory in eight years of fighting the United States and its Afghan partners,\u201d he wrote.\nAmerican officials increasingly accept the idea that Mr. Karzai will be the next president.\nMuch about the killing of the American soldiers in eastern Afghanistan remained unclear on Saturday night.\nAfghan and American officials were investigating whether the attacker, who later escaped, was a police officer or a militant dressed as one, the Interior Ministry said. An American military spokeswoman confirmed the American casualties but declined to give further details. The shooting occurred Friday around midnight in Wardak Province, one of the first areas to receive fresh American troops as part of Mr. Obama\u2019s troop increase this year.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/world/asia/04afghan.html", "title": "Afghan Says U.N.

She has been in prison since her arrest on May 14.\nThe case involves an incident in which an American intruder swam across a lake and spent two nights in her villa on a mission, as he told the court, to save her from assassins.\nAlso on Friday, Burmese exile sources said the authorities had detained as many as 30 pro-democracy advocates and members of the National League for Democracy, the country\u2019s main opposition group. But they said it seemed that an unknown number of them had been held only briefly and then released.\nAnalysts say they believe that the case is aimed at keeping Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi in detention through an election that is planned for early next year. Her latest six-year term of house arrest expired in mid-May.\nThe election is part of a \u201croad map to democracy\u201d under a new Constitution that would legitimize the military control that has isolated and impoverished the country, formerly called Burma, since a coup in 1962.\nIt would be the first nationwide election since 1990; the military annulled that election after the National League for Democracy won in a landslide.\nIn a telephone interview before the court session, U Nyan Win, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyer, said that he told reporters in Yangon that his client was not surprised by the delay, and that she expected to be convicted.\n\u201cShe\u2019s mentally very good,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can command our team. She\u2019s in good spirits.\u201d\nMost foreign reporters are barred from entering Myanmar, but Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi told diplomats who were allowed to attend the final session of the case on Tuesday, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the verdict will be painfully obvious.\u201d\nJared M. Genser, a lawyer who works on Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s case for Freedom Now, an American nonprofit organization that seeks to free political prisoners, said in an e-mail message that the delay was \u201cin some ways a smart move\u201d by the ruling generals.\n\u201cPush off the verdict until the middle of August, when numerous government and United Nations officials around the world will be on vacation,\u201d he said.\nThe intruder, John Yettaw, 53, of Falcon, Mo., also faces at least five years in prison as an accomplice in violating the house arrest, as well as for other charges.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/world/asia/01myanmar.html", "title": "Myanmar Dissident\u2019s Verdict Delayed", "author": "SETH MYDANS"}

The division signaled continuing disarray within the party more than six months after it suffered steep losses in the November elections.\nStill, Republican support in the Senate did not come easy, and party members nearly succeeded in blocking the measure on a procedural motion that left Democrats scrambling for votes.\nSeveral Republicans voiced opposition to the inclusion of $1 billion for a \u201ccash for clunkers\u201d program, which would grant vouchers of up to $4,500 to motorists who trade in their vehicles for more fuel-efficient models, but the provision remained in the bill.\nIn addition to the $80 billion to finance the two wars, the measure includes more than $10 billion in foreign aid, up to $7.65 billion to prepare for handling the swine flu pandemic and billions in loan guarantees for the International Monetary Fund.\nThe bill does not contain the funds the Obama administration asked for to prepare to close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and forbids detainees from being released in the United States. Some members of Congress have expressed concern that if the detention center is closed, detainees could be moved into their districts and states.\nSenators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut independent, had threatened to block the spending measure because it had no longer included a ban on the release of photographs showing abuse of prisoners held by American forces.\nBut the two backed off after separate legislation to ban the photos\u2019 release was introduced and approved by the Senate on Wednesday. Mr. Obama had already said he would work to prevent the release of the photos.\nIn the House, where some Democrats first voted against the bill because of opposition to the wars, party leaders eventually got the votes needed to adopt it, in part by including more money for flu preparation.\nThe House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, told members of her caucus that Mr. Obama had asked her to enlist their support for the bill.\nThe House Republicans, who typically vote for any measure that supports American troops, ultimately rebelled against the provision providing for the I.M.F., arguing that some of the money could end up helping unfriendly foreign governments.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/world/middleeast/19cong.html", "title": "Senate Widely Approves Emergency Funds for Wars", "author": "BERNIE BECKER"}
{"date": "Tue, 03 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 When Gordon Brown talks about the United States, he rarely fails to mention the many summer vacations he has taken on Cape Cod. Perhaps more than any British prime minister since Winston Churchill, he exudes a personal fondness and admiration for America, and he says his experiences there have helped make him a committed \u201cAtlanticist.\u201d\nBut no trip to the United States has been weightier for Mr. Brown than the two-day visit to Washington which he began on Tuesday and which will include a meeting with President Obama. He will be the first European government leader to visit the White House since Mr. Obama took office, and he said in a weekend newspaper article that he aimed to give new momentum to the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Britain and the United States.\n\u201cThere is no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between Britain and the United States,\u201d Mr. Brown wrote in The Sunday Times of London. \u201cI believe there is no challenge so great or so difficult that it cannot be overcome by America, Britain and the world working together,\u201d he added.\nHe said he planned to discuss with Mr. Obama his ideas for \u201ca global New Deal, whose impact can stretch from the villages of Africa to reforming the financial institutions of London and New York.\u201d\nThe British leader seemed undaunted by the comments of Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, who said last week that the visit would be an occasion to renew the \u201cspecial partnership\u201d between the two countries, a slight shift in language that had some Britons saying that Mr. Obama might be pulling back from the closeness that had developed between President George W. Bush and Tony Blair, Mr. Brown\u2019s predecessor.\nBritish newspapers have noted that Mr. Obama\u2019s formative experiences abroad were as a child in Indonesia, and that his administration intended to give new priority to American ties in the Pacific. The Sunday Telegraph reported that Mr. Obama had ordered the removal of a bust of Churchill displayed in the Oval Office under Mr. Bush, and it noted that Mr. Obama devoted 35 pages of his memoir, \u201cDreams From My Father,\u201d to his grandfather\u2019s claims of torture under British colonial rule in Kenya.\nEven reaching the Oval Office before President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany may mean less than meets the eye. Mr. Obama\u2019s first presidential visit to Europe will be for an economic summit meeting in London in April. White House officials have pointed to Mr. Brown\u2019s chairmanship of the meeting and the need to set common goals for resolving the global financial crisis as central reasons for inviting Mr. Brown first.\nStill, British pundits have cast the visit as an opportunity for Mr. Brown, 58, to begin a revival of his sinking political fortunes at home, and to help his chances of leading the Labor Party to re-election sometime before June next year.\nPart of the bounce Mr. Brown is seeking, the pundits say, could come simply from the fact of meeting with Mr. Obama. The American president continues to receive approval ratings in European polls that are as high or higher than those he has received in the United States, and European leaders hope some of that popularity will rub off on them.\nMr. Brown has said that he sees himself as a natural partner for Mr. Obama, as a left-of-center leader battling political opponents \u2014 Republicans in the United States, Conservatives in Britain \u2014 who have resisted huge economic stimulus programs and bank bailouts. In his newspaper article, Mr. Brown said he would also seek common ground with Mr. Obama on action to slow climate change and on development aid to the world\u2019s poorest countries.\nOne point on which Mr. Brown seems likely to resist his American host is Afghanistan. Britain has deployed more than 8,300 troops there, second only to the United States. However, Britain has said it is reluctant to respond to Mr. Obama\u2019s call for more NATO troops to match the increase of 17,000 American troops he announced last month, at least as long as other nations refuse to increase their combat forces. France and Germany\u2019s troop commitments are currently a fraction of Britain\u2019s.\nMr. Brown also hopes to benefit in Washington from the plaudits he won last fall for his program to recapitalize Britain\u2019s failing banks before the Bush administration adopted that approach. That early surefootedness, from a man who served 10 years as Britain\u2019s finance minister, helped Mr. Brown in the polls at home.\nBut with unemployment soaring, home prices plunging and the failure of billions injected into the banks to revive credit flows, Labor\u2019s recovery has faltered. Recent polls have shown the Conservatives with a lead of 10 percentage points and more.\nMr. Brown\u2019s personal popularity has plunged, too, partly because of what many see as his refusal to acknowledge his failure, as finance minister, to tighten the lax regulation of investment banking and hedge-fund management that financial experts said was a primary contributor to the financial crisis.\nThat criticism seems unlikely to relent, especially when comparisons are drawn with Mr. Obama. \u201cWhen Obama bungled a key appointment recently, he simply said, \u2018I screwed up,\u2019 \u201d Martin Ivens, a columnist in The Sunday Times, wrote this weekend. By contrast, Mr. Brown\u2019s strictures for one of the British bankers whose missteps forced a multibillion-dollar government bailout, and who then quit with a pension of close to $1 million a year, seemed \u201ca bit rich,\u201d Mr. Ivens said, \u201cwhen Brown can\u2019t bring himself to say \u2018sorry\u2019 for anything.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/europe/04brown.html", "title": "Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Hopes to Bolster U.S. Ties", "author": "JOHN F.

{"date": "Thu, 19 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SHANGHAI \u2014 One of China\u2019s most prominent and provocative artists is challenging the government to end what he calls its cover-up of incompetence in managing the response to an earthquake last May in Sichuan Province that killed more than 80,000 people.\nThe artist, Ai Weiwei, 51, who helped design the Olympic National Stadium known as the Bird\u2019s Nest, is creating a sensation in China by posting angry commentaries about the quake rescue efforts on his popular blog.\nIn the online postings, Mr. Ai criticizes the government\u2019s management of the disaster response and chides officials for still not having provided a full accounting of schoolchildren\u2019s deaths, which he and many others attribute to poorly constructed schools.\n\u201cI\u2019m really tired of this bull,\u201d Mr. Ai said Thursday in a telephone interview from Beijing, where he has a large studio. \u201cI went there, and I saw the school building collapsed, and next to it is a building that is fine.\u201d\nOn his blog, the artist has published his own list of children killed in the 7.9-magnitude earthquake, gathering more than 1,500 names. He has also posted transcripts of conversations he and others have had with government officials who have refused to cooperate with them. \u201cYou have to provide letters and stamps and tell the civil affairs office what you want and what you need it for,\u201d is a typical official response he has received to his inquiries, he said.\nThe postings are unusual in that they have not yet been censored or removed from the Internet. Mr. Ai is being allowed to criticize the government sharply about a very delicate topic in Beijing.\nHarsh critics of the government are often censored, muffled or arrested, and crackdowns on dissent are common. Last June a human rights activist named Huang Qi was arrested and charged with illegally possessing state secrets after he aided parents who demanded that those responsible for poor school construction be held accountable. Mr. Qi had posted information about their demands on his Web site.\nBut Mr. Ai, the son of one of the greatest Chinese modern poets, Ai Qing, is being allowed to speak out so candidly on a government-controlled Web site.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very much an agent provocateur,\u201d said Meg Maggio, director of the Pekin Fine Arts Gallery and a longtime friend of Mr. Ai. \u201cHe\u2019s a public figure and he\u2019s from a very important intellectual family, so maybe he\u2019s reached a status and can say a lot of things.\u201d\nAfter the earthquake last May, the government essentially barred Chinese journalists from reporting on the subject of shoddy school construction and the deaths of children, according to several Chinese journalists.\nAngry parents in Sichuan have demonstrated and pressed the government to explain why so many schools collapsed while other buildings nearby remained intact. Many blamed government corruption in the construction process for the differences in the stability of the buildings. Public security agents have broken up many of the demonstrations and have even harassed parents for pressing the case.\nNearly 10 months after the earthquake, the Chinese government still says it is unclear how many children died in the rubble.\nThis month, Wei Hong, executive vice governor of Sichuan, told the news media that there was still no final number for children\u2019s deaths and that experts had concluded that the intensity of the quake, and not poor construction, was the main reason for the high death toll.\nMr. Ai rejects that explanation and says he is determined to get the names of the victims himself.\n\u201cI want to do it before the one-year anniversary,\u201d he said.\nHe added Thursday, \u201cIf you see the photos, it\u2019s so unbelievable, so sad to see what happened to those children.\u201d\nA man who answered the telephone in the general office of the Sichuan provincial government in Chengdu declined to give his name but confirmed that Mr. Ai or one of his researchers had called the office.\n\u201cHe\u2019s totally crazy, he kept asking questions again and again,\u201d the man said. \u201cMy colleague was quite cooperative and patient. You know, some data and reports on the student death toll, it\u2019s not our duty to give him.\u201d\nMr. Ai is not new to controversy. He is known for his avant-garde photographs and sculptures and for his blend of traditional Chinese elements and modern style \u2014 but also for his sharp tongue.\nAlthough he helped design the National Stadium, he vowed to stay away from the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, saying he believed in freedom, not autocracy.\nNow, he says he is determined to produce a documentary on the earthquake. He said a team of more than 100 people had already conducted dozens of interviews with grieving parents for the film.\nAsked why his blog had not been shut down, he admitted to being perplexed.\n\u201cEvery day I\u2019m waiting for that, but it hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/world/asia/20quake.html", "title": "Artist Defies Web Censors in a Rebuke of China", "author": "DAVID BARBOZA"}
{"date": "Sat, 05 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SIBIU, Romania \u2014 Klaus Johannis, the successful mayor of this Transylvanian city, finds himself at the center of the bitterly fought presidential election here, even though he is not running for office and is not even ethnically Romanian.\nThe fact that Mr. Johannis comes from the country\u2019s tiny German minority, which would be a major liability in other countries in Eastern Europe, puts him at a distinct advantage here in Romania. So much so, in fact, that should the Social Democratic challenger, Mircea Geoana, succeed in his bid to unseat the incumbent center-right president, Traian Basescu, in Sunday\u2019s vote \u2014 he is leading in the polls \u2014 he has promised to appoint Mr. Johannis as prime minister.\nMr. Geoana\u2019s decision to back Mr. Johannis for prime minister as one of his campaign promises hinges on the mayor\u2019s success in rebuilding this old town into a small gem that was named a European Capital of Culture in 2007 while attracting foreign investments and thousands of jobs to this unlikely corner of the Continent. But Mr. Johannis also benefits from the positive stereotypes Romanians associate with the German population, known as Transylvanian Saxons, who have called the region home since the 12th century.\nThe Saxons, known in German as Siebenb\u00fcrger Sachsen, are considered hard-working, precise and uncompromising, an attractive mixture in a country tired of mismanagement and corruption, and one of the hardest hit in Europe by the economic crisis. It also does not hurt that the country experienced some of its best moments under German kings more than a century ago, even though the monarchs were unrelated to the local German population.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a real advantage that he\u2019s German,\u201d said Bianca Florea, 18, a student, as she passed through the main town square in Sibiu on Friday. \u201cWell, not exactly German, but Saxon.\u201d Asked why, Ms. Florea responded, \u201cWe Romanians are a bit lazy, that\u2019s my opinion.\u201d\nBut like most of the dozen residents interviewed here, she was skeptical about Mr. Johannis\u2019s prospective move to Bucharest, despite praising his work as mayor.\n\u201cHe could go there and do a good job for a while or he could be a puppet for others,\u201d Ms. Florea said. Mr. Johannis belongs to none of the major parties, but instead to the small German Democratic Forum, which represents the 60,000 ethnic Germans remaining in the country. Hundreds of thousands of others left during the oppressive regime of Nicolae Ceausescu and in the years immediately after the fall of Communism 20 years ago.\nPolitical analysts in Bucharest say that for all Mr. Johannis\u2019s successes managing Sibiu, working as a figurehead leader in the capital at the whim of hard-nosed political operators would be another story.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk business because I would be an independent prime minister running a political government,\u201d Mr. Johannis said in an interview in his office overlooking the town square on Friday. \u201cNobody\u2019s tried this before. But I\u2019m pretty optimistic it would be a success.\u201d\nFew question his success in Sibiu, or Hermannstadt in German. Local residents like to joke that his vote tallies for his re-election bids in 2004 (87 percent) and 2008 (83 percent), look like rigged elections under Communism. And that comes despite the fact that ethnic Germans represent just 2,000 of the city\u2019s 155,000 people.\nMr. Johannis, who is fluent in English as well as German and Romanian, traveled the Continent drumming up interest in the city, helping to attract major companies like Renault and Siemens.\nBut he built his reputation among voters by building roads and bringing heating to once-unheated schools in town, and for showing up personally for spot-checks at municipal offices and building sites, a form of hands-on management that he conceded in the interview would be impossible on a national scale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to change a city and run it,\u201d Mr. Johannis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different business to change a country and run it. But I think in the end, the abilities that a public manager needs are the same in a mayor as in a prime minister.\u201d\nRomanians appear ready to take a gamble, in part because they find themselves in such a difficult spot. The International Monetary Fund forecast an 8.5 percent contraction in the country\u2019s economy for 2009, and along with the European Union and other institutions, it put together a $30 billion bailout for the country earlier this year.\nBut that sorely needed money is at risk unless the government can make difficult changes.\nInstead, this past autumn saw turmoil, infighting and the collapse of the government in a no-confidence vote in October. A poisonous presidential campaign fought more over personal issues than substantive policy has only increased the public\u2019s desire for a new face, preferably a German one.\n\u201cWe used to have a German dynasty, which created the modern Romanian state,\u201d said Sorin Ionita, research director of the Romanian Academic Society in Bucharest. King Carol I, who was born in what is now southern Germany, ruled for nearly 50 years, through the turn of the last century, a golden age for Romania. \u201cThe Germans today, they benefit from this image in Romania,\u201d Mr. Ionita said.\nBut the Germans suffered under the Ceausescu dictatorship, a period that received renewed attention this year when Herta M\u00fcller, an ethnic German born and raised in Romania, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for her novels about that time. Mr. Ceausescu literally sold ethnic Germans to the West German government for hard currency, several thousand dollars worth for each of them, in return allowing roughly 10,000 to 15,000 of them to emigrate each year from 1978 to 1989.\nIt was no wonder that many of the Transylvanian Saxons chose to leave after the Iron Curtain fell, including Mr. Johannis\u2019s parents, even though local Romanians demonstrated in the streets for them to stay, recalled Paul Philippi, 86, the honorary chairman of the German Democratic Forum. The exodus reduced a population that once numbered some 800,000 to the small group of mostly elderly people who remain today.\nRomanian children now make up 90 percent of the classes at German-language schools, according to the German Democratic Forum, seeing better economic prospects if they can learn the language of the dwindling group that built the city.\nBut right now, it is the departure of just one German that is on the minds of local citizens, their beloved mayor, who few say they want to lose to national politics. \u201cI would like him to stay for us,\u201d said Aurelia Badila, 58, an accountant, \u201cbut for him it is a promotion, and it could be good for Romania.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/europe/06romania.html", "title": "Grim Romanians Brighten Over a German Connection", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH"}

But it was not immediately clear how soon the trucks carrying crucial supplies for NATO forces would be able to travel through the Khyber Pass to Afghanistan.\nMore than 80 percent of the supplies for American and coalition forces in Afghanistan flow through Pakistan. Attacks aimed at choking the supply lines have become increasingly frequent and brazen, despite the presence of Pakistani security forces in the area.\nA spokesman for NATO forces in Afghanistan, Lt. Cmdr. Chris Hall, said the bridge attack was not expected to hurt NATO supplies. \u201cOur current logistical arrangements are sufficient to meet our needs,\u201d he said.\nPreviously, the militants attacked convoys of cargo trucks with rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles. Consequently, most truck drivers refused to make the trips as they became more dangerous.\nIn December, attacks by Taliban militants on NATO supply depots in Peshawar destroyed 300 cargo trucks and Humvee military vehicles.\nThe increasing vulnerability of the supply line passing through the border areas of Pakistan has forced the United States and NATO to find new supply routes through Central Asia to deliver fuel, food and other supplies to coalition forces in Afghanistan.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/world/asia/04pstan.html", "title": "Bridge Attack Halts NATO Supplies to Afghanistan", "author": "SALMAN MASOOD"}
{"date": "Mon, 16 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD \u2014 It was a day of rejoicing, of drum playing, and of smiling at strangers. Pakistan\u2019s chief justice had just been reinstated after a two-year struggle, and for those assembled in the country\u2019s capital to celebrate, anything seemed possible.\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching history,\u201d said Javed Ali Khan, a 45-year-old who had traveled for days with his wife and six children to participate in a national march of lawyers and opposition political parties that came to an abrupt end on Monday when the lawyers demands were met.\nSamir Ali, 3, was sitting atop his father\u2019s shoulders, waving a tiny Pakistani flag. \u201cWe are so happy,\u201d said his father, a taxi driver, grinning and gesturing at his son. \u201cSee his face? He\u2019s happy too.\u201d\nIn the crowd, whose members included a radio announcer who was researching homosexuality and an illiterate mechanic who wore a flower pot on his head to stay cool and admitted to stealing monkeys to get by, one word was on everybody\u2019s lips.\n\u201cJustice,\u201d said Mr. Khan\u2019s wife, Rubina Javed, smiling broadly. \u201cWe came for justice.\u201d\nThe word was apt for the victory at hand: the restoration of the chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, to his court. But others in a jubilant crowd celebrating on Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s lawn on Monday were working from a broader interpretation.\n\u201cJustice is the solution to the common man\u2019s problems,\u201d Ms. Javed said, seated on a blue scarf on the grass with two daughters and four sons, ages 6 to 18, around her. \u201cI want justice in schools, on roads, in transportation. Now the common man is speaking.\u201d\nIn the Arab world, the word is a constant companion. Islamic political movements use it in struggles against autocrats, arguing that justice is a central tenet of Islam.\nBut in Pakistan, the political class comes from a powerful feudal elite, which has largely avoided policies that would bring greater social equality, like land reform. With only half of the population literate, so far the strategy has worked.\n\u201cThe ruling elite can get away with anything,\u201d said Muhammad Ali, a software engineer. \u201cThey are like kings here.\u201d\nBut the lawyers\u2019 movement may be starting to change that. Though small in number, it is made up of an educated, diverse cross section of Pakistani society that includes lower middle class professionals, whose reach may extend deeper into Pakistan\u2019s 160 million population than initially expected.\n\u201cThis movement has given an awareness to the common people in Pakistan of their rights,\u201d said Shamoon Azhar, 26, a doctoral student at the International Islamic University in Islamabad, sitting on the lawn with a large group of his friends. \u201cThis is about awareness. It\u2019s given people confidence. It\u2019s shown people it can happen.\u201d\nMs. Javed\u2019s daughters both wore stickers of Mr. Chaudhry stuck to the fronts of their brightly colored dresses, with the words, \u201cMy Hero,\u201d in English, in bold script. The family earns about $250 a month, too little to send the children to private school. Most Pakistanis consider their country\u2019s public school system to be broken.\nMr. Chaudhry\u2019s move to press powerful government elites to account for their actions \u201cwould have been normal in Scandinavian countries,\u201d said Faisal Bashir, another in the group, \u201cbut here just by doing something right, turns you into a hero.\u201d\nThe crowd seemed to have a life of its own. Noisy bands of celebrating lawyers swept through, playing drums and singing. Some brought flowers for Mr. Chaudhry. An old man sold spicy vegetable fritters; A boy passed a platter of fresh coconut.\nThey spoke excitedly about how the success of the march had made a break with Pakistan\u2019s past, and how much had changed in the country in the last decade.\n\u201cThe feudal system, it was in the past,\u201d said Mazhar Iqbal, a private school manager. \u201cThere was no media then. No education. The poor were poor forever. Now is the time to wake up. It\u2019s been 60 years and we\u2019ve been wasting our time.\u201d\nSaif Abbas, a consultant who used to work for the Asian Development Bank in Islamabad, was more clear-eyed about the meaning of the march. Pakistan is still a poor country with a vast illiterate population, and a corrupt, unresponsive ruling class, he said.\n\u201cThis country has to take control of its own future, and that\u2019s education,\u201d he said, holding a flag. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re just not there yet.\u201d\nHis vision for Pakistan is a \u201cthoroughly democratic\u201d country based on an Islamic system of governance, with a strong, powerful middle class, like that in Turkey or Malaysia. The current system will simply perpetuate the power of the mullahs on one hand, he said, and the elite, on the other, \u201cwho are totally disconnected from the people of this country.\u201d\nIn that respect, the march was meaningful.\n\u201cThe next government is going to fear the people who pushed this one against the wall,\u201d he said, as a troupe of lawyers from a city in central Pakistan, stormed past.\nA revolution it is not, he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good beginning.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/world/asia/17voices.html", "title": "Pakistanis Rejoice Over Restoration of Justice", "author": "SABRINA TAVERNISE"}

{"date": "Sun, 10 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "Frozen and lonely, Planet X circled the far reaches of the solar system awaiting discovery and a name. It got one thanks to an 11-year-old British girl named Venetia Burney, an enthusiast of the planets and classical myth.\nOn March 14, 1930, the day newspapers reported that the long-suspected \u201ctrans-Neptunian body\u201d had been photographed for the first time, she proposed to her well-connected grandfather that it be named Pluto, after the Roman god of the underworld.\nAnd so it was.\nVenetia Phair, as she became by marriage, died April 30 in her home in Banstead, in the county of Surrey, England. She was 90. The death was confirmed by her son, Patrick.\nVenetia, on the fateful day that Pluto popped into her head, was having breakfast with her mother and her grandfather, Falconer Madan, retired librarian of the Bodleian Library at Oxford. He had exciting news to tell. Scientists at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., had just photographed a planet lying beyond Neptune. Its existence had been postulated since the late 19th century, and astronomers working under Percival Lowell, the observatory\u2019s founder, had been chasing it photographically since 1906. Now theory had become fact.\n\u201cHe wondered what it should be called,\u201d Mrs. Phair recalled in the documentary film, \u201cNaming Pluto,\u201d released last month. \u201cWe all wondered, and then I said, \u2018Why not call it Pluto?\u2019 And the whole thing stemmed from that.\u201d\nMr. Madan passed the idea along to his friend Herbert Hall Turner, professor of astronomy at Oxford. Pluto, he suggested in a letter, was an excellent name for \u201cthe big obscure new baby.\u201d\nMr. Turner, as it happened, was in London for a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, where word of the new planet had members buzzing, and proposals for a name flew fast and furious. \u201cI think PLUTO excellent!!\u201d he wrote to Mr. Madan on his return. \u201cWe did not manage to think of anything so good at the RAS yesterday. The only at all meritorious suggestion was Kronos, but that won\u2019t do alongside Saturn.\u201d (Kronos is the Greek equivalent of Saturn.)\nMr. Turner immediately sent a telegram to Flagstaff: \u201cNaming new planet, please consider PLUTO, suggested by small girl Venetia Burney for dark and gloomy planet.\u201d\nUnbeknownst to Venetia, a spirited battle ensued, with suggestions flying thick and fast. Minerva looked like the front runner, until it was pointed out that the name already belonged to an asteroid. Other candidates included Zeus, Atlas and Persephone. The Austrian engineer and cosmologist Hans H\u00f6rbiger proposed the inscrutable and unpronounceable Onehtn, meaning \u201cfirst trans-Neptune.\u201d\nCapt. Charles E. Freeman, the superintendent of the Naval Observatory in Washington, regarded Pluto as a long shot. \u201cPluto is the prototype of Satan in many minds, and drops out for that reason, perhaps,\u201d he said.\nIn the end, scientists at the Lowell Observatory voted unanimously for Pluto, partly because its first two letters could be interpreted as an homage to Percival Lowell, and on May 24 the new planet received its official name.\nMr. Madan gave his granddaughter a five-pound note, and the family added yet another feather to its cap: in 1877, Mr. Madan\u2019s brother Henry, a housemaster at Eton, had successfully proposed that the two dwarf moons of Mars be named Phobos and Deimos, two attendants of the Roman war god, whose names mean fear and terror.\n\u201cPluto is an excellent name, for two reasons,\u201d Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden Planetarium and author of \u201cThe Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America\u2019s Favorite Planet,\u201d said in a telephone interview. \u201cFirst, it\u2019s a Roman god, as are the rest of the large objects in the solar system, so it conforms to the rules of the time, and second, Pluto is the god of the underworld, a distant place you don\u2019t want to go to. Who could not love the name?\u201d\nVenetia Katherine Burney was born in Oxford, where her father, the Rev. Charles Fox Burney, was a professor of scriptural interpretation. He died when Venetia was 6, and she and her mother went to live with Mr. Madan.\nVenetia developed an interest in astronomy after playing a game with other children in which lumps of clay, standing for the planets, were placed on a lawn in their positions relative to the sun.\nShe attended Downe House, a boarding school in Berkshire, and, after studying mathematics at Newnham College, Cambridge, became a chartered accountant. She later taught economics and math at two girls\u2019 schools in southwest London. In 1947 she married Maxwell Phair, a classicist, who became housemaster and head of English at Epsom College. She is survived by her son, of Cheltenham.\nMrs. Phair tended to play down her stroke of genius. She came up with Pluto, she said, simply because it was one of the few important Roman gods still available for planetary duty. \u201cWhether I thought about a dark, gloomy Hades, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d she told the BBC in 2006.\nRegardless, Pluto was an instant success. Walt Disney used it for Mickey Mouse\u2019s dog, and it provided the name for Element 94 in the Periodic Table, plutonium, which was first identified in 1941. In 1987 the asteroid 6235 Burney was named in Mrs. Phair\u2019s honor, as was a dust-measuring instrument on board New Horizons, the NASA spacecraft that took off for Pluto in 2006.\nMrs. Phair took it in stride when the International Astronomical Union decreed that Pluto was not a planet at all. It was a dwarf planet, and not even the largest one, a lump of rock and ice orbiting in a ring of icy debris known as the Kuiper Belt.\nSome face was saved last year when the union announced the coining of the term \u201cplutoid\u201d to designate a dwarf planet beyond the orbit of Neptune. More vexing to Mrs. Phair was the persistent notion that she had taken the name from the Disney character. \u201cIt has now been satisfactorily proven that the dog was named after the planet, rather than the other way around,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cSo, one is vindicated.\u201d\nAlan M. MacRobert, a senior editor at Sky and Telescope, foresees sweeter vindication ahead. \u201cIn the year 4,000 A.D., when Pluto is hollowed out and millions of people are living inside,\u201d he said, \u201cthe name of Venetia Burney may be the only thing that Great Britain is remembered for.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/11/world/europe/11phair.html", "title": "Venetia Phair Dies at 90; as a Girl, She Named Pluto", "author": "WILLIAM GRIMES"}

The North had said it was putting a satellite aloft, but United States aerospace and military officials said they believed the North was actually testing long-range ballistic missile technology.\nOffice buildings in central Seoul echoed with cheers as the rocket, Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1, or Naro-1, blasted off from South Korea\u2019s space center on the central south coast.\nThe failure to push the satellite into its intended orbit was announced by Ahn Myong-man, the minister of education, science and technology, at a news conference. Mr. Ahn gave no further details. But South Korean news outlets, citing unidentified sources, said the satellite broke away from the rocket about 22 miles farther from the Earth than had been intended.\nNorth Korea has said it will \u201cclosely watch\u201d whether the United States and its allies criticize the South\u2019s rocket launching. There was no immediate reaction from North Korea on Tuesday.\nWith all its neighbors \u2014 China, Japan and North Korea \u2014 pursuing space programs, South Korea has been eager to have its own. But when the United States refused to help, for fear of encouraging a potential arms race in the region, South Korea turned to Russia.\nSouth Korea says that unlike North Korea, it has been pursuing its space program transparently, within the boundaries of its international commitments, not to develop and proliferate long-range missile technology.\nThe Naro-1 was built jointly with Russia\u2019s Khrunichev space production center at a cost of $400 million. After the rocket launching was delayed several times because of technical glitches, a debate flared in the South Korean news media over the wisdom of spending so much to develop a home-grown launching system. Until now, all South Korean satellites have been launched aboard foreign rockets from overseas sites.\n\u201cNorth Korea will surely try to use the South Korean launch to justify its own,\u201d said Jeung Young-tae, an analyst at the government-financed Korea Institute for National Unification. \u201cBut in the end, its attempt will be dismissed as propaganda because there are clear differences between the two.\u201d\nAlthough the rocket technology can be converted into missiles, legal constraints and pressure from the United States will keep South Korea from adapting its space program for military use, he said.\nThe South Korean rocket was carrying a domestically built satellite designed to monitor the atmosphere and the ocean.\nThe launching came on the same day that South Korea and North Korea agreed to hold talks this week about arranging reunions of families separated by the Korean War more than 55 years ago. The discussions between Red Cross officials from both countries would be their first joint meeting in two years.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/26/world/asia/26rocket.html", "title": "South Korea Launches Satellite", "author": "CHOE SANG-HUN"}
{"date": "Wed, 07 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PRAGUE \u2014 The European Union has stepped into a dispute between Russia and Ukraine that has drastically reduced energy supplies to the Continent, saying on Wednesday that it had won agreement from Russia and Ukraine for independent monitoring of natural-gas flows through Ukraine.\nThe pledge, European officials said, should help restore gas supplies to the West, which were entirely halted earlier in the day.\nAfter phone conversations with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his Ukrainian counterpart, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, on Wednesday, the European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, said both leaders had agreed in principle to allow monitors to verify gas movements. But he also warned both countries \u2014 and particularly Ukraine \u2014 that failure to help restore supplies could have consequences for their relationships with the European Union.\n\u201cWe have received assurances both from Prime Minister Putin and Prime Minister Tymoshenko that they both accept international monitors,\u201d Mr. Barroso said.\nThe pipelines crossing Ukraine carry about one-fifth of all the natural gas consumed in Europe. After keeping out of the gas dispute for several days, the Europeans were forced into action on Wednesday when the shutdown left several member nations \u2014 Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary and Romania \u2014 with no Russian gas supplies in the midst of a bitter cold snap.\nBulgaria, almost entirely dependent on Russian gas, was in a particularly dire situation, with several towns going without heat. Romania declared a state of emergency, and a factory in Hungary, a unit of the Japanese automaker Suzuki, said it was halting production because of restrictions on industrial users of gas.\nIn Europe, leaders showed growing alarm and were compelled to mediate, once again, between Russia and a neighboring state, just months after a war between Russia and Georgia.\nRussia said that it would not restore shipments until monitors were in place in Ukraine.\nThe two sides continued to blame each other for the shut-off.\nThe Russian authorities, who had said they would halt a portion of the supply to Europe on Monday, said they were surprised when the reduction was far larger than they had expected, and blamed Ukraine.\nOn Tuesday, Aleksei B. Miller, the chief executive of Russia\u2019s natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, said in comments broadcast on Russian state television that if Ukraine blocked the natural gas shipments, Russia would halt all supplies to the border.\nBy Wednesday morning, Ukrainian gas officials confirmed that all gas shipments from Russia had ceased.\nOleh Dubyna, the chief executive of Naftogaz, the Ukrainian national energy company, said Gazprom halted all supplies at 7:45 a.m. on Wednesday. But Mr. Miller said that by that time Naftogaz had already blocked the last pipeline open to Europe.\nIn two conference calls for journalists, the Russian authorities said Wednesday that they were compelled to better explain their position after the scope of the cutoff began to reverberate through Europe. Ukraine, they said, stopped the compressor stations used to transship gas across its territory, and only in response did Gazprom halt the flow of gas.\n\u201cIn spite of that obvious fact, which is confirmed by Austrian and Slovak operators, that for two nights Ukraine has shut down all pipelines connecting Russia to Europe, we continue at maximum possible technical level to pump gas to the Ukrainian system,\u201d Aleksandr I. Medvedev, deputy chief executive of Gazprom, said Wednesday. \u201cIt is an obvious fact who has shut down the export pipeline system.\u201d\nMr. Dubyna, the Ukrainian energy executive, was scheduled to meet on Thursday in Brussels with Mr. Miller of Gazprom and European Union officials.\nAnd on Wednesday, President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart, Viktor A. Yushchenko. Russian state television news said that Mr. Medvedev, who is not related to the Gazprom executive, had reiterated Russia\u2019s demands for higher payment.\nMr. Barroso said that Mr. Putin had told him that Russia was pumping the gas but that Ukraine was not delivering it. But he added that Ms. Tymoshenko had assured him that Ukraine was not interfering with gas deliveries.\n\u201cIf both Russia and Ukraine behave as they say they are behaving, there should be no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we hope that the Russians put the gas into the Ukrainian network and that the Ukrainians do not interrupt the gas from Russia to the E.U.\u201d\nAlso Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke with Mr. Putin by phone, and in Moscow, Mr. Putin met with a former German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who now serves as chairman of the board of a Gazprom-controlled company planning to build a pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, cutting out Ukraine.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/world/europe/08gazprom.html", "title": "Ukraine Says Russia Cuts Gas Supplies", "author": "STEPHEN CASTLE and ANDREW E.

Some raised the example of Ukraine\u2019s natural gas crisis, saying it was a mistake to grant Russia power over Georgia\u2019s energy supply.\nThe plant straddles the boundary between Georgian-controlled territory and Abkhazia, which was one of two separatist enclaves at the center of the August war between Georgia and Russia. The plant\u2019s dam is on the Georgian side and its controls are on the Abkhaz side. Since the early 1990s, when separatist hostilities broke out in Abkhazia, Georgians have feared losing access to the plant, which now supplies 40 to 50 percent of the country\u2019s electricity.\nThe energy minister, Alexandre Khetaguri, said that the agreement with Inter RAO would secure Georgia\u2019s energy supply and that the Russian partners would pay about $9 million to Georgia every year for use of the plant. Previously, he said, electricity from the plant was consumed in Abkhazia and the Russian North Caucasus but was not paid for.\nHe said the agreement was not yet binding and would most likely be finalized in February.\n\u201cEnergy men cooperate all the time and everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we had the option of not allowing a Russian company to operate at Inguri hydroelectric plant. But why not, if they proposed very advantageous conditions?\u201d\nSalome Zurabishvili, leader of the opposition Georgian Way party, said at a news conference, \u201cThe government is a traitor, which says, on the one hand, that Russia is an occupier, and on the other hand makes deals with the same country.\u201d She said, \u201cThese leaders should go away as soon as possible.\u201d\nLevan Vepkhvadze, an opposition Parliament member, called the $9 million fee \u201ca very low price for losing this vitally important object in Abkhazia.\u201d\nLasha Zhvania, Georgia\u2019s minister of economic development, said there was no risk of Georgia\u2019s losing control of the plant, which will be managed by three Russians and three Georgians and directed by a Georgian appointee. \u201cOne hundred percent of Inguri hydroelectric plant was, is, and will be the property of Georgia forever,\u201d he said.\nThe Abkhaz foreign minister, Sergei Shamba, gave tentative approval of the deal but said any agreement \u201cmust be formalized with us because the hydro plant is located on our side.\u201d\n\u201cThe agreement with Georgia is about the dam, which is located on the Georgian side,\u201d he said, according to Georgian news agencies.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/world/europe/14georgia.html", "title": "Georgia\u2019s Energy Minister Is Assailed for Deal With Russia", "author": "OLESYA VARTANYAN and ELLEN BARRY"}
{"date": "Sat, 27 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SAFA, West Bank \u2014 Ezra Nawi was in his element. Behind the wheel of his well-worn jeep one recent Saturday morning, working two cellphones in Arabic as he bounded through the terraced hills and hardscrabble villages near Hebron, he was greeted warmly by Palestinians near and far.\nWatching him call for an ambulance for a resident and check on the progress of a Palestinian school being built without an Israeli permit, you might have thought him a clan chief. Then noticing the two Israeli Army jeeps trailing him, you might have pegged him as an Israeli occupation official handling Palestinian matters.\nBut Mr. Nawi is neither. It is perhaps best to think of him as the Robin Hood of the South Hebron hills, an Israeli Jew helping poor locals who love him, and thwarting settlers and soldiers who view him with contempt. Those army jeeps were not watching over him. They were stalking him.\nSince the Israeli left lost so much popular appeal after the violent Palestinian uprising of 2000 and the Hamas electoral victory three years ago, its activists tend to be a rarefied bunch \u2014 professors of Latin or Sanskrit, and translators of medieval poetry. Mr. Nawi, however, is a plumber. And unlike the intellectuals of European origin with whom he spends most Saturdays, he is from an Iraqi Jewish family.\n\u201cMy mother gave birth to me in Jerusalem when she was 14,\u201d said Mr. Nawi, who is 57 and one of five siblings. \u201cSo my grandmother raised me. And she spoke to me in Arabic.\u201d\nHis family has trouble understanding his priorities. His mother says she thinks he is wasting his time. And many Israelis, when told of his work, wonder why he is not helping his own. Mr. Nawi has an answer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider my work political,\u201d he said between phone calls as he drove. \u201cI don\u2019t have a solution to this dispute. I just know that what is going on here is wrong. This is not about ideology. It is about decency.\u201d\nFor his activist colleagues, Mr. Nawi\u2019s instinctual connection to the Palestinians is valuable.\n\u201cEzra knows Palestinians better than any of us,\u201d said Amiel Vardi, a professor who works closely with him. \u201cThis is not only because of the language, but because he gains their confidence the minute he starts talking with them. He has all sorts of intuitions as to what should be done, what are the internal relations \u2014 things we hardly ever notice.\u201d\nThe difficulties of Palestinian life in the West Bank have been well documented: Israeli military checkpoints, a rising separation barrier and Israeli settlers. But in this area, the problems are more acute. The Palestinians, many of them Bedouin, are exceptionally poor, and the land they bought decades ago is under threat by a group of unusually aggressive local settlers. The settlers have been filmed beating up Palestinians. Settlers have been killed by Palestinians. But Mr. Nawi said that the law inevitably sided with the Israelis, and that occupation meant there could be no equity.\n\u201cThe settlers keep the Palestinian farmers from their land by harassing them, and then after several years they say the land has not been farmed so by law it is no longer theirs,\u201d Mr. Nawi said. \u201cWe are only here to stop that from happening.\u201d\nThat is not the view of the settlers.\n\u201cHe is a troublemaker,\u201d asserted Yehoshua Mor-Yosef, a spokesman for Israeli settler communities in the area. \u201cIt\u2019s true that from time to time there is a problem of some settlers coming out of their settlements to cause problems. But people like Nawi don\u2019t want a solution. Their whole aim is to cause trouble.\u201d\nTrue or not, Mr. Nawi is now in trouble. Having spent several short stints in jail for his activism over the years, he now faces the prospect of a long one. He is due to be sentenced Wednesday for assaulting an Israeli policeman two years ago during a confrontation over an attempt to demolish Palestinians\u2019 shacks on disputed land on the West Bank. The policeman said Mr. Nawi struck him during that encounter. Mr. Nawi denied it, but in March a judge convicted him.\nWhat is left of the Israeli left is rallying around him, arguing that Mr. Nawi is a known pacifist who would not have raised his hand against anyone.\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve known the man for decades and seen him in action in many extreme situations, I\u2019m certain that the charge is untrue,\u201d David Shulman, a Hebrew University professor and peace activist, wrote in the newspaper Haaretz. Of Mr. Nawi, he added, \u201cHe is a man committed, in every fiber of his being, to nonviolent protest against the inequities of the occupation.\u201d\nMr. Nawi attributes his activism to two things: as a teenager, his family lived next door to the leader of Israel\u2019s Communist Party, Reuven Kaminer, who influenced him. And he is gay.\n\u201cBeing gay has made me understand what it is like to be a despised minority,\u201d Mr. Nawi said.\nSeveral years ago, he had a relationship with a Palestinian from the West Bank and ended up being convicted on charges of allowing his companion to live illegally in Israel. His companion was jailed for months.\nMr. Nawi said harassment against him had come in many forms. Settlers shout vicious antigay epithets. His plumbing business has been audited, and he was handed a huge tax bill that he said he did not deserve. He is certain that his phone calls are monitored. And those army jeeps are never far behind.\nHe is not optimistic about his coming sentencing, although he is planning an appeal. And he says the Israeli news media have lost interest in the work he and his fellow activists do. But he does not stop.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to change reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only Israelis these people know are settlers and soldiers. Through me they know a different Israeli. And I\u2019ll keep coming until I know that the farmers here can work their fields.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/world/middleeast/28westbank.html", "title": "Unlikely Ally for Residents of West Bank", "author": "ETHAN BRONNER"}
{"date": "Thu, 27 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PARIS \u2014 On the edges of a Salvation Army soup line in Paris, a soft-spoken Afghan boy told the story recently of how he ended up in Europe, alone.\nThe boy, who said he was 15 but looked younger, recounted how his family left Afghanistan after his mother lost her leg in an explosion in 2004. They spent three years in Iran, where he went to school for the first time, learning English and discovering the Internet. After his father suffered a back injury that made working difficult, the boy, who declined to give his name, headed west.\nHe spent two months working 11-hour days in a clothing sweatshop in Istanbul, he said. He was then smuggled into Greece, where he was forced to work on a potato and onion farm near Agros for nine months, finally escaping in the back of a truck. He reached Paris by train after nearly a year on the road.\n\u201cI want to go to school,\u201d he said in English. \u201cI would like it if I could be \u2014 it sounds like a lot to ask \u2014 an engineer of computing.\u201d\nThousands of lone Afghan boys are making their way across Europe, a trend that has accelerated in the past two years as conditions for Afghan refugees become more difficult in countries like Iran and Pakistan. Although some are as young as 12, most are teenagers seeking an education and a future that is not possible in their own country, which is still struggling with poverty and violence eight years after the end of Taliban rule.\nThe boys pose a challenge for European countries, many of which have sent troops to fight in Afghanistan but whose publics question the rationale for the war. Though each country has an obligation under national and international law to provide for them, the cost of doing so is yet another problem for a continent already grappling with tens of thousands of migrants.\nIn Italy, 24 Afghan teenagers were discovered sleeping in a sewer in Rome this spring, and last year two adolescents died in Italian ports \u2014 one under a semitrailer in Venice and another inside a shipping container in Ancona. In Greece, which says it is overwhelmed by asylum seekers from many countries, there is no foster system for foreign minors; only 300 can be accommodated in the whole country, officials say.\nAnd in Paris this year, Afghans for the first time outnumber sub-Saharan Africans as the biggest group of unaccompanied foreign minors to request admission to child protection services, said Charlotte Aveline, a senior adviser on child protection at City Hall.\n\u201cSome arrive very beaten, very tired, but if they stay put for just one week they very quickly become adolescents again,\u201d said Jean-Michel Centres of Exil\u00e9s10, a citizens\u2019 organization that works with the mainly Afghan migrants who gather around Villemin Square, close to the Gare de l\u2019Est.\n\u201cFirst they ask where they can go to have papers, then where they can go to school, and where after that they can get a job,\u201d Mr. Centres said.\nThe European Union does not keep statistics on the number of foreign children who are wandering Europe without their families, and the records of aid groups and government agencies vary greatly. But requests for asylum by unaccompanied Afghan minors suggest that there are thousands across Europe. The requests provide a baseline, experts say, because many more youths do not seek refugee status.\nBlanche Tax, a senior policy officer at the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Brussels, said that last year 3,090 Afghan minors requested asylum in Austria, Britain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Germany \u2014 the European Union countries where their numbers rose the most sharply \u2014 more than double the 1,489 requests in those countries in 2007.\n\u201cAfghanistan is hemorrhaging its youth into Europe,\u201d said Pierre Henry, director of France Terre d\u2019Asile, an organization that works with the European Union, the United Nations refugee agency and the French government on asylum affairs.\nThe five Afghan boys interviewed for this article told of being exploited as under-age labor in Greece and Turkey and dodging beatings by the police. None would give his name in order to speak more freely.\nA 17-year-old from the Afghan city of Ghazni said the police repeatedly tried to remove him and another boy from trucks in the port of Patras, Greece, where the authorities destroyed an Afghan squatter camp on July 12.\nOnce in France, the boys face more hardship. The Paris police have started conducting nightly searches to prevent Afghan migrants from sleeping in Villemin Square. The 15-year-old was placed in a cheap hotel, while others were put in temporary shelter in an unused subway station. Others find their own shelter under bridges and beside a canal.\nThe housing, financed by the state, is administered by France Terre d\u2019Asile. The group helps guide the boys through the process of requesting assistance from the French child protection agency, registers their names and gives them French lessons.\n\u201cWe have had some very good success stories,\u201d said Ms. Aveline, the adviser at City Hall.\nThe boys interviewed for this article said they were in limbo, dreaming of going to school and having a normal life.\nOne teenager who has been in Paris for two months was deeply worried about what lies ahead. \u201cHow should I make a future?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m 15 already. I\u2019m on my own. What can I do?\u201d\nYet a few days later, he was full of excitement because France Terre d\u2019Asile had taken him to a swimming pool, the first time he had ever been to one. He was also taking French classes. From his pocket he produced a pencil and paper with pictures of fruits. \u201cI like bananas,\u201d he said in French. \u201cI like apples.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/world/asia/28afghankids.html", "title": "Afghan Youths Seek a New Life in Europe", "author": "CAROLINE BROTHERS"}
{"date": "Fri, 12 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LAHORE, Pakistan \u2014 Militants bombed mosques in two cities in Pakistan on Friday, killing at least nine people, including a leading Sunni cleric who was an outspoken critic of the Taliban.\nIn Lahore, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside the religious complex run by the cleric, Sarfraz Ahmed Naeemi, who had been vocal in his opposition to suicide attacks and other tactics used by the Taliban. The bomb seemed to be aimed at Mr. Naeemi, destroying his quarters near the entrance of the complex\u2019s mosque.\nHe was killed, along with at least five other people. The whitewashed brick wall of the office where he usually sat after delivering his Friday sermon was spattered with blood.\nAnother mosque was bombed in Nowshera, northwest of the capital, killing at least 3 people and wounded more than 20, according to Pakistani television news reports.\nFriday\u2019s attacks were the latest in a rash of suicide bombings and other militant attacks in Pakistan, where the government has begun a military campaign to curb a spreading insurgency, an effort strongly supported by the United States.\nThe string of attacks, which included a truck bombing at the Pearl Continental Hotel on Tuesday, have deepened anger among Pakistanis against the Taliban. Shortly after Friday\u2019s explosion in Lahore, hundreds of mourners gathered in the mosque\u2019s pink and red hall. Enraged crowds chanted \u201cDeath to the Taliban.\u201d\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari, in a televised address broadcast after 1 a.m. on Saturday, condemned the attacks and vowed to continue the fight against the militants.\n\u201cWe will continue this war to the end,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. \u201cThis war has the support of Parliament, the support of the political parties as well as the people of Pakistan.\u201d\nThe Lahore attacker was clean-shaven, not bearded like many religious Pakistanis, according to the police and mosque officials who saw the attacker\u2019s head after the blast. He appeared to be about 18 to 20 years old, the police said. They said the bomber was a resident of southern Punjab, the populous province whose capital is Lahore.\nMr. Naeemi followed a school of thought within Sunni Islam in Pakistan, the Barelvi, which is at odds with the more fundamentalist Deobandi school observed by the Taliban. In 2007, he and other clerics issued an edict against suicide bombing, saying that only the state can wage jihad, not individuals or groups such as the Taliban.\nHe had supported the military offensive in Swat and had termed Taliban a \u201cstigma on Islam.\u201d This month, he and other leading clerics led a rally in Lahore condemning the Taliban as \u201cenemies of Islam and traitors.\u201d\nIn his speech on Saturday, Mr. Zardari said Mr. Naeemi and the other people killed in the bombings were martyrs.\nThe attacker entered from a small door near the cleric\u2019s office, police officials said, which opens to the street. Mr. Naeemi finished his Friday sermon around 2 p.m. The bomb went off an hour later.\nA student at the religious school run by Mr. Naeemi, Sajid Mahmood, said he was having lunch in his room on the second floor when the bomb went off.\n\u201cI thought the whole building had collapsed,\u201d he said. \u201cI rushed down the stairs, and when I reached the bottom I saw Naeemi Sahib and three other people injured,\u201d he said, using the term of respect for Mr. Naeemi.\nThe religious complex run by Mr. Naeemi is located in Garhi Shahu, a congested working-class neighborhood of Lahore. It is considered to be one of the most prominent Islamic schools in the country and was founded in the 1960s. The building has an open courtyard surrounded by dormitories and classrooms.\nThe school has 10 branches in and around Lahore.\nSahibzada Fazal Kareem, a member of the National Assembly and chairman of Sunni Ittihad Council, an alliance of religious parties opposed to the Taliban, called Mr. Naeemi\u2019s killing a \u201cnational tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cThe government should have provided security to Sunni clerics,\u201d Mr. Kareem said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe killing of Mr. Naeemi is an extreme act of terrorism.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/world/asia/13pstan.html", "title": "Moderate Cleric Among 9 Killed in Pakistan Blasts", "author": "WAQAR GILLANI and SABRINA TAVERNISE"}
{"date": "Wed, 18 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Dov Hikind, a member of the New York State Assembly, was in this disputed city on Wednesday looking for property to buy. He said he was most excited about a new apartment complex overlooking the Old City called Nof Zion.\nAt noon, Mr. Hikind led a group of about 50 American Jews in laying a cornerstone for the next phase of Nof Zion, with construction scheduled to start next spring. \u201cI want to buy here,\u201d Mr. Hikind said. \u201cI might make a deal while I am here this time.\u201d\nMore than a real estate deal, though, it would be a statement: Nof Zion, a private Jewish project, is in Jebel Mukaber, a Palestinian Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem, in territory Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war. Israel claims sovereignty over all Jerusalem; the Palestinians demand the eastern part as the capital of a future state.\nEven within Israel, the idea of Jews moving into predominantly Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem stirs heated debate. Two well-known Israeli families refused City Hall\u2019s offer to name the street leading to Nof Zion for their deceased relatives, according to the local Jerusalem press.\nBut illustrating the complexity of the Jerusalem conundrum, others argue that Jews, Christians and Muslims should be able to live wherever they like. Not allowing Jews to live in certain neighborhoods of the city \u201cis segregation,\u201d said Mr. Hikind, a Democrat who represents several heavily Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn.\nWith new tensions surfacing between the Obama administration and Israel over building in contested parts of Jerusalem, the city\u2019s character and future remain central motifs in the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.\nThe cornerstone-laying ceremony at Nof Zion took place a day after the Israeli authorities moved ahead with plans for the expansion of Gilo, a Jewish residential district in south Jerusalem also on land captured in the 1967 war. The plans for 900 more housing units drew a sharp rebuke from the White House.\nPresident Obama, speaking to Fox News from Beijing, said \u201cadditional settlement-building does not contribute to Israel\u2019s security\u201d and would make peace efforts harder.\n\u201cI think it embitters the Palestinians in a way that could end up being very dangerous,\u201d he said.\nFrom 1948 to 1967 Jerusalem was divided between Jordanian and Israeli control. It has been united, at least nominally, under Israeli control for the past 42 years. In that time, the parts of Jerusalem claimed by the Palestinians have turned into a patchwork of Arab and new Jewish neighborhoods, home to as many as 250,000 Palestinians and roughly 190,000 Jews.\nAs long as the populations live in separate quarters, advocates of two states, Israel and Palestine co-existing side by side, say a formula for an agreement on Jerusalem can still be found, with the Jewish areas administered by Israel and Arab areas placed under the control of the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank.\nBut critics charge that mingling the two populations will destroy the prospects for a two-state solution. As a first step toward resuming the peace process, the Obama administration and the Palestinian leadership had been trying to get Israel to halt all settlement activity to create a more conducive environment for talks. The Israeli government has offered to slow down construction, but not to halt it completely, and it refuses to include Jerusalem in any settlement freeze.\nMr. Hikind vociferously opposes the Obama stance, which means, he says, that Jewish residents \u201ccannot build a toilet\u201d in the West Bank. He said he was also for peace, only \u201cunfortunately, it is not happening\u201d right now.\nEarlier this week his party toured the Jewish settlements of Samaria in the northern West Bank with a view toward buying houses or trailers to rent to settler families. On Wednesday morning, before the cornerstone ceremony, the group, which visited the settlements in a show of solidarity, toured Silwan and other Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem where Jewish religious nationalists have moved in.\nNof Zion is built on privately owned land that an Israeli developer bought over the years. In the first stage of the project, 91 apartments were built, and 70 are already occupied. There are kindergartens, a small park with a jungle gym and plans for a domed synagogue.\nAcross town, in the Arab East Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiya, the Israeli authorities on Wednesday demolished a Palestinian home that had been built without a permit. The security forces accompanying the bulldozers were pelted with stones. Several other unauthorized structures were taken down in other Arab areas, including Silwan.\nWhen it comes to demolitions, Jerusalem\u2019s City Hall says it applies the law equally in all parts of the city, regardless of religion or race.

{"date": "Fri, 01 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 The writer Carol Ann Duffy was appointed Britain\u2019s poet laureate on Friday, becoming the first woman to take a 341-year-old job that has been held by, among others, Dryden, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Cecil Day-Lewis and Ted Hughes.\nMs. Duffy, 53, is known for using a deceptively simple style to produce accessible, often mischievous poems dealing with the darkest turmoil and the lightest minutiae of everyday life. In her most popular collection, \u201cThe World\u2019s Wife\u201d (1999), overlooked women in history and mythology get the chance to tell their side of the story, so that one poem imagines, for instance, the relief that Mrs. Rip Van Winkle must have felt when her husband fell asleep, finally giving her some time for herself.\nAnnouncing the decision, the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, called Ms. Duffy \u201ca towering figure in English literature today and a superb poet\u201d who has \u201cachieved something that only the true greats of literature manage \u2014 to be regarded as both popular and profound.\u201d\nMs. Duffy told the BBC radio program \u201cWoman\u2019s Hour\u201d that she had thought hard about accepting the post and that the decision to take it came \u201cpurely because they hadn\u2019t had a woman.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI look on it as recognition of the great women poets we now have writing,\u201d and said that she hoped to use the job \u201cto contribute to people\u2019s understanding of what poetry can do, and where it can be found.\u201d\nMs. Duffy, who has also written plays, and poems and stories for children, has a daughter, Ella. She had a relationship for some time with the Scottish poet Jackie Kay. In an interview with the writer Jeanette Winterson several years ago, she said she had no interest in being known as a \u201clesbian poet, whatever that is.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIf I am a lesbian icon and a role model, that\u2019s great, but if it\u2019s a word that is used to reduce me, then you have to ask why someone would want to reduce me.\u201d She said she preferred to define herself as \u201ca poet and a mother \u2014 that\u2019s all.\u201d\nIt remains to be seen what Ms. Duffy will make of the laureateship, which is something of a work in progress, despite being so ancient.\nBack in the days of Dryden, the first writer to take the job officially, poets laureate were glorified courtiers, writing flattering odes to royal occasions both significant (coronations, deaths) and banal (returns home from journeys abroad). This pressure to commemorate every little thing produced classics like the poem attributed to the Edwardian laureate Alfred Austin, upon the occasion of the Prince of Wales\u2019s getting sick. It included the lines:\nAcross the wires the electric message came\nHe is no better, he is much the same.\nBut Andrew Motion, Ms. Duffy\u2019s predecessor, used the laureateship to bring poetry into schools and elsewhere, and to serve as its most visible national cheerleader \u2014 a \u201ctown crier, can-opener and flag-waver to poetry,\u201d as he put it. He also started the Poetry Archive, a Web site (www.poetryarchive.co.uk) featuring recordings of poets reading their work aloud.\nBut he still felt compelled to write royal poems. In a recent interview Mr. Motion said he found composing the ones about minor events particularly wearisome, especially since the work was often ridiculed by sniping newspapers that seemed eager to find fault.\n\u201cYou could be William Shakespeare and still find these poems difficult to write,\u201d said Mr. Motion, who had held the post since 1999, for the fixed 10-year term.\n\u201cIf the poet laureate is inclined to do it, let him write about events in royal life that are part of the national story,\u201d he said, \u201cbut let\u2019s not expect any poems about Prince William\u2019s birthday.\u201d\nMs. Duffy would seem to agree. When her name was mentioned for the job 10 years ago, she was quoted as saying: \u201cI will not write a poem for Edward and Sophie. No self-respecting poet should have to.\u201d\nThat was a reference to the marriage of Prince Edward, the Queen\u2019s youngest son, and Sophie Rhys-Jones, which Mr. Motion celebrated in a poem entitled \u201cEpithalamium.\u201d (The poem \u201chas two immediate virtues,\u201d the critic Robert Potts said in The Guardian, \u201cit is very short, and it does not mention the couple.\u201d)\nOn Friday Ms. Duffy seemed to soften her position, saying that there are \u201cechoes to be found between poetry and monarchy,\u201d in that both have the ability to transform the ordinary into the magical. But if she weren\u2019t moved by a royal event, she added, \u201cthen I\u2019d ignore it.\u201d\nMs. Duffy, the oldest of five children, grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Glasgow, Scotland. She began writing poetry in school, inspired by several teachers (she mentioned their names on the radio on Friday), and in 1983 won the National Poetry Competition in Britain.\nHer collections, often extended dramatic monologues, have won the Whitbread, Forward and T. S. Eliot poetry prizes, among others. The poet Polly Clark called one collection \u201can encyclopedia of minutely compressed novels,\u201d and said that \u201cthe reader\u2019s head spins with the exuberant voices of psychopaths, lovers, depressed dolphins and mischievous wives, each at a critical point in their life\u2019s journey, each with a compelling back-story revealed in glimpses.\u201d\nJudith Palmer, director of the Poetry Society, said Ms. Duffy had \u201cpaved the way for a whole generation of women poets who came after her,\u201d including Deryn Rees-Jones, Jo Shapcott and Alice Oswald.\n\u201cThe World\u2019s Wife\u201d is full of the rage of women disappointed, discarded or overlooked by men, like the wife of Quasimodo, who falls in love with him despite his deformities, only to have him turn savagely against her for her own physical failings. It has some very funny poems, too, like \u201cMrs Darwin\u201d:\n7 April 1852\nWent to the Zoo\nI said to him \u2014 Something about that chimpanzee over there\nreminds me of you\nSome of Ms. Duffy\u2019s most evocative and moving poems are found in the collection \u201cRapture,\u201d about the many facets of love, from the early \u201cglamorous hell\u201d of falling in love to the agonies of romantic unraveling.\nIn \u201cValentine\u201d she writes of giving a lover not a heart or a rose, but an onion, whose \u201cfierce kiss will stay on your lips,/possessive and faithful.\u201d\nTake it.\nIts platinum loops shrink to a wedding-ring,\nif you like.\nLethal.\nIts scent will cling to your fingers,\ncling to your knife.\nAs poet laureate, Ms. Duffy is to receive \u00a35,750, or $8,500, a year. She said she planned to donate the money to the Poetry Society, to finance an annual poetry prize.\nPoets laureate also traditionally receive \u201ca butt of sack,\u201d which translates into about 600 bottles of sherry. Mr. Motion has for some reason failed to collect his requisite sherry, Ms. Duffy said, \u201cso I\u2019ve asked for mine up front.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/world/europe/02poet.html", "title": "After 341 Years, British Poet Laureate Is a Woman", "author": "SARAH LYALL"}
{"date": "Wed, 03 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 When Liu Suli was released from a Beijing prison in 1991, having served 20 months for his role in the pro-democracy Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he pledged to abide by what he called \u201cthe three noes.\u201d He would grant no interviews about the protests. He would write no articles. He would accept no donations from sympathizers.\nOn that warm June 4 morning, Mr. Liu carried off the corpses of protesters, their blood spattering his shoes. Their sacrifice was too painful to face, much less reconcile.\nBut this week, as the 20th anniversary of the democracy movement\u2019s violent end drew near, Mr. Liu relented. Seated in his Beijing bookstore, interrupted only by countless drags on unfiltered cigarettes and sips of chilled tea, he tried to reconcile Tiananmen then, and China now. He spoke for three hours.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t talk about it any more, I might forget,\u201d he said. \u201cI might not know how to say it.\u201d\nThursday marks 20 years since hundreds of students, workers and average citizens died in an army assault on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in the center of Beijing. Inside China, the day is a nonevent; even oblique references to June 4 are taboo.\nFor the outside world, Chinese officials this year offer a tenable excuse: the protests, they say, threatened China\u2019s stability. With stability restored, China produced an economic miracle that has lifted scores of millions from destitution.\nFor veterans of the June 4 movement, however, reconciliation is seldom so tidy or superficial.\nSome, Mr. Liu says with evident disgust, have put the past aside and embraced the China where Adam Smith, not Marx, is chief ideologist. Others have become permanent dissidents.\nAnd some dwell in an uneasy middle world, part of both Tiananmen and the new China but not wholly in either. They are prosperous lawyers who defend dissidents knowing that it could cost them their jobs, and comfortable academics whose names on a human-rights petition could doom them to demotion or exile.\nAnd they are intellectuals like Liu Suli, who weathered the Tiananmen assault and prison to take a place he never sought in China\u2019s new middle class. Over the 18 years since his release, he has built a popular bookstore and cafe near Beijing\u2019s top academic institution, Peking University, that has become a haven for intellectuals and expatriates. Now 49, he does not seem a man who has suffered these 20 years of stability.\nHe suffers nonetheless. He is appalled by the notion that China\u2019s success was erected on the bodies of Tiananmen demonstrators. He struggles with the inability of Tiananmen\u2019s ideals to gain more than a toehold in his homeland. And he despairs at the oft-expressed thought that his fellow Chinese have made a devil\u2019s bargain, trading the freedom that he and his fellow protesters sought for a chance at a car and a bigger apartment.\n\u201cYou can raise pigs to be very strong and very fat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a pig is still a pig. And a pig has no rights.\u201d\nMr. Liu was 29, with a wife, a 2-year-old son and a lecturer\u2019s job at the Chinese University for Political Science and Law when Hu Yaobang, the Communist leader who was pushed from power for advocating liberal reforms, died in April 1989. Within a week, 100,000 demonstrators filled Tiananmen Square for his funeral. One of Mr. Liu\u2019s students, Zhou Yongjun, became the new democracy movement\u2019s first leader.\nMr. Liu was there too, but as an observer. Camera in hand, he shot dozens of rolls of film documenting the events, and he began to see a timeline of sorts leading to Tiananmen, from protests in 1986 and 1979.\n\u201cThe political demands the students were making were actually an accumulation of 40 years of Communist rule in China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe na\u00efvet\u00e9 and idealism of the students wasn\u2019t just the students; it was the na\u00efvet\u00e9 and idealism of the people.\u201d\nBy the time the students began a hunger strike on May 13, the government had already ruled their protests illegal. China\u2019s rulers, Mr. Liu said, had left themselves no option but violence should the students refuse to back down.\nEventually, he shed his outsider\u2019s position and joined the demonstrators, quickly rising to become the operations director and press spokesman for the Capital Alliance to Protect Law and Patriotism, an ad hoc group that coordinated the protests. He escorted Communist Party officials into the crowd to talk to demonstrators, briefed Western journalists and escorted student leaders to meetings with Chinese Army officers.\nOn June 4 soldiers approached the square\u2019s monument, where Mr. Liu was stationed. One put a gun to his head. An officer approached from behind, warning him in a low voice to flee.\nThey retreated through a chaotic field of overturned buses and burning military vehicles, returning to a university campus where the bodies of seven protesters had been laid on the lawn. He helped move them out of the sun to slow the decomposition process. Mr. Liu and two fellow protesters, wanted men, fled Beijing at the urging of protest leaders.\nBut Mr. Liu soon returned. \u201cIf everybody in the movement escaped,\u201d he said, \u201cthere would be nobody left to continue the movement.\u201d He spent a year and eight months in a Beijing prison with 13 other men, so crowded that not all could lie down at night to sleep. His wife, from whom he has been since divorced, left with his son for the United States.\nMr. Liu\u2019s release in February 1991, even before his case reached trial, was a welcome shock. He was fired from his university position and expelled from the Communist Party, but that suited him. \u201cI told them that anything that has to do with the party has nothing to do with me,\u201d he joked.\nHe says he is still watched constantly by security agents. \u201cThe government really hates us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pains them that we are here. We do a lot of things they don\u2019t like. But the price of destroying us is something they can\u2019t afford.\u201d\nHe says he is now devoting his energies to deeper discussions on how China can rejoin the modern democratic world. For someone who saw his hopes crushed at Tiananmen, it is a tall order, and he knows it.\n\u201cAn idealist in China is a word that stinks up the streets,\u201d Mr. Liu said. \u201c \u2018Idealist\u2019 equals an insane person, or a stupid person, or an idiot. It\u2019s best that you don\u2019t talk about idealists in China.\u201d\nSo is he an idealist?\n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Mr. Liu said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/world/asia/04protester.html", "title": "After Tiananmen and Prison, a Comfortable but Uneasy Life in the New China", "author": "MICHAEL WINES"}

But, in response to questions about Ms. Boyle, a spokeswoman said: \u201cPolice were called to doctors assessing a woman under the Mental Health Act. The woman was taken voluntarily by ambulance to a clinic. At the request of doctors, police accompanied the ambulance.\u201d\nBritish newspapers reported that she had been begun to behave erratically after losing to a dance group called Diversity in the Saturday night finals of the show that had transformed her into a worldwide phenomenon. In public she had seemed gracious in defeat.\nBut one of the show\u2019s judges, Piers Morgan, said Monday that Ms. Boyle, 47, was emotionally drained and exhausted. \u201cNobody has had to put up with the kind of attention Susan has had. Nobody could have predicted it,\u201d he told GMTV.\n\u201cIt has been crazy, she has gone from anonymity to being the most downloaded woman in history,\u201d he said.\n\u201cShe was very tired and hasn\u2019t been sleeping. She has just gone away to have some time to herself and to sleep and eat, doing all the things she hasn\u2019t been able to do in the last week.\u201d\nThe development is certain to renew discussion about the intense pressures that build on contestants in talent shows that form a large part of Britain\u2019s popular television diet.\nFred O\u2019Neil, a former voice coach, told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s such a tragic situation, a woman who really just loves to sing, an innocent woman really, who is just caught up in this fame game.\u201d\n\u201cI just hope that whatever fame that she has got out of this will eventually bring her some happiness.

{"date": "Fri, 06 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 In unusually harsh terms reflecting international frustration with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Friday that the government in Kabul would forfeit its right to international support against the Taliban insurgency if it failed to root out corruption.\n\u201cSadly, the government of Afghanistan had become a byword for corruption,\u201d Mr. Brown said in a speech to defense experts. \u201cAnd I am not prepared to put the lives of British men and women in harm\u2019s way for a government that does not stand up against corruption.\u201d\nHis words were regarded by some analysts as the toughest by a Western leader since Mr. Karzai was declared the winner this week of Afghanistan\u2019s flawed elections.\nThe timing of Mr. Brown\u2019s warning was particularly significant, with the Obama administration under domestic and international pressure to decide whether to commit up to 40,000 more American troops to Afghanistan at a time when international appetite for the conflict seems to be receding.\nMr. Brown was speaking four days after five British soldiers were killed by an Afghan policeman they were supposed to be mentoring in an attack that shook many Britons\u2019 support for the eight-year war. So far, 230 British soldiers have died since the ouster of the Taliban government in 2001. Seven of them died in the past seven days.\nA spokeswoman at the international forces\u2019 joint command in Kabul said Friday that two American soldiers were killed Thursday by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan, but gave no further details.\nThe deaths bring to three the number of United States service members killed in the Afghan war so far this month. October was the deadliest month of the war for American forces, with 59 deaths reported, according to icasualties.org, a Web site that tracks combat deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nMr. Brown reiterated that Britain would not abandon its role in the American-led NATO coalition. \u201cWe cannot, must not and will not walk away.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cIf the Taliban insurgency succeeds in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda will once again cross the border and re-establish themselves in sanctuaries in Afghanistan from where they will plan, train and launch attacks on the rest of the world.\u201d\nMr. Brown said he had spoken several times this week to Mr. Karzai, who had promised that the first action of his new government would be to tackle corruption.\n\u201cInternational support depends on the scale of his ambition and the degree of his achievement in five key areas: security, governance, reconciliation, economic development and engagement with Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors,\u201d Mr. Brown said.\nMr. Brown also echoed calls this week by senior White House officials for Mr. Karzai and the Afghan government to establish an anticorruption commission to establish strict accountability for national and provincial officials.\nIn addition, some American and European officials are pressing for at least a few arrests of what one administration official, speaking to reporters in Washington on Thursday, called \u201cthe more blatantly corrupt\u201d people in the Afghan government. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue.\nAdministration officials declined to provide the names of people they wanted to see arrested and acknowledged that such arrests were a long shot.\nThe international community\u2019s wish list of potential defendants includes Mr. Karzai\u2019s brother Ahmed Wali Karzai, a suspected player in the country\u2019s booming illegal opium trade; Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, who is accused of involvement in the killings of thousands of Taliban prisoners of war early in the Afghan conflict; and one of Mr. Karzai\u2019s running mates, Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, a former defense minister who is suspected of drug trafficking.\nOn Friday, three retired officers who have held the top post in Britain\u2019s armed forces, chief of the defense staff, criticized Mr. Brown in a House of Lords debate on the armed forces, saying, in effect, that he had denied British troops the financing and equipment they needed, exposing them to greater risks.\nOne of the officers, Field Marshal Peter Inge, said of Mr. Brown that the armed forces \u201chave felt that he has never really been on their side.\u201d\nAdm. Michael Boyce said the Brown government \u201cdoes not realize we are at war,\u201d and Gen. Charles Guthrie said \u201cdithering in London\u201d had left \u201cthe people in the front line questioning whether the government is really, really committed to making progress\u201d in Afghanistan.\nBritain is the second largest contributor to the coalition fighting the Taliban, with about 9,000 soldiers, compared with 68,000 Americans. But the steady increase of casualties is eroding public support for the conflict.\nOn Thursday, the body of Sgt. Olaf Schmid, 30, who had died trying to defuse a roadside bomb, was flown back to Britain.\nAs has now become the tradition, the body was driven on Thursday through the Wiltshire village of Wootton Bassett, close to a military airfield used by flights to and from Afghanistan, as a church bell pealed. Mourners stood in silence, laying flowers on a hearse bearing a coffin draped in the red, white and blue union flag.\nSuch poignant moments, broadcast on national television, have raised public doubts about whether the war in Afghanistan could be won.\nMr. Brown\u2019s government insists that British troops will be able to withdraw only when Afghan forces are able to take over the campaign against the Taliban.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/07/world/europe/07britain.html", "title": "Brown Warns Afghan Leader on Corruption", "author": "JOHN F.

{"date": "Tue, 09 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PUERTO CABEZAS, Nicaragua \u2014 After declaring independence from the rest of Nicaragua in April, a group of indigenous activists from the Mosquito Coast readied a grand celebration to commemorate the occasion. Their feast would be ruined, however, when the regional government sent in the police to seize the main course.\nCommercial sales of turtle meat, which has long been a delicacy here, is restricted in Nicaragua because of declining populations of endangered green sea turtles \u2014 one of many cultural clashes that the people in this remote corner of Nicaragua, who have eaten turtle for generations, say have propelled them to create their own country, which they have dubbed the Communitarian Nation of Mosquitia.\nThe Council of Elders of the Miskito people has an extensive list of grievances. For as long local residents can remember, the federal government has allowed outside companies to exploit the raw materials in their jungle territory \u2014 everything from lobster to lumber to gold. Little benefit has come to the people who eke out a living here, they say.\nFed up, the separatists seized the region\u2019s ruling party headquarters on April 19 and appointed H\u00e9ctor Williams as their wihta tara, or great judge. Mr. Williams, a local religious leader whose thin black mustache stretches out toward his deep dimples, said the region suffered from a variety of woes \u2014 devastating hurricanes and rat plagues to a mysterious disease known as grisi siknis, which is marked by collective bouts of hysteria.\n\u201cWe have the right to autonomy and self-government,\u201d declared Wycleff Diego, the breakaway movement\u2019s ambassador abroad, as he held up the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\nOver the weekend, the ruling party, Yatama, literally \u201cSons of Mother Earth,\u201d retook the headquarters in what it said was a peaceful operation. The separatists denied that, saying weapons were used, and vowed to continue to fight for independence.\nDespite the setback, the budding independence movement is giving the Nicaraguan government headaches and rekindling some of the ire from the contra war that tore through this country in the 1980s. Mr. Diego was a soldier in that war, a fighter for the American-backed contras.\nMany Miskito people, who make up one of several ethnic groups on Nicaragua\u2019s diverse Atlantic coast, joined with the contras. They were inspired by their historic animosity toward the rulers in Managua, Nicaragua\u2019s capital, which is 15 hours distant over bumpy dirt roads.\nAs in the rest of Nicaragua, the contra war would leave lasting pain along the coast. The Sandinista government\u2019s armed forces led a fierce campaign to remove Miskitos from their native lands along the Coco River.\nPresident Daniel Ortega, who led the Sandinistas in the 1980s and then returned to power in January 2007, is widely distrusted by local residents, even more so after his government\u2019s lackluster response to Hurricane Felix, which leveled many coastal communities in September 2007.\nThe breakaway movement, some say, has also been fueled by the Ortega government\u2019s failure to support thousands of impoverished contra war veterans, who had been promised land, housing and other assistance during his presidential campaign.\nEven the government\u2019s allies, while condemning the independence movement, concede that Managua could have responded better to the Miskitos\u2019 needs. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been the best administrators of public things, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should spill blood,\u201d said Steadman Fagoth, a former Miskito independence leader and contra commander who has since allied himself with Mr. Ortega.\nA top Sandinista leader, Gustavo Porras, has accused Robert Callahan, the American ambassador to Nicaragua, of conspiring with the separatist movement in cold war-era fashion. Mr. Callahan, who worked in the American Embassy in Honduras when it was the command center for the Reagan administration\u2019s contra campaign, denies involvement.\n\u201cThe question regarding any contentious issues that may exist between parts of the Miskito community and the government of Nicaragua is a matter for the Nicaraguans, and one that they themselves must resolve,\u201d he said in a statement.\nTwo major drilling concessions have been granted off Nicaragua\u2019s Caribbean coast, but officials involved in those efforts said that the separatist movement might scare away future investors. \u201cIt\u2019s going to send the signal that you can\u2019t do business in Nicaragua,\u201d said Stan Ross, chief executive at Infinity Energy, a Denver-based company.\nConcerned about provoking further instability, regional authorities had refrained from forcibly removing the independence leaders from the party offices. Puerto Cabezas has twice been racked by violent protests in recent years: in 2007, when residents complained that the government was not helping them enough to recover from the hurricane, and in 2008, when Mr. Ortega\u2019s government postponed mayoral elections.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to fight between Miskito and Miskito,\u201d Reynaldo Francis, the regional governor, said before this weekend\u2019s action. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re afraid of that movement.\u201d\nMr. Williams, the separatist leader, who has enlisted the support of hundreds of Miskito lobster divers who are protesting a drop in pay as lobster prices plunge, said he had to discourage the divers this weekend from attacking the party offices.\nThe only weapons visible during a recent visit \u2014 before the weekend eviction \u2014 were slingshots, although the separatists said they were seeking financing to train and equip an army of 1,500.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll defend our natural resources,\u201d vowed Guillermo Espinoza, the movement\u2019s defense minister, who was known as Comandante Black Cat during the contra war. If no guns can be found, he said, the separatists will make weapons themselves.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/world/americas/10nicaragua.html", "title": "An Independence Claim in Nicaragua", "author": "BLAKE SCHMIDT and MARC LACEY"}
{"date": "Tue, 08 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s foreign minister said Tuesday that talks over relocating a United States air base on Okinawa had been suspended, in a sign of renewed disagreement over an issue that has come to dominate an increasingly rocky relationship between Tokyo and Washington.\nThe foreign minister, Katsuya Okada, offered no reason for the suspension of a working group to discuss a 2006 deal to move the Marine Corps air station at Futenma to a less populated part of Okinawa. But major Japanese newspapers, citing anonymous sources within the Tokyo government, said that talks had at least temporarily broken down.\nWhile the Obama administration has opposed altering the agreement, the new Japanese government of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has spoken of possibly moving the base, which now sits in the middle of a city, off Okinawa altogether. Mr. Hatoyama has said that he will decide as early as next week whether to ask Washington to renegotiate the deal. Okinawans have held large protests in recent weeks calling for removal of the base from the island.\nOn Monday, Mr. Hatoyama said he might try to decide in time to directly convey his decision to President Obama during the environmental summit meeting taking place in Copenhagen.\nThe government\u2019s top spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi Hirano, suggested that Japan might ask the United States to consider ways to reduce the American military footprint on Okinawa, the southern island where many of the 50,000 United States military service members in Japan are based.\n\u201cThe Okinawa base problem is all about how to relieve the burden of danger and noise for Okinawans,\u201d Mr. Hirano told reporters on Monday.\nThe Obama administration is trying to find common ground with a more assertive Japanese government that has talked of becoming a more equal partner with the United States. Political analysts have also spoken of a lack of communication between Tokyo and Washington after the slightly left-leaning Mr. Hatoyama took power in an election in August that ended a half-century of leadership by Japan\u2019s pro-American Liberal Democrats.\nOfficials in the Obama administration say that while they are frustrated by the breakdown in talks, they are aware of Mr. Hatoyama\u2019s domestic political pressures. On Tuesday, a senior administration official played down the risk to the broader alliance from the current rift.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a sense that Japan is going south,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a new partner, and they\u2019re trying to do things differently.\u201dStill, most political analysts have said that the alliance between the United States and Japan remains solid under Mr. Hatoyama, who has called relations with Washington the bedrock of his foreign policy. But they also say the dispute over the base places Mr. Hatoyama in a tough political spot, forcing him to choose between pleasing the United States and being responsive to his domestic supporters.\nPublic opinion on Okinawa is firmly against the agreement. So is a tiny leftist party, the Social Democrats, whose support Mr. Hatoyama needs in a coming vote on the government\u2019s budget.\nThe working group was set up during Mr. Obama\u2019s visit to Tokyo last month. But from the beginning the two countries seemed to have different views of its purpose, with American officials insisting they would only discuss how to implement the 2006 agreement.\nWashington has resisted changes to the accord, which is part of a larger, more complex deal that also calls for 8,000 Marines to move to Guam. Mr. Hatoyama has also said that he may seek to reduce Japan\u2019s portion of the overall deal\u2019s $26 billion cost, citing a need to reduce his nation\u2019s ballooning public debt.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/world/asia/09japan.html", "title": "Japan Suspends Talks on Where to Move a U.S. Air Base", "author": "MARTIN FACKLER"}

That would give it just enough margin to continue as the only left-of-center government in Scandinavia and one of the few remaining in western Europe.\nThough Mr. Stoltenberg declined to claim victory early Tuesday, he sounded optimistic, saying voters showed a clear desire \u201cto renew, strengthen and improve the Norwegian social welfare.\u201d A short time later, he told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m going home to bed.\u201d\nAll major news media organizations called the election in his favor. \u201cThe prime minister can take this as a personal victory and a victory for the Labor Party,\u201d said Harald Stanghelle, political editor of the newspaper Aftenposten.\nNorway has sailed through the financial crisis without serious disruption thanks to its collective oil wealth. Analysts said voters seemed cautiously determined to expand social benefits that already include broadly available public day care, free college tuition and extensive mass transit.\n\u201cThis election, like the three previous ones, was all about schools, higher education, children, families, health care, the elderly and the environment \u2014 everything that touches on quality of life,\u201d said Tor Bjorklund, a professor of political science at the University of Oslo.\nIf the nearly complete results hold, Labor will have boosted its representation in Parliament by three seats, to 64. Its partners, the Socialist Left and Center parties, collected about 22 seats between them, a slight decline from the election in 2005.\nPractically absent from the campaign were questions of foreign policy, such as the sitting government\u2019s refusal to allow the 500 Norwegian soldiers serving under NATO command in Afghanistan to fight in the south of that country, where the Taliban insurgency is strongest.\nAll four opposition parties favored removing the restriction, which NATO\u2019s leadership has complained about, but none of them made it a campaign issue in deference to popular sentiment. No one on either side of the political divide raised the issue of joining the European Union, which Norwegians rejected by referendum in 1994.\nThe biggest party on the conservative side remained Progress, led by the country\u2019s most strident politician, Siv Jensen. Her outspoken opposition to immigration and foreign development aid \u2014 which she called \u201caid for corrupt dictators in Africa\u201d \u2014 was coupled with a populist call to slash taxes and spend more of Norway\u2019s oil revenue on government operations. That helped her party win about 23 percent of the vote, giving it an estimated 41 seats. But opinion polls as recently as a week ago had suggested an even stronger showing.\n\u201cMany voters want Progress to be there as a protest party, but they don\u2019t want to see them in office,\u201d Mr. Stanghelle of Aftenposten said of the apparent drop in support for the party.\nThe Progress Party\u2019s rise in recent years has come mostly at the expense of the moderate Conservative Party, which traditionally has been the main counterweight to Labor. Monday\u2019s tentative result gave the Conservatives 30 seats, an increase of eight but still well below the party\u2019s heyday in the 1980s.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/world/europe/15norway.html", "title": "Labor Headed for Victory in Norway Vote", "author": "WALTER GIBBS"}

The Taliban have warned people not to vote and have said they will seek to disrupt the election.\nAs fighting took place here in Pul-e-Alam, the capital of Logar Province, President Hamid Karzai was introducing his election manifesto in Kabul, an hour\u2019s drive to the north.\nMr. Karzai said that if he was re-elected, his priority would be bringing peace and security to the country; he promised to double the strength of the Afghan police and army forces by the end of his second elected term.\nA new opinion poll released Monday showed that views of Mr. Karzai were generally positive, but that his support had dropped to 45 percent, opening the possibility of a runoff after the Aug. 20 election, in which more than 50 percent of ballots are needed to win outright.\nThe poll, by Glevum Associates and financed by the United States government, surveyed more than 3,500 Afghans from July 8 to 19, had a margin of error of less than two percentage points and took equal samples from all provinces.\nIt found that security was less of a concern to Afghans than corruption or a lack of jobs, but attacks like the one in Pul-e-Alam were clearly intended by the Taliban to further intimidate the population before the election.\nShopkeepers said seven to eight gunmen drove their Toyota up to a shopping center shortly after noon, shot the civilian watchman and rushed to occupy the second and third floors.\nFrom their high positions, they opened fire on the provincial police headquarters and the provincial governor\u2019s office nearby, said one shopkeeper, Zemaray, 22. \u201cI saw one of them; his face was wrapped with his turban, and he was firing a rocket,\u201d said Zemaray, who like many Afghans uses one name.\nAs the gunmen seized the building, other insurgents fired mortar shells into the town from a hilltop outside of it, officials inside the governor\u2019s office said. But townspeople said the mortar shells might have come from a hilltop police post that was aiming at the insurgents.\nSome of the Taliban gunmen wore suicide vests packed with explosives, and one bomber detonated explosives in a car outside the police headquarters, the officials in the governor\u2019s office said.\nHajji Shaukat, an assistant to the governor, said he was in the governor\u2019s office when it was attacked. \u201cThere have been a number of suicide attackers, armed with guns, that attacked government and police buildings, and we can still hear shooting going on,\u201d he said by telephone.\nSecurity guards repelled the attack, he said, and even the governor, Atiqullah Ludin, a former general, took up arms.\nNaqibullah, 19, a witness on the street, said that after a half-hour firefight, the gunmen\u2019s car exploded in front of the shopping center. Afghan and American forces surrounded the building as Apache helicopters circled and fired rockets into it.\nBy late afternoon, three gunmen appeared to have been killed, but fighting continued as government forces tried to kill or capture the remaining gunmen, according to Din Muhammad Darwish, a spokesman for the governor of Logar. One gunman blew himself up with the car bomb; one was killed by rocket fire from the helicopters; and one died in a firefight with Afghan security forces, he said.\nAmerican forces moved into the shopping center and swept the upper floors. An American soldier said a soldier had been shot in the area, but gave no more details and moved reporters back from the building as sporadic explosions went off.\nOne police officer was killed, and another officer and an Afghan soldier were wounded in the fighting, Mr. Darwish said. A police officer said two officers and a civilian had been killed, and many others wounded.\nThe main road connecting the capital, Kabul, to the southeastern region of the country was cordoned off by dozens of Afghan police officers and American soldiers, snarling traffic.\nA Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahed, claimed responsibility for the attack and said six suicide attackers had struck the police station and governor\u2019s office, as well as an election commission office.\nIn announcing his plans to expand security forces, Mr. Karzai said he would increase the number of police officers to 160,000 from 80,000. He said the Afghan National Army would grow to 260,000 troops over five years, beyond the planned 134,000. The Afghan Air Force would grow to a fleet of 130 helicopters and planes from 45, he said.\n\u201cGradually Afghanistan will defend its sovereignty by itself and will fight the enemy that is threatening this country and create a situation that the international community forces go back to their countries,\u201d he said.\nMr. Karzai said that soon after the election he would hold a grand tribal gathering, which would include members of the Taliban and other opposition groups, to find a political solution to the war.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/asia/11afghan.html", "title": "Taliban Seize Building for Attack on Afghan Government Offices", "author": "ABDUL WAHEED WAFA and CARLOTTA GALL"}

{"date": "Mon, 14 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ALEPPO, Syria \u2014 Ever since Syria and Turkey lifted their visa restrictions in September, Turkish visitors have poured into this picturesque northern city. Hawkers in Aleppo\u2019s ancient souk now call out to shoppers in Turkish, and cross-border commerce has soared. The two countries have embarked on a very public honeymoon, with their leaders talking about each other like long-lost friends.\nBut this reconciliation is about far more than trade, or the collapse of old Turkish-Arab enmities. At a time of economic and political uncertainty here, the new warmth with Turkey has stirred hopes about Syria\u2019s future direction, in areas that include religion, oil and gas, and peace with Israel.\nFor some here, the new closeness with secular, moderate Turkey represents a move away from Syria\u2019s controversial alliance with Iran. For others, it suggests an embrace of Turkey\u2019s more open, cosmopolitan society. And for many \u2014 including Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad \u2014 it conjures different dreams of a revitalized regional economy, less vulnerable to Western sanctions or pressure.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more than an economic relationship,\u201d said Samir al-Taqi, director of the Orient Center for International Studies in Damascus. \u201cIt\u2019s about regathering the region, and a feeling that the West is much weaker, less liable to do anything here. I think Syria has lots of ambitions to redefine its geopolitical position.\u201d\nThose ambitions became apparent in October, when Syria delayed signing an economic agreement with the European Union that it had sought for years, hinting that it wanted better terms. The agreement had been initialed in 2004, when Syria felt threatened by the United States invasion of Iraq and desperate for economic and political succor. Now Syria\u2019s leaders feel far more confident, analysts say.\nThat confidence has less to do with Syria\u2019s still-ailing economy than with its political position. The West\u2019s isolation of Syria has given way to engagement, despite Syria\u2019s continuing support for the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. The United States is expected to send a new ambassador to Damascus soon, ending a long freeze in diplomatic relations.\nSyria\u2019s relationship with Turkey \u2014 which has been slowly warming for years \u2014 helped bring about this political realignment. Turkey mediated indirect talks between Syria and Israel in 2008, fostering renewed hopes in the West for a peace deal.\nBut the widespread notion that Turkey will draw Syria toward moderation and a regional peace deal may be something of a fantasy, albeit a useful one. Turkey\u2019s alliance with Israel has cooled noticeably since Israel\u2019s war in Gaza a year ago, which provoked outrage in the region and reaffirmed the political value of Syria\u2019s ties to Hamas. Israel expressed interest in restarting indirect talks with Syria this month, but many here are skeptical. Syria is keenly aware of the backlash it might face from domestic radicals \u2014 or even from Iran \u2014 if it drew closer to Israel.\nInstead, the new Turkish alliance may be valuable precisely because it helps Syria hint at change while keeping its options open, said Peter Harling, a senior Damascus-based analyst with the International Crisis Group, and lead author of a report on Syria\u2019s foreign policy published Monday.\n\u201cIn a region full of unresolved conflicts, Syria has chosen to hedge its bets,\u201d Mr. Harling said. \u201cAligning with Turkey helps Syria to offset competing pressures from Iran and the West while strengthening its position economically.\u201d\nBut the relationship is not just about providing Syria with political cover. Mr. Assad, the Syrian president, has made clear that he hopes to foster a regional energy network, building on Turkey\u2019s natural gas pipelines. Trade between the countries doubled between 2007 and 2008, and doubled again in 2009, to an estimated $4 billion, according to the Aleppo Chamber of Commerce.\n\u201cI think there is a sort of vision developing between Syria and Turkey where they could serve jointly as a regional trade hub, linking Europe with the Gulf and other parts of the East,\u201d said Nabil Sukkar, a Damascus-based economic analyst.\nIt is too soon to tell how far that vision will go, or whether Syria will start to feel swamped by imports from Turkey\u2019s more powerful economy. In the meantime, the political opening has corresponded to a real social and cultural rediscovery, with Turks and Arabs warming to each other after long years of hostility. Syria, after all, was born out of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s dismemberment in 1920, and its identity was built in large part on the rejection of its former masters in Istanbul.\nOn a popular level, there was bitter resentment over Turkey\u2019s annexation of the Arabic-speaking Hatay district, which had been Syrian. As recently as 1998 the two countries were on the brink of war over Syria\u2019s support for Kurdish rebels. Relations improved slowly after Syria expelled Abdullah Ocalan, the rebel leader.\nThe thaw has accelerated strikingly in recent months, with Turkish journalists writing glowing accounts of their travels here. Many Syrians say Turkey feels much closer to them culturally than Iran or Saudi Arabia, two important allies of recent decades. Turkish films and television shows are often dubbed into Syrian Arabic and become huge hits here. One film, \u201cValley of the Wolves: Iraq,\u201d portrayed Turkish agents taking revenge on American soldiers for massacres carried out on Arabs in Iraq, in a neat parable of recent policy shifts.\nFor Syrians, the warmth is partly aspirational: many hope that Turkey\u2019s gradual shift over the past decade from military autocracy to a more democratic and tolerant political system will be replicated here. For the moment, they must be content with having new friends.\n\u201cBefore, we were afraid to come here,\u201d said Omer Sonmez, a Turkish businessman who first visited Syria three months ago, and now crosses over regularly to trade roasted pumpkin seeds and other foods. \u201cWe thought it would all be so closed, with no women on the street. But when you talk to Europeans, they say the same thing about Turkey!\u201d\n\u201cAnd look,\u201d Mr. Sonmez added, glancing around at the crowds emerging from Aleppo\u2019s covered market. \u201cWe are not so different. Even our faces are similar.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/world/middleeast/15syria.html", "title": "Relations With Turkey Kindle Hopes in Syria", "author": "ROBERT F. WORTH"}

{"date": "Tue, 07 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 The relative freedom of a newly democratic Iraq and the recent improvement in security have allowed a gay subculture to flourish here. The response has been swift and deadly.\nIn the past two months, the bodies of as many as 25 boys and men suspected of being gay have turned up in the huge Shiite enclave of Sadr City, the police and friends of the dead say. Most have been shot, some multiple times. Several have been found with the word \u201cpervert\u201d in Arabic on notes attached to their bodies, the police said.\n\u201cThree of my closest friends have been killed during the past two weeks alone,\u201d said Basim, 23, a hairdresser. \u201cThey had been planning to go to a cafe away from Sadr City because we don\u2019t feel safe here, but they killed them on the way. I had planned to go with them, but fortunately I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nBasim, who preferred to be called \u201cBasima\u201d \u2014 the feminine version of his name \u2014 wears his hair long for Iraq. It falls to just below the ear. His ears are pierced, uncommon for Iraqi males. White makeup covers his face, a popular look for gay men in Sadr City who say they prefer light skin.\nThough risky, his look is one result of the overall calm here that has allowed Iraqis to enjoy freedoms unthinkable two years ago: A growing number of women walk the streets unveiled, a few even daring to wear dresses above the knee. Families gather in parks for cookouts, and more people have begun to venture out at night.\nBut that has not changed the reality that Iraq remains religious, conservative \u2014 and still violent. The killers, the police say, are not just Shiite death squads, but also tribal and family members shamed by their gay relatives. (And the recent spate of violence has seemed aimed at more openly gay men, rather than homosexuality generally.)\nClerics in Sadr City have urged followers to help root out homosexuality in Iraqi society, and the police have begun their own crackdown on gay men.\n\u201cHomosexuality is against the law,\u201d said Lt. Muthana Shaad, at a police station in the Karada district, a neighborhood that has become popular with gay men. \u201cAnd it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\nFor the past four months, he said, officers have been engaged in a \u201ccampaign to clean up the streets and get the beggars and homosexuals off them.\u201d\nGay men, he said, can be arrested only if they are seen engaging in sex, but the police try to drive them away. \u201cThese people, we make sure they can\u2019t get together in a coffee shop or walk together in the street \u2014 we make them break up,\u201d he said.\nGay men and lesbians in Iraq have long been among the targets of both Shiite and Sunni death squads, but their murders have been overshadowed by the hundreds of overall weekly casualties during the height of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007.\nIn 2005, the country\u2019s most influential Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, issued a religious decree that said gay men and lesbians should be \u201cpunished, in fact, killed.\u201d He added, \u201cThe people should be killed in the worst, most severe way of killing.\u201d The language has since been removed from his Web site.\nIn recent months, groups of gay men have been taking greater chances, gathering in cafes and other public places in Baghdad, Basra, Najaf and other cities. On a recent night in Sadr City, several, their hair parted down the middle, talked as they quietly sipped tea at a garishly lighted cafe, oblivious to the stares of passers-by.\nBasim, who would not give his last name out of fear for his safety, said he knew at least 20 young men from Sadr City\u2019s large but hidden gay community who had disappeared during the past two months. He said he had learned later that each was found dead. After three of his friends were killed, he stayed inside his house for a week. Recently he has begun to go out again.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay at home all day,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to see my friends.\u201d\nPublicly, the Iraqi police have acknowledged only the deaths of six gay men in the neighborhood. But privately, police officials say the figure is far higher.\nThe chief of a Sadr City police station, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to reporters, said family members had probably committed most of the Sadr City killings. He played down the role of death squads that had once been associated with the Mahdi Army, the militia that controlled Sadr City until American and Iraqi forces dislodged them last spring.\n\u201cOur investigation has found that these incidents are being committed by relatives of the gays \u2014 not just because of the militias,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are killing them because it is a shame on the family.\u201d\nHe said families typically refused to cooperate with the investigation or even to claim the bodies. No arrests have been made in the killings.\nAt the same time, though, clerics associated with Moktada al-Sadr, an anti-American cleric with significant influence in Sadr City, have devoted a portion of Friday Prayer services to inveighing against homosexuality.\n\u201cThe community should be purified from such delinquent behavior like stealing, lying and the effeminacy phenomenon among men,\u201d Sheik Jassem al-Mutairi said during his sermon last Friday. Homosexuality, he said, was \u201cfar from manhood and honesty.\u201d\nAbu Muhaned al-Diraji, a Sadrist official in Sadr City, said the clerics were in no way encouraging people to kill gay men.\n\u201cAll we are doing is giving advice to people to take care of their sons,\u201d Mr. Diraji said.

{"date": "Mon, 16 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 It was a signal moment in Pakistan\u2019s political development: A huge demonstration forced the restoration of a dismissed chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, a symbol of democracy and the rule of law. The army did not stage a coup, but insisted that the government accept a compromise.\nThe deal between President Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif, the leader of the main opposition party, does not herald a solution to the instability of this nuclear-armed nation. Nor does it ensure the Obama administration\u2019s primary objective of tamping down the powerful Islamic insurgency that threatens both Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nHow the two Pakistani politicians will resolve their rivalry is but one of many uncertainties. Another is whether the domestic political struggle will allow them \u2014 or the military \u2014 to focus on their country\u2019s deteriorating security situation.\nPresident Zardari has been severely weakened by his efforts to squelch a national protest and faces defections from the usually cohesive Pakistan Peoples Party. His opponent, Mr. Sharif, emerged as a leader in waiting, but with no clear path to power.\nThe way ahead is likely to be messy for everyone, including the United States, and could turn out to be a major distraction from efforts to counter the insurgency, which is spreading closer to the main population areas.\nBut there was hope, American and Pakistani officials pointed out. For a country that has more experience with military rule than with democratic government in its 61 years, there was the possibility that the outpouring of civil society on the streets of Lahore over the weekend presaged a strengthened two-party democratic system, and the beginnings of an independent judiciary.\nMr. Sharif, often held in suspicion in Washington because of his leaning toward Islamic conservatives, was more cooperative than had been thought, some United States officials suggested.\nIn Washington, there was an awareness that Mr. Sharif\u2019s reputation from the Bush administration of being too close to the Islamists might be overdrawn, and that his relationships with some of the Islamic parties and with Saudi Arabia could be useful, said a foreign policy expert familiar with the thinking of the Obama administration on Pakistan.\nMr. Sharif has told people that he got along well with the Obama administration\u2019s special envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, during their meeting at Mr. Sharif\u2019s farm last month.\nHe speaks admiringly of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom he met with former President Bill Clinton while in exile in Saudi Arabia.\nPakistani analysts, too, said Mr. Sharif could prove to be a useful partner as Washington tried to talk to what it considered reconcilable elements in the Taliban.\n\u201cWho from Pakistan can talk to a faction of the Taliban? It\u2019s Nawaz,\u201d said a senior Pakistani politician who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating Mr. Sharif.\nBut Mr. Sharif has to play a delicate game because if he is seen as doing Washington\u2019s bidding, he will be discredited among much of his constituency, the politician said.\nAnd Mr. Sharif could also turn out to be unwilling to back some of the tough steps that Washington wants.\nOne encouraging sign for Washington was the role played in the crisis by the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who let Mr. Zardari know that he could not rely on soldiers to confront the protesters who were threatening to descend on Islamabad to demand the return of Chief Justice Chaudhry.\n\u201cThe military acted to avert, to correct and to clear the way for full democracy with the center of gravity where it should be \u2014 in Parliament and the people,\u201d said Jehangir Karamat, a retired general and former Pakistani ambassador to Washington, in an article for Spearheadresearch.org, his Web site.\nGeneral Karamat called the new military approach the Kayani Model, after General Kayani, whom General Karamat is close to. During the crisis, the army chief had been \u201cinvisible but around, fully informed and acting through well-timed and effective influence in the right quarter,\u201d General Karamat wrote.\nAnother positive sign was the nature of the support Mr. Sharif garnered after he drove out of his house in a suburb of Lahore on Sunday through barbed-wire barriers, in defiance of a detention order.\nAs his bulletproof four-wheel-drive vehicle entered the main thoroughfare of Lahore, it was showered with pink rose petals from the crowd, made up of lawyers, party workers and couples who came with their children to join what turned out to be a celebration of Mr. Sharif\u2019s nerve.\nOne man in the crowd, Shakeel Ahmad, a laborer, clutched the hand of his 4-year-old son, Muhammad Ahsan. \u201cI am happy if the judiciary is restored,\u201d Mr. Ahmad said.\nThe support of such a broad range of people is considered a first for Mr. Sharif\u2019s party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, which has generally ceded street power to the Pakistan Peoples Party, and it underscored Mr. Sharif\u2019s political instincts, said Farrukh Saleem, a columnist for The News, a daily newspaper.\n\u201cHe understood the pulse of the country,\u201d Mr. Saleem said.\nThose political instincts could serve the Obama administration well if Mr. Sharif continues to work with lawyers and civil society.\nOne of the senior advisers to President Obama on Pakistan, Bruce O. Riedel, now the chairman of the administration\u2019s policy review on Pakistan and Afghanistan, has repeatedly said that representative government and civil society need to be reinforced in Pakistan for its people to resist the siren call of the jihadists.\nOn Monday, a suicide bomber attacked a busy bus terminal in Rawalpindi, outside the Pakistani capital, killing at least 9 people and wounding 18, Pakistani officials said.\nIn an interview last week, Mr. Sharif, referring to the terrorist threat, said \u201cno single party has the ability to deal with this situation single-handedly.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole nation has to get together; it has to be a united front,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking for the government, the new minister for information, Qamar Zaman Kaira, said Monday that it was time for the nation to forget the crisis of the past weeks and to look forward.\nUnder the deal announced Monday, Mr. Kaira said, the Pakistan Peoples Party would embark on discussions with Mr. Sharif\u2019s party on a range of political reforms proposed under the Charter of Democracy, a document signed by Mr. Sharif in 2006 with Benazir Bhutto, the leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, who was assassinated in 2007.\nMr. Zardari is the widower of Ms. Bhutto.\nA major element of the charter involves getting the major parties to end attempts to undermine each other\u2019s governments.\nFrom Washington\u2019s point of view, such a lofty result would be helpful as it tried to convince Pakistan that the insurgency, not internal politics, was the most important challenge.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/world/asia/17pstan.html", "title": "Pakistan Avoids Pitfall, but Path Ahead Is Unclear", "author": "JANE PERLEZ"}

He offered a different casualty toll, saying three children had been killed and four wounded after a sustained firefight. He said provincial officials had already pleaded with troops not to carry out raids where civilians were present.\nThe deaths come amid growing complaints from Afghan officials, including President Hamid Karzai, about civilian casualties. The officials have said that plans by the United States-led military alliance in Afghanistan to add as many as 30,000 more American troops could lead to more fatalities.\nAfghan leaders will press their case over the next few days with Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration\u2019s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, who arrived in Afghanistan on Thursday after visiting Pakistan. By the time he leaves, he is expected to have met with Mr. Karzai and perhaps a dozen other Afghan political leaders and lawmakers, as well as with United Nations and American and NATO officials.\nA statement by the Australian military Friday about the Oruzgan deaths said the Australian troops began shooting after they were attacked by Taliban insurgents. \u201cA number of people have been killed and wounded during this incident,\u201d the statement said. In addition to the five children, a \u201csuspected insurgent\u201d was killed and two children and two civilians were also wounded, the statement said. None of the Australians were hurt.\nThe Australian military said it had initiated an investigation but that its troops had operated \u201cin accordance with the rules of engagement.\u201d A senior Australian military official, Lt. Gen. Mark Evans, declined to answer questions from reporters about how so many children could die in one attack, or whether the children were killed by shots fired on the ground or whether they died from an airstrike called in by the troops. The military also provided no immediate information about the ages of the children.\nGovernor Hamdam said he did not know the condition of the wounded children. He said they had been taken for treatment to Kandahar Province.\nHe said the Australian forces \u201cclaimed that they had killed one Taliban commander, then we later found out that three children were killed in cross-fire in one of the houses.\u201d\n\u201cThis kind of killing actually brings negative effects on the thoughts of residents of Oruzgan,\u201d he said.\nIn a separate attack, the American military command in Kabul said a serviceman had also been killed in Oruzgan Province on Thursday. The service member, whose military branch was not identified, was killed by \u201cenemy fire during a combat reconnaissance patrol,\u201d the military said.

But the Israeli Army prevented the group from entering Yasuf for security reasons as enraged villagers proclaimed that the visitors would not be welcome.\n\u201cThe people will not allow it,\u201d said Wasfi Hassan, a local farmer. \u201cIt is like killing a man, then going to his funeral.\u201d\nAn acrid odor hung in the air outside the mosque on Sunday. Inside, a pile of cinders marked the spot where holy books had apparently been emptied off library shelves and burned; words were still legible on some loose, singed pages of the Koran.\nThe walls were charred, and a black groove snaked across the carpet of the prayer hall to a back wall, following the arsonists\u2019 gasoline trail. Hussam Abd al-Fattah, the muezzin at a small nearby mosque, said that worshipers spotted the fire on Friday as they returned from dawn prayers, and that neighbors rushed in to help extinguish the flames.\nOn the front stoop of the mosque, the vandals left graffiti in Hebrew that read, \u201cPrice tag \u2014 Greetings from Effi.\u201d\nPrice tag is the name of a provocative policy developed by some radical settlers last year. It calls for settlers and their supporters to respond to any move by the Israeli authorities against the settlements or illegal outposts, usually by attacking Palestinian property. The villagers assume the attack was meant as revenge for the Israeli government\u2019s recently declared temporary moratorium on new building in Jewish settlements in the West Bank.\nEffi, a Hebrew nickname for Efraim, is also an acronym for a far-rightist group.\nMunir Abbushi, the Palestinian Authority governor of the Salfit region, which includes Yasuf, a village of about 2,000 people, said there were at least 23 settlements built in the region. He said the Israeli government \u201csupports the settlers day and night.\u201d\nMr. Abbushi rejected the notion that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could turn into a religious struggle. \u201cIt is a national conflict. We want an independent state, without settlers,\u201d he said.\nBut Palestinian schoolchildren brought to demonstrate in Yasuf on Sunday shouted, \u201cKhaibar, Khaibar ya Yahud,\u201d evoking a legendary battle between the Prophet Muhammad and the Jews of the Khaibar oasis, who were forced to surrender.\nOver the weekend Israeli leaders harshly condemned the attack on the mosque. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was \u201cno place for violence of any sort, neither Jews against Palestinians nor Palestinians against Jews.\u201d He said he had ordered the security services to try to \u201capprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice as quickly as possible.\u201d\nPresident Shimon Peres called the arson a \u201cgrave act\u201d that \u201cstands against all the values of the State of Israel.\u201d\nThe chief rabbi of Israel planned to visit Yasuf on Monday.\nMainstream settler leaders also condemned the desecration of the mosque. But the Samaria Regional Council, which represents the northern settlements, questioned the widespread assumption that it was perpetrated by Jews.\nIn Yasuf, villagers recounted years of problems with settlers in the area, blaming them for a range of ills, including what they said was the poisoning of a spring and the theft of sheep.\nSince the Jewish delegation could not enter the village on Sunday, Mr. Abbushi, the district governor, went to the nearest army checkpoint to meet them. Led by Rabbi Menachem Froman of the settlement of Tekoa, a fervent advocate of Jewish-Arab coexistence, the group sang a traditional song of Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of lights, which is being celebrated now, about banishing the darkness.\nThe Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, on Sunday ordered the removal of a religious seminary in the Samarian settlement of Har Bracha from a government-approved program that combines army service and Torah study, because the rabbi of the seminary encouraged his students to refuse any orders to evacuate settlements.\nAlso on Sunday, the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to change Israel\u2019s map of national priority areas to include several isolated West Bank settlements, along with large areas populated by Jews and Arabs in the country\u2019s north and south. The plan has been sharply criticized by the Israeli left because of the inclusion of the settlements, which will now be entitled to additional government financing.\nMany Israelis saw the adjusted map as an attempt by the government to appease the settlers, who are furious about the building halt.\nSaeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said in a statement that the new map \u201cserves as a blueprint for future settlement expansion.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cIt reveals the extent to which Israel\u2019s \u2018settlement moratorium\u2019 is a sham.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/world/middleeast/14mideast.html", "title": "West Bank Is Tense After Arson at Mosque", "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER"}

Specifically, Mr. Leylaz was accused of having dealings with Hossein Rassam, an Iranian employed as a political analyst at the British Embassy, who was sentenced in October to four years in prison for fomenting violence.\nMr. Leylaz was also charged with keeping classified documents at his home, apparently because he had in his possession a public report issued by Parliament that had been posted on the Internet, his lawyer said.\nMr. Leylaz is one of more than 100 journalists, activists and former officials who were arrested in the protests that erupted after the June 12 presidential election. In recent months, they have been subjected to show trials broadcast over state-run television.\n\u201cWe believe that the sentences are extremely disproportionate to the charges,\u201d said Saleh Nikbakht, a lawyer who has defended several high-profile detainees. \u201cThey are giving five years of jail to the detainees who took part in the protests. This is the maximum punishment only if the accused has repeatedly committed a banned action.\u201d\nA politician, Behzad Nabavi, 68, a former deputy speaker of Parliament, was sentenced last week to six years in prison. He was released on $800,000 bail for surgery, but he is required to return to prison next week.\nKian Tajbakhsh, 47, a scholar who was in Iran working on a book and was convicted of spying and given a 15-year sentence after the June protests, was recently served with new charges of spying, raising the possibility of an even harsher penalty.\nIran, which typically trails only China in the rate of executions, has been executing prisoners at a much greater rate since the protests began in June, human rights groups say. On Wednesday, the Human Rights Activists News Agency reported the sixth death sentence for an opposition detainee this year. The detainee, Ayub Porkar, arrested more than a year ago, was found guilty of membership in the Mujahedeen Khalq, an armed opposition group based outside the country, the news agency\u2019s Web site reported.\nNew details emerged about the mysterious death of Dr. Ramin Pourandarjani, 26, the only civilian witness at the notorious Kahrizak detention center, where at least three detainees died.\nWhile the authorities had said initially that the doctor had died of a heart attack, Tehran\u2019s prosecutor, Abbas Ja\u2019fari Dolatabadi, said Tuesday that he had been poisoned, but that it was unclear whether he was murdered or committed suicide.\nOn Wednesday, however, a member of Parliament, Masoud Pezeshkian, vigorously rejected the notion that Dr. Pourandarjani had committed suicide. \u201cHe had no psychological problems and therefore cannot be accused of committing suicide,\u201d Mr. Pezeshkian was quoted as saying on the news site Khabar Online.

{"date": "Sun, 06 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LA PAZ, Bolivia \u2014 The government of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, facing a crisis at several banks acquired by his supporters, moved over the weekend to assert greater financial control by detaining one of the country\u2019s most powerful financiers and forcing the resignation of the banker\u2019s brother, who is a minister and a top Ch\u00e1vez aide.\nThe arrest on Saturday of the financier, Arn\u00e9 Chac\u00f3n, and the removal of his brother, Jesse, as science minister, which Mr. Ch\u00e1vez announced Sunday, points to a broadening purge of a group of magnates known as Boligarchs, who built immense fortunes this decade on the back of close government ties. Their nickname is derived from the combination of Russian-style oligarchs and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the historical icon of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s political movement.\nBesides Arn\u00e9 Chac\u00f3n, Venezuelan authorities have detained several other bankers, including Ricardo Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco, a billionaire who went into finance after assembling a business empire that sold food to state-controlled supermarkets. All the bankers are believed to be under questioning by the Disip, Venezuela\u2019s intelligence secret police.\n\u201cWe have been watching in awe at everything that has gone on over the past week, from the collapse and runs on the banks to the revolution eating its own,\u201d said Russell M. Dallen Jr., who oversees capital markets operations at BBO, a Caracas investment bank.\nThe crisis in the banking system began unfolding last Monday when the government seized control of four troubled banks, including those with ties to Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco, and then seized three other banks on Friday. Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco was arrested after he could not explain the origins of money used to buy the banks.\nTogether, all the seized banks are estimated to account for less than 20 percent of the country\u2019s banking system, dimming some fear that the crisis could infect other areas of Venezuela\u2019s oil-based economy and easing concern of a Dubai-like debt crisis\u2019s happening in Venezuela.\nStill, Venezuelan markets were temporarily gripped by fear last week after Mr. Ch\u00e1vez threatened to nationalize the entire banking system if bankers did not obey the law. Capital flight fueled a plunge in the black-market value of the currency, the bol\u00edvar, and traders unloaded Venezuelan bonds before a reverse of panic selling on Friday.\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez, seeking to calm the population, said he was simply seeking to protect depositors. In his Sunday newspaper column, he reserved some vitriol for the arrested bankers, calling them \u201cvulgar thieves, white-collar robbers, pickpockets.\u201d\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s government still faces questions about the quick accumulation of fortunes by the arrested bankers, who drew deposits to their banks from deals with regional governments controlled by the president\u2019s followers, leaving open the possibility that the purge could spread.\nBankers and economists in Venezuela also said it was not clear whether underlying financial problems at the banks had pushed the government to act. Depositors nervously lined up at some financial institutions in Venezuela last week in attempts to withdraw money, heightening concern over possible bank runs.\nThe bankers embroiled in the scandal kept low profiles while expanding their empires.\nArn\u00e9 Chac\u00f3n, a former lowly army lieutenant, worked as a government tax official earlier this decade before quietly emerging as one of Venezuela\u2019s top magnates, embarking on acquisition sprees that included banks, insurers and race horses.\nJesse Chac\u00f3n, 44, also has a military background. He took part in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s unsuccessful 1992 coup attempt. Since Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s rise to power 11 years ago, he has served as communications minister, justice minister and the president\u2019s private secretary, before his most recent appointment as science minister.\nMr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco, 44, forged ties with the government during a 2002 general strike by refusing to stop supplying food to grocery stores. Expanding into trucking and banking, his fortune reached $1.6 billion by 2005, according to an assessment by the Venezuelan affiliate of KPMG, the accounting firm.\nThe rise of these magnates had become a vulnerability for Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who faced criticism from within his political movement over the seemingly unfettered operations of these decidedly capitalistic businessmen.\nFor scholars of Venezuela\u2019s economy, the emergence of such magnates has been a recurring feature of the country\u2019s political evolution since oil became the dominant industry during the last century, with bureaucrats managing oil revenue and businessmen seeking lucrative government contracts.\nThis intermingling of state and private interests did not stop during Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s government. Despite his efforts to assert greater state control over the economy, corruption in Venezuela is thriving by various measures. Transparency International, a Germany-based group that compiles a global corruption perception index, ranked Venezuela 162 out of 180 countries.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing a replay of this sudden-wealth mechanism, in which bureaucrats and businessmen become allies to capture oil revenues,\u201d said P\u00e1vel G\u00f3mez, an economist at the Institute of Superior Administrative Studies, a Caracas business school. \u201cSome of these players are now falling, but the system will allow other beneficiaries to emerge.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/world/americas/07venez.html", "title": "Venezuela Takes Greater Control of Banks", "author": "SIMON ROMERO"}
{"date": "Wed, 24 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 With a nationwide election only weeks away, the paradox of President Hamid Karzai has never seemed more apparent: he is at once deeply unpopular and likely to win.\nMr. Karzai, who has led Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, is blamed by many for the failures that have plagued the American-led mission here in the past eight years, from the resurgence of the Taliban to the explosion of the poppy trade.\nYet at the same time, Mr. Karzai enjoys a commanding lead in the race for the presidency, to be decided in a nationwide election on Aug. 20. Since the beginning of the year, Mr. Karzai has deftly outmaneuvered a once formidable array of opponents, either securing their backing or relegating them to the status of long shots.\nThose two facts \u2014 Mr. Karzai\u2019s unpopularity and the likelihood of his victory \u2014 have cast a pall of resignation over the presidential campaign here, with many Afghans preparing themselves for another five years of a leader they feel they already know too well.\nThe danger, Mr. Karzai\u2019s opponents and other leading Afghans say, is a kind of national demoralization, which will discourage Afghans from voting and dash hopes for substantial progress once the election is over.\nFor the Americans, the prospect of Mr. Karzai\u2019s re-election risks an even closer association with an unpopular president with a record of mismanagement. With the Taliban now stronger than ever \u2014 early this month, attacks reached their highest level since 2001 \u2014 a Karzai victory could threaten the American-led push to turn the war around.\n\u201cKarzai will not change, he has demonstrated that,\u201d said Ashraf Ghani, once a close friend of Mr. Karzai, who is now running against him. \u201cIf he wins, there will be a downward spiral.\u201d\nAmerican officials, who have provided indispensable support for Mr. Karzai since he first took office in 2001, have recently tried to put him at some distance. The new American ambassador, Karl W. Eikenberry, took the unusual step last week of attending news conferences of the leading challengers to Mr. Karzai, including Mr. Ghani and Dr. Abdullah, a former foreign minister, who like many Afghans uses only one name.\nThe Obama administration has reversed the previous American policy of nearly unconditional support for Mr. Karzai. President Obama has publicly chastised Mr. Karzai for his government\u2019s weakness and corruption.\nYet there is a widespread perception among Afghans that Mr. Karzai is the American favorite. Some American officials express resignation that they may be stuck with him for five more years.\nIndeed, the Obama administration appears to have begun preparing for that prospect. American officials, for instance, have done nothing to oppose the discussions between Mr. Karzai and Zalmay Khalilzad, the former American ambassador here, about Mr. Khalilzad\u2019s becoming a senior official in a new Karzai administration.\n\u201cThe Americans need to do more to distance themselves,\u201d Dr. Abdullah said. \u201cOtherwise, they will be blamed for the failures of his government by their own public as well as by ours.\u201d\nNo one expressed more surprise about the perception of American favoritism than Mr. Karzai himself. Asked about it at a recent news conference, he curtly replied, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see this change of heart.\u201d\nIt is hardly surprising that Mr. Karzai\u2019s popularity is slumping. He has been in power for eight years, and in that period hopes for a stable and prosperous Afghanistan have been frustrated.\nMr. Karzai\u2019s unpopularity was spelled out in a recent poll conducted by the International Republican Institute, a nonpartisan group supported by the American government.\nOnly 31 percent of Afghans said they would vote for Mr. Karzai again, down sharply from the 54 percent of votes he received in the 2004 election. If no candidate surpasses 50 percent of the vote, the two top vote-getters would face each other in a runoff election.\nYet the same I.R.I. survey found Mr. Karzai easily outpolling his rivals. Only 7 percent favored Dr. Abdullah and just 2 percent Mr. Ghani, and they are considered to be Mr. Karzai\u2019s most serious rivals.\nIt was not always so. Only months ago, Mr. Karzai was considered vulnerable, and his rivals were lining up to take his place.\nBut showing a deftness that has often eluded him in governing, Mr. Karzai systematically co-opted most of the Afghans who were considering running against him.\nIn neutralizing his opposition, Mr. Karzai has aggressively wielded the power of his office. With all the resources of government at his disposal, Mr. Karzai can dispatch his employees to work on his re-election, and he can use government resources, like helicopters and airplanes, to crisscross the country. No other candidate can match that.\nNor has Mr. Karzai been shy about making deals with unsavory characters, including militia commanders with reputations for brutality and corruption.\nThe horse-trading has infuriated his opponents, who accuse him of putting the Afghan government up for sale to the worst sort of people. \u201cHe is auctioning off the government,\u201d Mr. Ghani said.\nThis month, for instance, Mr. Karzai reinstated as chief of staff of the army Abdul Rashid Dostum, who was suspended last year after he was accused of storming the house of a political rival and threatening him at gunpoint.\nMr. Dostum, a former militia commander, has perhaps the most brutal reputation of any warlord, having fought for virtually every side over the past 30 years.\nIn a similar way, Mr. Karzai last month named Muhammad Qasim Fahim as one of his two vice presidential running mates. Mr. Fahim is a former commander of the Northern Alliance, the rebel group that toppled the Taliban in 2001. He has a spotted past; among other things, he is suspected of printing millions of dollars worth of Afghan currency for himself in the early days of the first post-Taliban government.\nFinally, Mr. Karzai appears to have made a brazenly explicit promise to Muhammad Mohaqeq, the leader of a large ethnic party and a former militia commander. In an interview, Mr. Mohaqeq said that Mr. Karzai had promised his group, the Islamic National Unity Party, five seats in his cabinet in exchange for his support.\n\u201cPeople are tired, yes, but they have not lost their nerve,\u201d Mr. Mohaqeq said. \u201cThere is no alternative to Karzai.\u201d\nAt a recent public appearance, Mr. Karzai was looking his typically regal self, sporting his trademark karakul hat and cape. Asked about his deals with the warlords, he was unapologetic.\nChoosing Mr. Fahim as a running mate, Mr. Karzai said, \u201cwas a decision that I made for the good of the country, for the unity of the country, for the strength of Afghanistan, in which it has a government that is Afghan and not influenced from outside.\u201d\nHe did not elaborate on whose outside influence he was concerned about.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/world/asia/25karzai.html", "title": "Afghan Leader Outmaneuvers Election Rivals", "author": "DEXTER FILKINS"}

Guebuza of the Frelimo Party far ahead of his two opponents and likely to finish with around 75 percent of the votes.\nIf the pattern holds up, and political analysts predict it will, it will be the most decisive victory in the nation\u2019s four presidential elections.\nFrelimo, with much superior financing and a tightly run organization, is also expected to win overwhelmingly in the race for seats in Parliament and provincial legislatures.\nFrelimo insiders had predicted a landslide. \u201cWe are really just competing with ourselves; our aim is to win by a margin greater than in the past,\u201d a party spokesman, Edson Macu\u00e1cua, said recently.\nMr. Guebuza, 66, is one of the nation\u2019s wealthiest businessmen. Among his main campaign slogans was \u201cWith Guebuza we will win the battle against poverty.\u201d The fight has quite a way to go. The country, with 21 million people, has per capita income of only $454, according to the World Bank.\nMozambique was once a Portuguese colony, and after independence in 1975 it became the battleground for one of Africa\u2019s most devastating civil wars. Peace finally came in 1992, and the two warring armies \u2014 Frelimo and Renamo \u2014 were transformed into competing political parties.\nFrelimo, a one-time Marxist organization that now eagerly shakes the marketplace\u2019s guiding hand, has managed to stay on top. Renamo has fallen ever further behind, and Wednesday\u2019s election could prove a backbreaker.\nThe official results may not be announced by the nation\u2019s election commission until Nov. 12. But for now, Afonso Dhlakama, Renamo\u2019s longtime leader, finds himself in a tight race for second place with Daviz Simango, a relative newcomer who started his party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement, only last March.\nExperts say the Renamo candidate is likely to pull ahead for the runner-up spot when more returns come in from the northern parts of the nation. Yet Mr. Dhlakama, who has headed Renamo for 25 years, is unlikely to make another try. In 1999, he narrowly lost the presidential election. In 2004, he was defeated by 32 percentage points. This time, the margin will be much larger.\nUnder Frelimo, Mozambique has managed to attract foreign investors eager to exploit the nation\u2019s mineral wealth. It also has become a darling of foreign donors, whose annual contributions come to an estimated $2 billion.\nMany of those donors, however, have expressed their disapproval with the way the election has been run.\nThe election commission, widely believed to be dominated by Frelimo, refused to allow the Mozambique Democratic Movement to compete for parliamentary seats in 9 of the 13 voting constituencies. It cited procedural grounds.\nMr. Simango, the mayor of the country\u2019s second-largest city, Beira, may not even manage 10 percent of the presidential vote. \u201cBut even if he gets 9 percent, it\u2019s a good start for someone who first appeared on the national stage less than a year ago,\u201d said Miguel de Brito, the country director for EISA, a group that works for democratic reforms in Africa. \u201cIt may be less of a start than Simango wanted, but it shows he has some base.\u201d\nOn Friday, in a meeting with reporters, election observers from the European Union praised the voting as \u201cwell-managed\u201d and \u201ccalm.\u201d But they too criticized the election commission for excluding so many candidates on technicalities, calling it a \u201crestriction of voter choice at the local level.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/world/africa/31mozambique.html", "title": "Mozambique Is Reporting Big Victory for President", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}

The Israeli military responded with artillery shells aimed at the source of the fire, according to an army spokeswoman. No injuries were reported on the Lebanese side.\nIsrael\u2019s northern border has been mostly quiet since a monthlong war against Hezbollah in 2006, though there have been occasional punctures of the subsequent cease-fire. Militants fired a salvo of rockets across the border in January, while Israel was engaged in its war against Hamas in Gaza in the south.\nHezbollah, a militant Shiite group, fired thousands of rockets at Israel during the 2006 war, but the group assured the Lebanese government that it was not responsible for the January attack.\nOn Saturday, too, Hezbollah denied involvement in the attack. Two rockets were launched, though only one landed in Israel.\n\u201cHezbollah has nothing to do with this attack,\u201d said Ibrahim Mussawi, a spokesman for the group, according to Agence France-Presse.\nSeveral small Palestinian and other militant groups operate in southern Lebanon and have fired rockets at Israel in the past.\nThe Lebanese prime minister, Fouad Siniora, obviously eager to maintain the fragile truce along the border, condemned the rockets and Israel\u2019s return fire.\nThe rockets, Mr. Siniora said in a statement, \u201cthreatened security and stability\u201d in the region and violated a United Nations resolution that ended the 2006 war. The Israeli artillery fire, he added, was \u201can unjustified violation of Lebanese sovereignty.\u201d\nThe Israeli military has been on alert in the north around the mid-February anniversary of the death of Imad Mugniyah, a Hezbollah commander who was killed by a car bomb in Damascus, Syria, in 2008. Hezbollah blamed Israel for the attack.\nIn Gaza, two militants were killed in an explosion on Saturday in a village near the border with Israel. The Israeli military said its troops were not engaged in any activity in the area at the time.

{"date": "Fri, 11 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Iraq\u2019s government sold development rights to two of its largest untapped oil fields at a public auction held under extraordinary security on Friday, three days after a series of coordinated bombings killed more than 100 people here in the capital.\nA partnership of Royal Dutch Shell and Petronas, a state-owned Malaysian company, won the larger field, Majnoon, in southern Iraq, which contains an estimated 12.6 billion barrels of recoverable oil.\nThe second field, Halfiya, also in the south, was won by a consortium led by China National Petroleum Company that included Petronas and Total of France. It is believed to hold some 4.1 billion barrels.\nThe auction, the second since the 2003 invasion, attracted representatives of dozens of the world\u2019s largest oil companies, including ExxonMobil, British Petroleum and Russia\u2019s Lukoil. \u201cI was nervous when I was sitting there,\u201d said Mounir Bouaziz, a vice president at Shell, after he submitted the winning bid for the Majnoon field. \u201cWe are pleased and relieved to have won this. It has taken a lot of work to get this, including months and months of study and discussions.\u201d\nThe event, shown on Iraq\u2019s state-owned television channel, was held in the Oil Ministry under security tight by even Baghdad\u2019s heavily policed standards. Helicopters circled overhead; thousands of police officers and soldiers patrolled roadways; streets within a mile of the ministry were closed to all vehicles but the convoys of armored S.U.V.\u2019s ferrying oil executives; and everyone who made it inside was subjected to body searches.\nIncreasing oil revenue is crucial for the Iraqi government, to finance security and reconstruction efforts. Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki gave optimistic introductory remarks, thanking oil executives for attending and saying their presence signaled \u201cconfidence\u201d in Iraq.\n\u201cThere is no security deterioration in Iraq, even if a security breach occurred,\u201d Mr. Maliki said. \u201cIraq is on its way to removing all its obstacles.\u201d\nThere is no question that the companies were facing disquieting issues. Political squabbling has delayed critical national elections from January until March, even as American troops are scheduled to continue withdrawing from Iraq. Because Parliament has been unable to approve a national oil law, it is unclear whether agreements reached with oil companies before the March 7 election will be recognized by a new government if Mr. Maliki fails to regain his post.\nShell\u2019s main competition for the Majnoon field came from Total, which has a long history there. Total signed an agreement with Saddam Hussein in the 1990s to develop the field, a pact that Mr. Hussein annulled in 2002. Two years ago, Total and Chevron signed an agreement to explore it.\nBut Friday, while Total and its partner, the Chinese National Petroleum Company, offered to accept a $1.75 fee for each barrel produced at Majnoon, the partnership of Shell and Petronas submitted a bid at $1.39 per barrel. While the Shell group gave a guarantee that it would produce 1.8 million barrels a day at Majnoon, the Total group pledged only about 1.4 million barrels.\nAs for the Halfiya field, the Chinese National Petroleum Company has a 50 percent stake in the winning consortium, while Total and Petronas have shares of 25 percent each.\nIf the group eventually signs a development contract with the Iraqi government, it would be the third Iraqi oil field development deal won by the Chinese company during the past year. In November 2008, it signed a contract to develop the Ahdab field southwest of Baghdad. Last month, it agreed to develop the 17.8-billion-barrel Rumalia field with British Petroleum.\nThree oil fields had no winning bidders on Friday; all are in areas where attacks remain relatively frequent, including the East Baghdad field, which lies beneath the Sadr City district. Several schoolchildren were killed in a bombing there this week.\nThe auction is to continue Saturday, with five more fields offered.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/12/world/middleeast/12iraq.html", "title": "Under Tight Security, Iraq Sells Rights to Develop 2 Oil Fields", "author": "TIMOTHY WILLIAMS"}
{"date": "Tue, 15 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TOKYO \u2014 Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama\u2019s postponement of a decision on relocating an American military base on Okinawa may be the product of domestic political considerations as much as deeply held foreign policy principles, analysts here said on Tuesday. But it promises to put new pressures on Japan\u2019s already strained ties with the United States, its closest ally.\nThe Obama administration had pressed Mr. Hatoyama\u2019s government to make a quick decision on whether to carry out a 2006 agreement between Washington and Tokyo to relocate the base, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, to a less populated part of Okinawa. On Tuesday, however, he announced that he would put off that decision until sometime next year, saying that members of his governing coalition would set up a working group to discuss the current plan and other possible sites for the base.\nOn Tuesday evening, Mr. Hatoyama seemed to suggest that he wanted a new site for the base, something that the Obama administration has resisted.\n\u201cI want to make a situation where we can search for a place other than Henoko, and if possible select it,\u201d Mr. Hatoyama told reporters, referring to the site of another base on Okinawa, Camp Schwab.\nThe row over the base has underscored the Obama administration\u2019s difficulties in finding common ground with Mr. Hatoyama\u2019s slightly left-leaning Democratic Party government, which ended a half-century of governing by the pro-American Liberal Democrats when it came to power in September. Mr. Hatoyama has also seemed to pull away from Washington by allowing the Japanese Navy\u2019s mission of refueling American warships in the Indian Ocean to end and telling Asian leaders that Japan has been overly reliant on the United States.\nAnother challenge for Washington, analysts say, has been a lack of clarity in Mr. Hatoyama\u2019s stance. While he has called for ending Japan\u2019s junior status, he has also stressed that the alliance with Washington remains the cornerstone of Japan\u2019s security. Key members of his cabinet, like Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada, are seen as centrists who favor solid ties with the United States.\nThe inconsistencies to some extent reflect internal political pressures, analysts say, as two small leftist parties in Mr. Hatoyama\u2019s coalition \u2014 whose votes he needs to pass bills in Parliament\u2019s upper house \u2014 press him to honor campaign promises to move the Futenma base off Okinawa or out of Japan.\nIn this line of thinking, the postponement was probably meant to buy time as Mr. Hatoyama looks for some middle ground or prepares to make a tough choice between Washington and his domestic allies. But the analysts warned that the delay could further irritate American officials, who have sought a quick decision on the base\u2019s relocation.\nSome of that irritation was evident in remarks by Gen. James T. Conway, the Marine Corps commandant, who told reporters in Washington on Tuesday that the delay could complicate plans to move the base.\n\u201cIf that is their decision, then I think it\u2019s unfortunate in terms of what we\u2019re attempting to plan on our end,\u201d General Conway said, according to Reuters.\nPolicy experts here said the United States had little choice but to put up with the delay. \u201cIt is up to the Obama administration now to decide whether it can endure for a few more months,\u201d said Hiroshi Nakanishi, a professor of international relations at Kyoto University. \u201cOtherwise, United States-Japan relations could get to their worst point in the postwar alliance.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Hatoyama did not say when he would make a final decision, but suggested that he wanted to do so as quickly as possible. He also said he wanted to reconvene a bilateral working group to discuss the base relocation issue. Tokyo suspended the discussions last week.\nMr. Hatoyama left open the possibility that Tokyo would still honor the 2006 agreement, which calls for relocating the Futenma air base from its current site in the city of Ginowan to Camp Schwab, a Marine base in the island\u2019s north. Japanese news reports said the government was still including the costs of relocating the base to Camp Schwab in next year\u2019s budget as it considered other locations.\nMr. Nakanishi and other analysts said the delay also risked alienating Japanese voters by raising doubts about Mr. Hatoyama\u2019s leadership, as well as his ability to handle the crucial relationship with the United States. They say Japanese political opinion opposes significant changes in the Washington alliance as Japan faces a rising China and a nuclear-armed North Korea.\nSome analysts have warned that the delay will only make a difficult political decision even harder for Mr. Hatoyama. In January, the city of Nago, where Camp Schwab is located, will hold a mayoral election. The leading candidate has vowed to reverse the city\u2019s decision to accept the air base, making it harder to go back to the 2006 agreement.\nMr. Hatoyama has sought to answer calls from Okinawans to lighten the burden of American forces on their island, where many of the 50,000 American military personnel in Japan are based. But the Obama administration has asked that the 2006 deal not be changed, because doing so could fray a larger, more complex agreement to relocate 8,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam by 2014.\nPolitical analysts say Mr. Hatoyama has few realistic options for locating the base besides Camp Schwab. That has led some analysts to wonder whether he may ultimately agree to the original location, but only after first making a show of resisting Washington.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/world/asia/16japan.html", "title": "Japan Delays Decision on Moving U.S. Marine Base", "author": "MARTIN FACKLER"}

Heavy rains at night hampered rescue efforts.\nIn the heart of Padang, with little or sometimes no help coming from the authorities, some affected neighborhoods turned to an informal network of businesses and volunteers to fill the void.\nOn one block in the city\u2019s Chinese quarter, workers at a coal concern and a truck rental company set up a base from which they dispatched much-needed earth-moving vehicles across the city. The two companies responded to private requests, usually from friends and business partners, said Budianto, 38, who supervises shipping at the coal company, Bumi Anyer Wisesa, and had no experience dealing with rescue missions.\nAside from one soldier who stood guard on a side street where a tractor had started to clear rubble on Sunday morning, officials had yet to reach the neighborhood.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no coordination with the government at all,\u201d Mr. Budianto said.\nA colleague was driving around the city, trying to assess the requests streaming in, but Mr. Budianto was unable to reach him because of erratic cellphone service.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because there\u2019s no clear command,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes someone in a damaged house will come and plead with our truck operators for help.\u201d\nNot far away, a group of church volunteers had been treating about 350 patients a day, mostly for less serious injuries. A Malaysian aid truck, apparently noticing the sign outside the volunteers\u2019 temporary facilities, stopped by with some medical supplies. It was the first time the church volunteers had received outside assistance, said Sam Soh, who was coordinating the group\u2019s efforts.\n\u201cWe are running out of food and medication,\u201d Mr. Soh said. \u201cWe can\u2019t give people less than five days of antibiotics for the medication to be effective.\u201d\nDoctors said the possibility of finding survivors was increasingly slim with each passing day. The main hospital appeared eerily quiet over the weekend.\n\u201cVery few living patients have arrived at the hospital over the weekend,\u201d said Idrus Patarussi, an official from the Indonesian Health Ministry. \u201cThe likelihood of finding any more survivors, in fact, is small.\u201d\nEmergency officials, however, remained hopeful.\n\u201cThis is still a rescue mission, not a recovery mission,\u201d said Winston Chang, chief of the United Nations\u2019 office for disaster assessment and coordination.\nAnxious family members trying to find their loved ones gathered outside the hospital\u2019s morgue to check lists of names and photographs. Doctors said that most of the bodies that had arrived so far had been identified and taken away by relatives.\n\u201cI am here to pick up my husband\u2019s body,\u201d said Titi Relawati, 45, who sobbed at the sight of her husband\u2019s photograph. Rescue workers found her husband buried inside the Ambacang Hotel, the site of the city\u2019s largest rescue effort. Scores are believed to have been buried when the seven-story hotel collapsed.\nThe authorities said that they had prepared a mass grave in a field just outside the city, but that so far it had not been used. Several mosques were said to be holding collective burial ceremonies at local cemeteries.\nAs hopes of finding survivors have faded, some have grown angry at the slow pace of rescue efforts, especially residents from more remote villages outside the city.\n\u201cThere are no medical supplies, no food, no drinks, no aid groups, no government officials \u2014 nothing,\u201d Buyung, a 33-year-old standing over his unconscious mother at the hospital in Padang, said about his home village of Tandikek, most of which lies buried beneath a landslide.\nSeveral of Mr. Buyung\u2019s family members managed to evacuate his mother, Saryani, 60, after a concrete slab struck her head. They carried her down a rural, dust-covered road until a passing car picked them up and took them nearly 50 miles to the hospital.\nMr. Chang, the United Nations coordinator, said rescue teams from Australia, Turkey and South Korea had gone north to Padang Pariaman, the rural district where Mr. Buyung\u2019s village is located, on Sunday morning.\nThe teams were planning to head into the district\u2019s remote areas, where entire villages have been buried, Mr. Chang said.\nIndonesian troops who arrived in those areas on Saturday morning were hobbled by a lack of equipment and coordination, angering residents who had been waiting for help since the quake hit Wednesday evening.\nHundreds of people caught in the landslides there were still missing, and few survivors expected to find loved ones alive.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/world/asia/05indo.html", "title": "As Authorities Struggle to Help Indonesian Quake Victims, Neighbors Fill the Void", "author": "PETER GELLING and NORIMITSU ONISHI"}

But that system has come under strain amid growing resentment by minority groups and poorer Malays.\nThe government offers bumiputra discounts on houses, scholarships and other perks. But some benefits, like government contracts and stock-market allocations, have been beyond the reach of working-class Malays.\nAnger among Chinese and Indians, the country\u2019s main minority groups, over the ethnic preferences was perhaps the main reason that the opposition made large gains in elections last year that nearly dismantled the governing coalition led by Mr. Najib\u2019s party, the United Malays National Organization.\n\u201cWe want to be fair to all communities,\u201d Mr. Najib said in a speech in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. \u201cNo one must feel marginalized.\u201d\nMr. Najib\u2019s success in rolling back the ethnic preferences will depend in large part on his ability to hold together his coalition and fend off a resurgent opposition led by Anwar Ibrahim, a former finance minister.\nMr. Anwar, who leads a diverse group of opposition parties, has promised to undo the system of ethnic preferences.\nBy positioning himself as a reformer, Mr. Najib, who came to power in April, appears to be calculating that he can stave off opposition advances and be seen as an agent of change.\n\u201cThe world is changing quickly, and we must be ready to change with it or risk being left behind,\u201d he said Tuesday.\nThe change would leave some ethnic preferences intact and come with caveats. But it would dilute one of the most important components of what is known as the New Economic Policy, introduced in 1971: the requirement that companies listing on the stock exchange sell 30 percent of their shares to ethnic Malays.\nThat requirement was scrapped for companies already listed on the stock exchange and reduced to 12.5 percent for initial public offerings. The requirement will remain in place for \u201cstrategic industries\u201d like telecommunications, water, ports and energy.\nMr. Najib also said he would lower barriers for foreign investors. The government would eliminate a special vetting process for foreign companies wanting to invest in, merge or take over a Malaysian company, he said.\n\u201cThe global economic crisis is amplifying the need to be a preferred investment destination,\u201d he added.\nMalaysia\u2019s trade-dependent economy is expected to contract by 5 percent this year.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/world/asia/01malaysia.html", "title": "Malaysia Dilutes Its System of Ethnic Preferences", "author": "THOMAS FULLER"}

South Africa\u2019s previous president, Thabo Mbeki, questioned the link between H.I.V. and AIDS, which deeply discouraged American officials who saw his nation as a crucial battleground over the disease. Nearly one out of five South African adults is H.I.V. positive.\nMr. Mbeki also refused to take a hard line against Zimbabwe, South Africa\u2019s neighbor, which has sunk into despair under the autocratic rule of its president, Robert Mugabe. Beyond that, the United States has been irked by South Africa\u2019s attempts to tone down or prevent United Nations action against Myanmar, a notorious human rights violator.\nThe American-South Africa \u201crelationship was fraught with far more difficulty than the previous administration was willing to acknowledge,\u201d said an aide to Mrs. Clinton, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe had little access and even less influence.\u201d\nBut with new administrations in both South Africa and the United States, there seemed to be a new spirit of cooperation on Friday, or at least a lot of talk about it. Mrs. Clinton called South Africa the \u201ceconomic anchor of Africa\u201d and praised the nation\u2019s strong financial sector, which she said had mostly escaped the credit crunch that plagued much of the rest of the world. \u201cFrankly, we could learn a lot from your example,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a business leader luncheon.\nBut the South Africans were vague about exactly what they might do differently after her visit. South Africa\u2019s foreign minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, said, \u201cWe promised to continue to work with the people of Zimbabwe to implement the agreement that they signed,\u201d referring to an awkward power-sharing agreement Mr. Mugabe struck with Zimbabwe\u2019s opposition after a bloody election season last year.\nAnd compared with Kenya, where thousands of people lined the street just to catch a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton ducking into her armored Chrysler, the public reaction to her arrival in South Africa was decidedly cooler.\nIt was hard to find stories about the visit in local newspapers, and at the business luncheon where she spoke, there were dozens of empty seats. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides also confided that there were complications trying to arrange a meeting with South Africa\u2019s new president, Jacob Zuma. The two are scheduled to meet Saturday, but the Clinton entourage will have to detour several hundred miles to Durban, on the Indian Ocean Coast, to see him.\nOn Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton visited the father figure of post-apartheid South Africa and a hero across the world, Nelson Mandela. It was not so much an official act as a time to see an old friend. Mr. Mandela, 91, is no longer actively engaged in African affairs, as he was during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, when he and the Clintons grew close. According to a person who witnessed the visit, he was frail and quiet as Mrs. Clinton chatted with him, holding his hand.\nAs the sun was sinking and the hills were darkening, Mrs. Clinton stood shoulder to shoulder with two patients at the AIDS clinic here. \u201cWhen I first found out my status, I felt my world was collapsing on top of me,\u201d said Simangele Ncube. \u201cBut look at me today. I stand in front of you a beautiful woman. The virus is not written in my face. But I am H.I.V. positive.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton seemed almost too moved to speak and nodded solemnly.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/world/africa/08diplo.html", "title": "Clinton Seeks South African Support on Zimbabwe", "author": "JEFFREY GETTLEMAN"}
{"date": "Wed, 08 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BONN, Germany \u2014 At the start of the United Nations climate talks here 12 days ago, the Obama administration\u2019s chief climate negotiator, Todd Stern, received a round of rowdy applause. It was the first appearance of the new negotiating team at any global meeting.\nBut by Wednesday, as the meetings drew to a close, some delegates \u2014 and even some United Nations officials \u2014 were grumbling that the United States was not moving fast enough to take action on global warming.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Stern\u2019s team offered the first broad hints of a new international climate policy for the United States, noting that more details would be submitted in a proposal to the United Nations later this month. But even in its broadest brush strokes, the American proposal differs significantly from other plans to curb carbon dioxide emissions enacted by the United Nations and the European Union.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s plan would require all countries, including developing nations like China and India, to curb greenhouse gas emissions, said Jonathan Pershing, the deputy special envoy for climate change, at a news conference. The plan\u2019s main focus is on long-range goals \u2014 as distant as 2050 \u2014 for greenhouse gas reduction.\nUnder the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, initial emission-reduction targets for the developed nations that signed the agreement were set for 2012. And most other proposals to lower emissions, including the plan in use in the European Union, focus on 2020 as an initial target. Though he praised Europe\u2019s efforts, Mr. Pershing said, \u201cU.S. policy is something we\u2019re developing at home, according to what we see as the science and political capacity.\u201d\nBut many officials here were clearly impatient. \u201cWe are still waiting for the U.S. to put its position on the table,\u201d said Michael Zammit-Cutajar, a top official of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \u201cThey have asked us to keep the door open, and it is,\u201d he said.\nMr. Pershing said that the Obama administration was working to fill in the plan. \u201cWe promise in June to come back with a much more detailed set of policies,\u201d Mr. Pershing said. Negotiations resume here on June 1.\nMr. Pershing said the United States was committed to working within the United Nations process. He suggested, however, that specifics \u2014 like how much the United States would reduce emissions, when the reductions would take place and how much money would be spent on curbing emissions \u2014 were unlikely to be forthcoming by June. \u201cThose numbers will be determined by Congress,\u201d he said. Congress has started debating legislation to curb carbon dioxide emissions through a cap-and-trade system.\nUnder the Bush administration, the United States never accepted binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 a policy that Mr. Obama promised to overturn. During the campaign, he proposed that the United States should reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and reduce levels progressively to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.\nAt the time, many environmental groups regarded the 2020 target as inadequate. The European Union has proposed reductions of between 25 and 40 percent compared with 1990 levels by 2020. Various plans floated here by China, South Africa and the Philippines would require developed countries to reduce emissions by up to 50 percent by 2020. Mr. Pershing dismissed such proposals as a \u201ca negotiating gambit.\u201d\nEven so, many said the lack of any numbers from the United States was holding up progress.\n\u201cCountries are very, very nervous to come forward without seeing the United States\u2019 numbers,\u201d said Harald Dovland, the official in charge of negotiations among countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol.\nThe Obama team held dozens of bilateral meetings here with other countries, contributing to a generally positive atmosphere.\n\u201cIts great to have them reengaged,\u201d said Keya Chatterjee, deputy director of the climate change program at WWF in Washington. \u201cBut they\u2019ve got to come back with some concrete proposals \u2014 with some goods \u2014 next time to really get the negotiations going.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/world/09climate.html", "title": "At U.N.

{"date": "Mon, 09 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 Security forces have increased patrols in central Tibet and vigilance along international borders ahead of a sensitive anniversary to guard against possible disruptions caused by followers of the Dalai Lama or Western groups advocating Tibetan independence, according to state news reports on Monday. The reports were the most detailed acknowledgment so far by the government that it has clamped down on the Tibetan regions.\nThe announcement of the increased patrols came one day before the 50th anniversary of a failed Tibetan rebellion against Chinese rule. After the 1959 revolt was suppressed, the Dalai Lama fled into exile in India.\nLast year this month, the police clamped down on a protest by Buddhist monks in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, prompting many Tibetans to riot in the streets. The uprising quickly spread to other Tibetan areas of China, becoming the largest- scale Tibetan rebellion against Chinese rule in decades.\nThe Chinese government fears the same thing could happen again this year, and it has been flooding Tibetan regions across western China with troops and police officers, creating an unofficial state of martial law. Foreigners have been barred from many areas.\nIn the uprising last year, at least 19 people were killed in Lhasa, most of them Han Chinese civilians, according to the Chinese government. In the ensuing crackdown, 220 Tibetans were killed, nearly 1,300 were injured and nearly 7,000 were detained or imprisoned, according to the Tibetan government-in-exile, which is based in Dharamsala, India. More than 1,000 Tibetans are still missing.\nEarly Monday, a police car and a fire engine parked in a timber farm in a Tibetan area of Qinghai Province were attacked with homemade explosives early Monday, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The emergency lights and roofs of the vehicles were destroyed, Xinhua reported, but no one was injured.\nThe attack occurred after forest police officers stopped a local timber truck on Sunday at a checkpoint to inspect cargo and licenses, Xinhua said. That led to an argument between the people in the truck and the police, which then resulted in dozens of local residents protesting at the police station.\nThe protest broke up at midnight. About two hours later, the explosives detonated, damaging the government vehicles, Xinhua reported. It was unclear if the conflict had political motives.\nSimmering resentment at Chinese rule has manifested itself in various ways in recent weeks. In late February, many of China\u2019s six million Tibetans chose not to celebrate Losar, the Tibetan New Year, to mourn those who suffered during the unrest last year. Monks and nuns have held protests in Tibetan areas of Gansu and Sichuan provinces. One monk in northern Sichuan set himself on fire in a marketplace.\nOfficials have been quick to blame such incidents on what they call the \u201cDalai clique.\u201d A senior Tibetan official said on Sunday that the increased patrols in the Tibet Autonomous Region were temporary measures aimed at foiling separatist plots by the Dalai Lama\u2019s followers.\n\u201cThis year, they have intensified secessionist activities, trying to collude with their agents in Tibet,\u201d said the official, Legqog, chairman of the standing committee of the Regional People\u2019s Congress, according to China Daily, the country\u2019s main English-language newspaper.\nLegqog, who like many Tibetans goes by one name, was speaking to reporters while attending the annual meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing.\nThe Chinese government accuses the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, of encouraging separatism, but the Dalai Lama says he advocates genuine autonomy for all ethnic Tibetan areas of China, not secession.\nA senior Chinese police official said Monday that security was also being tightened along the border areas of the Tibet Autonomous Region. The official, Fu Hongyu, political commissar of the border control department of the Ministry of Public Security, said that security forces \u201cwill firmly crack down on criminal activities in Tibet\u2019s border area that pose a threat to China\u2019s sovereignty and government,\u201d Xinhua reported.\nThe Tibet Autonomous Region has international borders with Nepal, India, Myanmar and Bhutan.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/world/asia/10tibet.html", "title": "China Tightens Security in Tibet", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

{"date": "Thu, 09 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SAN JOS\u00c9, Costa Rica \u2014 Prospects for a quick resolution of the political crisis in Honduras were thrown into doubt Thursday, as the two men claiming their nation\u2019s presidency left negotiations only hours after they had begun and showed no signs of budging from the positions that have divided the country.\nBoth men had come here to discuss ways of breaking the standoff at the behest of President \u00d3scar Arias of Costa Rica, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped guide Central America out of its cold war conflicts.\nBut in the end, the two rivals \u2014 Manuel Zelaya, the ousted Honduran president, and Roberto Micheletti, the man who succeeded him at the helm of the nation\u2019s de facto government \u2014 left the talks at Mr. Arias\u2019s home without meeting face to face, a move Mr. Arias had hoped might help soften their positions.\n\u201cThe fact that Mr. Micheletti is leaving and that he wouldn\u2019t sit down face to face with Zelaya is bad news,\u201d said Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice president of Costa Rica who is now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of the talks, if they\u2019re not going to talk?\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Arias said the president, a veteran at moving political mountains, was far from discouraged. She said that the fact the two sides had agreed to talk was itself a sign of progress, that President Arias had frank and open discussions with both Mr. Zelaya and Mr. Micheletti, and that although both men refused to meet face to face, their delegations met through much of the evening.\n\u201cWe hardly see this as a failure,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cNow the hard work begins.\u201d\nEven before the meetings with Mr. Arias, the public statements of the two opponents made it clear that a deal would not come easily.\nUpon arriving in Costa Rica on Wednesday, Mr. Zelaya, wearing his signature cowboy hat, told reporters he had not come to negotiate, but to set the terms of his return to power.\nFor his part, Mr. Micheletti, speaking from Honduras on Wednesday, said his government would not accept Mr. Zelaya\u2019s return as president under any circumstance.\nMr. Arias seemed to acknowledge the difficulty ahead, saying at his own news conference on Wednesday, \u201cIn two days there could be a solution, or it could be that in two months there is no solution.\u201d\nThe tensions were no less evident among the protesters outside his home.\nBeyond a metal barricade blocking the driveway and the street in front, a few hundred people burned Mr. Micheletti in effigy while they derided him as \u201cGoriletti\u201d \u2014 a play on the Spanish word for gorilla \u2014 and chanted: \u201cHonduras, hold on. The people will rise up.\u201d When they first thought Mr. Micheletti was coming out of the house they shouted, \u201cAsesino,\u201d or assassin.\nMr. Arias met with the parties separately in his wood-paneled den, his aides said, first with Mr. Zelaya and later with Mr. Micheletti. Mr. Arias\u2019s aides said he had wanted to sit both delegations down together, but could not.\nEach delegation seemed determined merely to vent its own views, rather than explore areas where there might be room for compromise, said a former government official close to Mr. Arias.\nMr. Zelaya, he said, came with only one demand \u2014 a return to power \u2014 and left after about an hour and a half.\nMr. Micheletti spent about three hours with Mr. Arias, but the former official said he spent most of the time repeating his arguments defending Mr. Zelaya\u2019s ouster as legal, even though nations the world over have condemned it as a coup.\nMr. Arias has faced tough negotiations before. In 1987, when Central America was in the throes of interlocking civil wars, Mr. Arias, who was president of Costa Rica then as well, won a series of trade-offs that are credited with persuading armed insurgents to put down their weapons and opening the region\u2019s political system so that opposition groups could participate.\n\u201cHe placed democracy as a key part of the negotiations,\u201d said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.\nThe current crisis, however, stemmed from fears that a democratically elected president had strayed from governing democratically.\nMr. Zelaya\u2019s opponents accused him of trying to undermine the Constitution in order to extend his time in office. That accusation led to his arrest and removal from the country nearly two weeks ago.\nAnd now, political observers said, while a swift resolution seems to be in Mr. Zelaya\u2019s interests, Mr. Micheletti seems determined to hold on to power until his country\u2019s planned elections in November.\n\u201cIn a mediation, it is not the mediator who sets the agenda, it\u2019s the parties involved,\u201d said Alexander L\u00f3pez, the director of international relations at the National University of Costa Rica. \u201cThis is not something that happens from one day to the next. It is going to take time.\u201d\n\u201cThe dialogue has started,\u201d Mr. Micheletti said upon leaving the talks. When asked how he felt about them, he rushed back to the microphone and said, \u201cI am very satisfied.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/world/americas/10honduras.html", "title": "Honduran Rivals Leave Negotiations Without Meeting Face to Face", "author": "GINGER THOMPSON"}

And it had been a long day in Africa.\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was onstage in Kinshasa, Congo\u2019s shabby capital, in an auditorium packed with Congolese students.\nAnd then came the question, from a young man in a suit.\n\u201cMrs. Clinton, we\u2019ve all heard about the Chinese contracts in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe interference is from the World Bank against this contract. What does Mr. Clinton think through the mouth of Mrs. Clinton?\u201d\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s answer on Monday has quickly become the No. 1 sound bite from her trip. Her whole seven-nation Africa tour, which has had quite serious intentions, like combating Congo\u2019s appalling rape epidemic and raising her personal profile within President Obama\u2019s administration, may end up being reduced to this:\n\u201cWait, you want me to tell you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband.\u201d\nAlmost immediately, her showdown with the student became a media phenomenon, with a level of attention on an American in Kinshasa perhaps not seen since the so-called Rumble in the Jungle between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in 1974.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s aides have been notably frustrated that this brief flash of anger, or undiplo-speak, has come to overshadow a trip that took weeks of planning and was intended to strengthen America\u2019s ties to some of its most strategic allies on the continent.\nBut her evident irritation at the question quickly fueled speculation that Mrs. Clinton felt eclipsed by former President Bill Clinton\u2019s trip to North Korea last week, in which he rapidly secured the release of two American journalists who had been sentenced to years of hard labor.\nAfter the forum, her aides told the traveling press corps that there might have been a mistranslation, and that the student actually wanted to know the opinion of her boss, not her husband. But that interpretation did not dispel the controversy either, since it gave new life to the nagging question of whether Mrs. Clinton felt marginalized in the Obama administration.\nHer talk with the students had started out friendly enough, with questions about human rights and the environment. But it got a little edgy when several students pushed her on why Congo, whose first prime minister was ousted with the help of the C.I.A., should now trust the United States. She then became a little prickly.\nLater, her aides released the transcript of the question, as it had been translated to English from French, and further inspection of the audio recording of the event indicated that the translation was fine; the student had indeed said \u201cMr. Clinton.\u201d\nAfter the event, the student apologized to Mrs. Clinton, saying he had indeed meant to ask what Mr. Obama thought.\nEither way, the hubbub seemed to drain Mrs. Clinton. Until then, she had seemed impervious to the jet lag that was stalking her entourage from the moment they plopped down in Kenya. But on Tuesday, especially after meeting Congolese rape victims and touring a squalid refugee camp where thousands of people lived cheek by sunken cheek, Mrs. Clinton seemed enervated. Perhaps it was the sight of so many civilians suffering from a conflict the world has failed to stop. She said a few words on the plane ride back from Congo, but her language was not as emotional as it had been, or as urgent.\nNo matter the issues she was talking about \u2014 encouraging good governing, ending Africa\u2019s wars, lifting women up from their lowly position in a place like Congo. The interest in this trip, it seemed, was not about the problems facing Africa. It was about her.\nAs one journalist covering her trip put it: \u201cShe is a celebrity. We have a celebrity secretary of state.

{"date": "Fri, 16 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING\nFOR nearly two decades, the Communist Party strove to wipe out the national memory of Zhao Ziyang, the reform-minded party secretary who opposed the use of force against pro-democracy protesters in 1989.\nSo when a former aide of Mr. Zhao\u2019s, Du Daozheng, disclosed in May that he had helped secretly record Mr. Zhao\u2019s memoir for posthumous publication, Mr. Du\u2019s daughter refused to let him walk outside alone for fear of possible repercussions.\nShe need not have worried. On June 25, a top official in charge of propaganda showed up at Mr. Du\u2019s western Beijing apartment with a reassuring message from Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the Communist Party and the government. Mr. Du said he was told that, as an old friend of Mr. Zhao\u2019s, \u201cZhongnanhai and party central can understand why you did this.\u201d\nMr. Du used to be among those who delivered such judgments. Until he was ousted in 1989 with Mr. Zhao, he served as head of the government\u2019s press and publications administration, an agency that helps enforce censors\u2019 orders.\nNow he spends his days jousting with such officials, trying to foist unmentionable topics like Mr. Zhao\u2019s career into the public domain. Helping with Mr. Zhao\u2019s memoir \u2014 a rare look at the party\u2019s inner conflicts that was published this May outside China \u2014 was a particularly daring thrust.\nBut strategic ventures into forbidden territory are characteristic of his monthly scholarly journal, Yanhuang Chunqiu. In 2005, he published articles on Hu Yaobang, the former party leader whose death helped set off the Tiananmen protests. Infuriated authorities threatened to reduce copies of the magazine to pulp, according to Mr. Du\u2019s daughter, Du Mingming.\nAfter a string of journal articles last year touched on Mr. Zhao\u2019s accomplishments, party authorities issued an internal regulation so precisely focused that it could have been named after Mr. Du. The order forbids retired government or party officials to serve as publication directors.\nParty sources say Jiang Zemin, the now-retired leader who replaced Mr. Zhao, was irritated by the articles and instigated the pressure on Mr. Du to step down. Sitting in the magazine\u2019s musty offices, Mr. Du said he dealt with the order by reshuffling titles.\n\u201cI just ignore it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am old enough and tough enough that if there is any pressure from the government, I can hold on here.\u201d\nMR. Du survives such skirmishes because he is 86, wily and quietly supported by certain party luminaries. He says as many as 100 former party officials back his magazine\u2019s attempts to draw lessons from the party\u2019s buried past and nudge it toward democratic reforms. Some current officials also sympathize with the effort, he suggests. \u201cNobody dares close it,\u201d he said, lest that provoke a reaction from \u201cold cadres.\u201d Last year supporters promised him, \u201cIf the magazine closes, we will take to the streets,\u201d he said.\nThey said: \u201cWe are old. We are in our 80s. We have heart problems. We will probably die in the streets.\u201d\n\u201cSo the conservatives don\u2019t take any action,\u201d Mr. Du said, \u201cbecause they are afraid of that responsibility.\u201d\nOthers suggest the party can afford to be tolerant. Russell Leigh Moses, a Beijing-based analyst of China politics, said that Mr. Du and other liberal-minded party \u201celders\u201d posed no particular threat to today\u2019s Communist Party, so slaps on the wrists sufficed.\n\u201cI admire the courage and the conviction, but the conservatives really won this battle some time ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI really see him as a tragic figure, still holding the flag after most of the armies have left the field.\n\u201cHe is fighting a struggle against the political tenor of the times, as well as against time itself,\u201d Mr. Moses said.\nMr. Du is not, however, fighting with himself. He sees his modest magazine, printed on newsprint-quality paper and distributed to some 100,000 subscribers for about a dollar a copy, as \u201cthe best thing he has done in his life,\u201d his daughter said.\nThe struggle between truth and propaganda has been a constant theme in Mr. Du\u2019s life. He was an early Communist Party loyalist, dropping out of middle school at age 14 to join the battle against Japanese invaders. After the Communists rose to power in 1949, he dutifully \u2014 and falsely \u2014 reported the party\u2019s claims of record harvests and free food as a reporter for Xinhua, the state-run news agency.\nBut by April 1959, he could no longer reconcile the discrepancy with reality. In a 4,900-word letter to a superior, he documented widespread famine and disease in the countryside.\nWithin two months, his letter was turned against him during the campaign against antiparty \u201crightists.\u201d He was publicly condemned 17 times \u2014 once before an auditorium filled with 6,000 people \u2014 and dismissed from his job and party post.\nHe escaped even worse punishment, as many did, by betraying others to his government tormentors. The four people he named \u201csuffered greatly,\u201d he said. One refused until his dying day to forgive him.\nMr. Du was persecuted anew during the Cultural Revolution. \u201cIt was as though I was sent to hell and back,\u201d he wrote in his magazine in January.\nOnce rehabilitated, he rose quickly in the ranks of the state-run media. He held a vice ministerial position during the 1989 pro-democracy protests.\nMr. Du tried to marshal support for Mr. Zhao\u2019s position that the crisis should be resolved peacefully. In a letter signed by some 30 other government officials, Mr. Du urged party leaders not to use force against the demonstrators, according to his daughter.\nWhen the troops opened fire on the night of June 3, he, his wife and some friends \u201ccried from our hearts\u201d in his living room, Mr. Du said.\n\u201cWe all shared one feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Communist Party is over.\u201d\nIT was three years before he could discuss the tragedy with Mr. Zhao, who was removed as party secretary and placed under house arrest. Mr. Du, who was also ousted, said he urged Mr. Zhao to record his version of events for history\u2019s sake.\nIn the ensuing years, Mr. Du said, he filled two notebooks with Mr. Zhao\u2019s words, then switched to a tape recorder. Four other former officials also pitched in. Mr. Du hid his copies of the tapes in his daughter\u2019s underwear drawer and later she transported the copies to Hong Kong. After Mr. Zhao, still under house arrest, died in 2005, Bao Pu, the son of Mr. Zhao\u2019s top aide, began transcribing and translating other copies of the recordings.\nEver the strategist, Mr. Du recommended that the memoir be published only after the 20th anniversary of the crackdown in June. But with the support of Mr. Zhao\u2019s family, in May Mr. Bao arranged publication of a Chinese version in Hong Kong and an English version, titled \u201cPrisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang.\u201d\nHong Kong bookshops have reportedly sold 100,000 copies. \u201cI have not seen such excitement about a book in years,\u201d said Lam Mingkei, owner of Causeway Bay Bookstore, a prominent bookseller in Hong Kong.\nMr. Du said he believed that the democratic ideals expressed in Mr. Zhao\u2019s book and in the pages of his beloved journal would eventually take hold, though not, he predicted, under the current leaders. \u201cIf the Communist Party refuses to take political reform, then there must be some other force that rises up to carry it out,\u201d he said.\nIn the meantime, he says, he will defend his journal\u2019s role as a liberal windsock.

Her words, spoken in the Uighur language, were instantly picked up by international news agencies and broadcast by the Japanese media.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry immediately fired back, condemning Japan for granting Ms. Kadeer, 62, a visa for her weeklong visit, much of which will be devoted to giving speeches on what she says is China\u2019s suppression of the country\u2019s Uighurs, who make up the largest ethnic group in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.\nTo China, she is a terrorist and the unseen hand behind rioting in Xinjiang last July between Uighurs and Han Chinese that killed 197 people \u2014 most of them Han \u2014 and injured 1,600.\n\u201cSome forces in Japan have planned for Kadeer to go to Japan to engage in separatist activities aimed at China,\u201d Ma Zhaoxu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said during a regularly scheduled news conference on Tuesday. \u201cThe Japanese side has ignored China\u2019s staunch objections and allowed Rebiya to enter, and China expresses its strong dissatisfaction.\u201d\nSince the unrest last summer, Ms. Kadeer has become the internationally recognized face of the Uighur people, a Muslim, Turkic-speaking minority who have long had a contentious relationship with China\u2019s Han majority. Wherever she goes \u2014 from Germany to New Zealand \u2014 she handily draws attention.\nA year ago, however, Ms. Kadeer was hardly noticed and her cause \u2014 greater autonomy for China\u2019s Uighurs \u2014 largely unknown beyond a small, lonely band of rights advocates. \u201cUntil this year, I think a lot of Chinese would have had trouble identifying Rebiya Kadeer,\u201d said Michael Davis, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies China\u2019s relationship with its national minorities.\nMs. Kadeer has China to thank for her notoriety, which seems to increase each time she leaves Washington, her home since being freed from a Chinese prison in 2005 on the condition she go into exile.\nIn August, Chinese officials unleashed a fierce publicity campaign against her after the Melbourne International Film Festival invited her to attend a screening of a documentary about her life. Diplomats and Chinese citizens tried, and failed, to persuade festival organizers to rescind their invitation and pull the film. Last week, she barnstormed New Zealand for a few days and then flew to Germany, where she spoke at the Frankfurt Book Fair, infuriating China, which was the guest of honor.\n\u201cIt is just not right to welcome a country where executions are a daily occurrence and human rights are treated with disrespect,\u201d she said in a speech there.\nFor the most part, China\u2019s efforts to convince the world that she is a terrorist have failed. To bolster its contentions, the government released transcripts of a phone conversation in which she warned her brother to stay off the streets of Urumqi, the regional capital, on the day of an illegal rally by Uighur students. The demonstration, aimed at drawing attention to the death of two Uighurs 10 days earlier, gave way to the worst rioting in years.\nMs. Kadeer, who leads the World Uighur Congress, has denied any hand in the unrest, saying Chinese security forces provoked the murderous rampage by Uighur mobs and the retaliatory violence by Han in the days that followed.\nSo far, Chinese courts have handed down 12 death sentences to those convicted of taking part in the riots. She says that others have been quietly executed without trial.\nChina\u2019s eight million Uighurs have long yearned for a standard-bearer like the Dalai Lama, whose beatific mien is associated with the aspirations of the Tibetan people. Although she does not have his stature, his fluency in English or his aura of holiness, Ms. Kadeer, a wealthy businesswoman before her imprisonment, has mastered public relations and the well-honed sound bite.\n\u201cThe Chinese government took a grandmother with 11 children and gave her an international image,\u201d said J. Bruce Jacobs, who teaches Asian Studies at Monash University in Australia. \u201cI think their plan totally backfired.\u201d\nHere in China, few question the official description of Ms. Kadeer as a terrorist and find the positive attention she garners abroad confounding and hurtful. Su Hao, director of the Center for Strategic and Conflict Management at China Foreign Affairs University, blamed the foreign media, which he said had purposely played down evidence of Ms. Kadeer\u2019s role in organizing the riots. \u201cThe West uses figures like Rebiya Kadeer to hold China back,\u201d he said.\nDong Guanpeng, director of the Global Journalism Institute at Tsinghua University in Beijing, teaches Chinese officials how to grapple with local crises and says that China has to do a better job getting its message out to foreign audiences. \u201cWe\u2019ve already proven domestically that she is the enemy of the Chinese people,\u201d he said from Chongqing, where he was conducting a training session for local officials. \u201cWe just have to find a way to make the truth more acceptable to everyone else,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/world/asia/21china.html", "title": "Leader of China\u2019s Uighur Minority Builds a Stage Across the Globe", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}

While some Democrats said they would support whatever he decided, others challenged him about sending more troops. And Republicans pressed him to order the escalation without delay, leading to a pointed exchange between the president and Senator John McCain of Arizona, his Republican opponent from last year\u2019s election.\nMr. McCain told the president that \u201ctime is not on our side.\u201d He added, \u201cThis should not be a leisurely process,\u201d according to several people in the room.\nA few minutes later, Mr. Obama replied, \u201cJohn, I can assure you this won\u2019t be leisurely,\u201d according to several attendees. \u201cNo one feels more urgency to get this right than I do.\u201d\nStill, compared with the harsh debate over health care, the tone was civil and restrained during the 75-minute meeting in the State Dining Room as Mr. Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and about 30 members of Congress gathered around a large table with only glasses of water and notebooks in front of them.\nMr. Obama summoned the lawmakers to assure them that he would keep their concerns in mind as he considered the request of his commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, for as many as 40,000 more troops. The president plans to meet with his national security team on Wednesday to talk about Pakistan and on Friday to talk about Afghanistan. Aides plan to schedule one more meeting before he decides on General McChrystal\u2019s proposal.\nSeveral administration officials and lawmakers who attended the session on Tuesday said Mr. Obama was intent on using it to dismiss any impression that he would consider pulling out of Afghanistan. \u201cThere is no option that would entail a dramatic reduction in troops,\u201d said one administration official, who, like others quoted in this article, requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting.\nMr. Obama and Mr. Biden made it clear that the option Mr. Biden had proposed was not a pure counterterrorism alternative, relying only on drones and Special Forces to track down leaders of Al Qaeda. Instead, Mr. Biden\u2019s approach would increase the use of such surgical strikes while leaving the overall size of the American force in Afghanistan roughly at the 68,000 troops currently authorized.\nAnd in the final moments of the meeting, Mr. Obama sought to put to rest suspicions of friction with General McChrystal. \u201cI\u2019m the one who hired him,\u201d Mr. Obama said, according to participants. \u201cI put him there to give me a frank assessment.\u201d\nA joint appearance afterward on the White House driveway by the two top Democratic Congressional leaders demonstrated Mr. Obama\u2019s political challenge. \u201cThe one thing that I thought was interesting was that everyone, Democrats and Republicans, said whatever decision you make, we\u2019ll support it basically,\u201d said Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader.\nBut Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, smiled and raised her eyebrows in apparent disagreement. \u201cWhether we agreed with it or voted for it remains to be seen when we see what the president puts forth,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think there was a real display of universal respect for the manner in which he was approaching it.\u201d\nAt least three Democrats \u2014 Ms. Pelosi; Senator Carl Levin, the Armed Services Committee chairman; and Representative David R. Obey, the Appropriations Committee chairman \u2014 voiced reservations during the meeting about increasing troops, according to those in attendance.\n\u201cThere were a number of people who spoke out with a lot of caution about getting in deeper and what the endpoint is,\u201d Mr. Levin said in an interview. Mr. Levin, who promoted accelerated training of Afghan forces, then met alone with Mr. Obama to expand on his views.\nOthers shared their skepticism in interviews. \u201cClearly, there is hesitancy about the prospect of sending 40,000 more troops,\u201d said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York.\nSenator John Kerry, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said after the meeting that \u201cit would be irresponsible\u201d to send more troops until it became clear \u201cwhat is possible in Afghanistan.\u201d\nSome Democrats were more supportive of General McChrystal\u2019s request, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, head of the intelligence committee, and Representative Ike Skelton, head of the Armed Services Committee.\n\u201cI said the real war in Afghanistan did not start until March, when the president made the speech on strategy,\u201d Mr. Skelton said in an interview, referring to the strategy Mr. Obama put in place shortly after taking office. \u201cThere was no strategy before that,\u201d he said, and so the president ought to give General McChrystal what he needs to execute it.\nRepublicans pressed even harder. After the meeting, Mr. McCain warned against any middle ground. \u201cHalf measures is what I worry about,\u201d he said. Citing the Bush administration\u2019s experience in Iraq, he added that half measures \u201clead to failure over time and an erosion of American public support.\u201d\nMr. Obama separately pointed to American successes against Al Qaeda in a series of recent missile strikes and Special Forces raids. During a visit to the National Counterterrorism Center just outside Washington on Tuesday, he said Al Qaeda had \u201clost operational capacity\u201d but he vowed to continue pressing the battle to cripple the network around the world.\nWhite House officials said the president\u2019s visit was not related to the Afghanistan review. But the public focus on efforts to eliminate Al Qaeda\u2019s top hierarchy through surgical strikes could provide political cover for Mr. Obama should he reject the most expansive request for 40,000 more troops.\nGen. David H. Petraeus, who oversees operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, told a military conference on Tuesday that the president\u2019s strategy review was progressing toward a decision. \u201cIt is moving quite rapidly,\u201d he told the Association of the United States Army. \u201cThere is a recognition of the need to move through this.\u201d\nThe general said the effort in Afghanistan required \u201ca sustained, substantial commitment,\u201d but he declined to say if that meant more troops.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/world/asia/07prexy.html", "title": "Obama Rules Out Large Reduction in Afghan Force", "author": "PETER BAKER and JEFF ZELENY"}
{"date": "Fri, 31 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PARIS \u2014 Airbus is advising airlines to replace, as a precaution, the type of air speed sensor that malfunctioned on an Air France plane that crash last month, the company confirmed Friday.\nAirbus said it had sent the recommendation late Thursday to all operators of Airbus A330 and A340 wide-body planes in anticipation of a European safety order. A spokesman for the European Air Safety Agency has said it would propose within the next two weeks a ban on an older model of the component, known as a Pitot tube, made by the French manufacturer Thales. Airlines using a more recent model of the Thales tube are also being urged to replace at least two of three probes on each plane with a model built by Goodrich, an American competitor, Airbus and the safety agency said.\nThe recommendation comes nearly two months after Air France Flight 447 crashed amid a violent thunderstorm in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on June 1, killing all 228 passengers and crew members aboard. It also follows a series of differing recommendations by Airbus over the past two years on the use of airspeed sensors made by Thales in certain weather conditions and at high altitude.\nThe French authorities leading the investigation into the crash have not yet determined the cause, but they have said they suspect a speed sensor malfunction may have been a contributing factor.\nDaniel Hoeltgen, a spokesman for the European safety agency, stressed that the recommendation was a precautionary measure only, since the crash investigation has not implicated the Pitot tubes as the cause of the crash.\n\u201cWe are doing this as a part of an ongoing analysis, information we have received about similar incidents and technical evaluations that have been undertaken over the past month,\u201d Mr. Hoeltgen said. \u201cWe think that this is a positive measure to take.\u201d\nAll Airbus planes are equipped with three pairs of Pitot tubes, and airspeed is calculated using readings from all three sensors. The sensors can be crucial to the pilots\u2019 ability to control an aircraft: A plane that flies too slowly can lose lift and crash, while one that is moving too fast can break up in the air.\nAirbus had recommended nearly two years ago that airlines replace the older Thales-made tubes, a model known as AA, on its smaller A320 aircraft because tests had shown that a newer model, the BA, performed better in rainy conditions at lower altitudes. Regulators never mandated the change because it was not considered a safety issue.\nBut in November 2008, after Air France had reported to Airbus a series of incidents involving Pitot tube malfunctions because of high-altitude icing on its A340s between May and August of that year, Airbus amended its original recommendation of September 2007, saying that the newer Thales model had not been designed to resist icing and could therefore not provide a significant improvement.\nIn April of this year, after Air France reported two new Pitot tube malfunctions, including the first such incident on an A330, the airline appealed to Airbus for a solution, according to an internal Air France memo to pilots dated June 17, 2009. In the memo, a copy of which was obtained by the International Herald Tribune, Air France said it had been informed by Airbus that testing of the newer Thales tubes \u201crevealed a significant improvement in its performance compared with the previous model.\u201d Airbus proposed a trial on Air France planes to confirm the improvement in real-life conditions.\nAir France, according to the memo, elected to forego the trials and decided instead to replace the older Thales sensors with the newer model across its fleet, a program that began in late April.\nAir France declined to comment Friday on its past discussions with Airbus, but said that it would follow the manufacturer\u2019s latest recommendation regarding the Goodrich sensors.\nStefan Schaffrath, an Airbus spokesman, said that Thales had been asked to make improvements to its speed sensors as soon as possible, though he stressed that all Pitot tubes made by Thales continued to meet regulators\u2019 airworthiness certification standards.\nPress officers for Thales were not immediately available for comment.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/world/europe/01crash.html", "title": "Airbus Advises Airlines to Replace Speed Sensors", "author": "NICOLA CLARK"}

{"date": "Wed, 18 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 Chinese officials have significantly increased security forces across Tibet in the face of a grass-roots movement to boycott festivities during the coming Tibetan New Year, according to residents of the region and recent visitors. The movement aims to use the holiday period to mourn Tibetans who were killed during the government crackdown last March and express concern for those arrested or tortured.\nThe increased forces have been seen in at least four crucial areas of the vast Tibetan region: Lhasa, the capital; Xiahe, a town in Gansu Province that is home to a large and restive monastery; Tongren, a monastery town in Qinghai Province; and Lithang, a town in Sichuan Province that has been locked down this week.\nThe problems in Lithang stemmed from a single person\u2019s protest on Sunday, according to residents and the Free Tibet Campaign, an advocacy group in London. A monk, Lobsang Lhundup, 37, shouted slogans from a street corner supporting the Dalai Lama and calling for a New Year\u2019s boycott, the group said. The next day, hundreds of Tibetans took to the streets to demand the monk\u2019s release; riot police officers broke up the protest and arrested about 20 people.\nOn Tuesday, the government ordered shops and hotels to shut down for three days, several residents said by telephone. A young woman, who asked not to be named for her safety, said, \u201cShops have all closed, and people do not dare to go out.\u201d\nLocal security officers declined to comment when asked about the episode over the telephone.\nThe campaign for the boycott of Losar, the Tibetan New Year, has spread via text and e-mail messages and fliers. The holiday begins next Wednesday.\nLast March, Tibetans angry over China\u2019s policies in Tibet and the suppression of peaceful protests rioted in Lhasa, leading to widespread damage and the deaths of at least 18 civilians and one police officer, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Protests flared up in other regions, and exile groups said hundreds of Tibetans were killed in the ensuing crackdown.\nThe call for a boycott began several months ago and has gained traction among younger Tibetans as well as intellectuals and dissidents. It has been endorsed by overseas Tibetans, including the government in exile in Dharamsala, India.\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply connected with Tibetan culture, the idea that after such a horrible year filled with death, how can we celebrate?\u201d Woeser, a popular Tibetan blogger, said in an interview. \u201cInstead, it should be a memorial.\u201d\nThe Chinese government is also fearful of unrest in the region next month, on the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama\u2019s flight to exile in India after a failed rebellion against Chinese control, a date of great moment to Tibetans. The Dalai Lama, revered by many Tibetans, advocates greater autonomy for Tibet. But the Chinese government vilifies him as a \u201csplittist,\u201d and says he ruled over a feudal slave-holding society. In a move that antagonized many Tibetans this winter, the government declared March 28 to be Serf Emancipation Day.\nThe issue of Tibet is already emerging as a delicate one between the Obama administration and Beijing. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is scheduled to visit China this week, said in a speech before the trip that Beijing should ensure religious freedom for Tibetans.\nForeign reporters are not allowed to visit Lhasa and central Tibet unless invited by the Chinese government.\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said last week that \u201cthe situation in Tibet is stable.\u201d But a monk from Lhasa, reached by phone, said, \u201cThere are a lot of soldiers and People\u2019s Armed Police in the streets,\u201d referring to China\u2019s main paramilitary force. Like almost all the people interviewed for this article, the monk agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisals.\nThe monk said he, like thousands of other monks, had not been allowed to return to his monastery after being imprisoned for several months last year after the March uprising. Many of the main monasteries are being emptied out, he said. There are only about 400 monks now in the Drepung Monastery in Lhasa, he said, a small fraction of the number before the uprising.\nThe monks are still being forced to take \u201cpatriotic education\u201d classes that have been going on in many monasteries since the March protests, he added. As a result, the monks study Chinese law rather than Buddhist scriptures and are told to denounce the Dalai Lama.\nMonks no longer in the monasteries are barred from wearing their robes in public, the monk said, and the police check on the monks at home, at times hauling some off to prison. The monk said Tibetan policemen came to his home three times a month.\n\u201cThey ask, \u2018Where have you been?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201c \u2018Have you been out? What are Tibetans talking about in the society? Have you met with friends who are in prison?\u2019 \u201d\nThe monk said many Tibetans in Lhasa were talking of joining the boycott. But he said that Chinese officials were urging the Tibetans to carry on with festivities and were even offering them money to do so.\nFarther east, in Gansu Province, the authorities have declared the town of Xiahe, the site of the Labrang Monastery, off limits to foreigners. Labrang is considered one of the greatest centers of learning in the Tibetan world, and it was a locus of protests last year.\nA local tourism official said the area around Labrang was closed to foreigners until late March. Two French television journalists who secretly stayed in the town two nights in early February said they had to sneak past two checkpoints. They said they saw soldiers, police officers and paramilitary troops everywhere.\n\u201cThere was an open plaza, and it was full of People\u2019s Armed Police with black uniforms, helmets and shields,\u201d said one, Charlotte Cailliez. \u201cOn the main street, there were police cars going back and forth.\u201d\nTo the west, in the town of Tongren, known to Tibetans as Rebkong, police and paramilitary forces were scarce during the day but came out in force at night, said a local Tibetan man.\nThere, the call for a boycott on festivities not only pertains to Losar, but also included the recent Chinese New Year, which many Tibetans in Rebkong celebrated in past years. Normally, the town would convulse in singing, dancing and pyrotechnics during the two-week holiday. But this year, few Tibetans participated.\nLocal officials handed out hundreds of dollars to people to buy fireworks, the man said.\nBut the Tibetans practiced restraint. In the main temple compound, he said, worshipers lighted yak butter lamps, and \u201cthe mood was very, very quiet and solemn.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/world/asia/19tibet.html", "title": "China Adds to Security Forces in Tibet Amid Calls for a Boycott", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

Butterfly,\u201d died in Paris on Tuesday.\nHis death was announced to Agence France-Presse by an aide.\nMr. Shi (pronounced Shuh), who was convicted of espionage in France in 1986 along with his lover, Bernard Boursicot, was believed to be 70. He had also been believed for years to be a woman, at least by Mr. Boursicot, who served time in prison after the affair and became a laughingstock in France.\nMr. Boursicot, who is 64 and has been living in a nursing home in France while recovering from a stroke, showed no sadness when he learned of Mr. Shi\u2019s death in a telephone interview.\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d he said, in a tone that suggested weariness with a former lover\u2019s theatrics. \u201cIt is a long time he has been sick. Now it\u2019s over 40 years.\u201d\nAsked if he had any sadness at all, Mr. Boursicot said: \u201cHe did so many things against me that he had no pity for, I think it is stupid to play another game now and say I am sad. The plate is clean now. I am free.\u201d\nIn the 1988 Broadway play and the 1993 film \u201cM. Butterfly,\u201d Bernard Boursicot was depicted as a high-ranking diplomat and Shi Pei Pu as a beautiful female opera singer who met in 1964. In fact, Mr. Boursicot was a 20-year-old high school dropout who had finagled a job as an accountant at the newly opened French Embassy in Beijing. His few sexual experiences had been with male schoolmates, and he was determined to fall in love with a woman, he wrote in his diary.\nShi Pei Pu was 26 when they met, delicate and charming. He lived as a man and taught Chinese to the diplomatic wives. He told Mr. Boursicot that he had been a singer and a librettist in the Beijing Opera. One perfect night in the Forbidden City Mr. Shi told Mr. Boursicot a story no romantic could resist: Mr. Shi said he was a woman who had been forced to go through life as a man, because her father required a son. A short time later, the men became lovers, although the sex, Mr. Boursicot would later say, was fast and furtive, always carried out in the dark.\nWhen the affair was discovered by the Chinese authorities, Mr. Boursicot passed them French documents, first from the embassy in Beijing and later from his posting at the consulate in Ulan Bator, Mongolia.\nMr. Boursicot spent most of his life outside China and was romantically involved with men and women. On his rare visits to Shi Pei Pu, sexual contact was circumscribed. On one visit, Mr. Shi presented him with a 4-year-old boy, Shi Du Du, who Mr. Shi said was their son.\nIn 1982, Mr. Boursicot \u2014 then living openly with a male companion, Thierry Toulet \u2014 was able to arrange for Shi Pei Pu and Shi Du Du to live with him in Paris. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Boursicot and Shi Pei Pu were arrested. Mr. Shi first told the police he was a woman, but he admitted the truth to prison doctors, showing them how he hid his genitals.\nShi Du Du explained the mystery of where he came from in his statement to the police: he was from China\u2019s Uighur minority, he said, and had been sold by his mother. \u201cIt was not that my mother did not love me,\u201d he said. \u201dWe were starving.\u201d\nMr. Boursicot, hearing that Shi Pei Pu was a man and always had been, sliced his throat with a razor blade in prison.\nIn 1986, Mr. Shi and Mr. Boursicot received six-year sentences for espionage. They were pardoned a year later. Mr. Shi is survived by Shi Du Du, who lives in Paris and who, Mr. Boursicot said, has three young sons.\nAlthough Mr. Boursicot and Mr. Shi occasionally spoke over the years, relations were strained. Mr. Boursicot said that they last spoke a few months ago and that Mr. Shi told him he still loved him.\nMr. Shi enjoyed the spotlight, performing in public as an opera singer, but disliked talking about his romance with Mr. Boursicot, particularly the sexual specifics.\n\u201cI used to fascinate both men and women,\u201d he said in a rare interview in 1988. \u201cWhat I was and what they were didn\u2019t matter.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/world/asia/02shi.html", "title": "Shi Pei Pu, Singer, Spy and \u2018M.

{"date": "Thu, 07 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SUKHUMI, Georgia \u2014 As night gathers over the Black Sea waterfront, a dozen pilgrims meet in the second-floor classroom where they are studying Abkhaz, the language of their new home.\nThe neighborhood has a decrepit, post-Soviet feel and is still pockmarked with bullet holes from Abkhazia\u2019s war to separate from Georgia. At moments of weakness, when the task of learning Russian and Abkhaz is making her head swim, Selin Katsba longs for Istanbul, where she grew up.\nThen she remembers herself. In Turkey, many ethnic Abkhaz she knows are toying with the idea of returning to the land their great-grandparents fled \u2014 especially now that it is under the protection of Russia. If she wavers, they will waver.\n\u201cIn the eyes of my peers and my family, I am like a symbol and a leader because I have returned,\u201d said Ms. Katsba, 22, who arrived here for a 15-day visit more than two years ago and never left. \u201cIt\u2019s important that I stay.\u201d\nNow that Russia has recognized the territory as a sovereign nation, authorities hope ethnic Abkhaz will return from the places they fled to in the 19th century, in part to escape the expanding Russian empire. They hope that some percentage of the estimated half-million Abkhaz in Turkey will replenish Abkhazia\u2019s Abkhaz, whose numbers have slipped below 100,000, and that entrepreneurs from the diaspora will provide new investment.\nSo far, the returnees are trailing in one by one, and no one expects a sudden influx. But if Abkhaz repatriation picks up speed, it could have a long-term effect, shoring up ties with Turkey, reaffirming its split from Georgia and lessening its reliance on Russia. Officials here say plans are afoot to build a mosque in the capital, a project that has been discussed for generations, and one that would signal a welcome to settlers.\nAs they try to visualize Abkhazia\u2019s future, one concept that makes sense, they say, is that of a Caucasian homeland.\n\u201cCan anyone condemn Jews for calling on all the Jews of the world and inviting them to Israel?\u201d said Abkhazia\u2019s president, Sergei Bagapsh, in an interview last week. \u201cWe may not be able to match Israel. But that is what we aspire to.\u201d\nNine months after celebrating independence from Georgia, Abkhazia stands with its ravishing, unspoiled coastline and a sprawling, if run-down, tourism infrastructure. What it lacks is people. When war broke out with Georgia, in 1992 and 1993, about 200,000 Georgians fled their homes, cutting the population almost in half. The most recent census, in 2003, found a population of 215,000, and much of the territory still has the eerie feeling of an abandoned resort.\nAbkhaz have been trying to increase their numbers through repatriation since the 1990s, and officials say only around 2,000 have returned. Many of those who returned soon after the war spoke neither Russian nor Abkhaz, and found their homeland plagued by shortages, travel bans, poverty and isolation. It was also Russified and predominately Orthodox.\nGennady Matveyev, a Russian whose grandparents settled in Sukhumi, said the early resettlers never quite fit in.\n\u201cThey came in their slippers, they came from the village,\u201d said Mr. Matveyev, 42. \u201cThey sat and sat. They didn\u2019t like to work.\u201d\nBut Russian recognition has breathed life into the project, and Mr. Matveyev said that more recent arrivals were young and educated, \u201ca higher level of people.\u201d As an incentive, the state now offers repatriates citizenship, a year\u2019s free housing and five years of financial aid.\nAmong the twentysomethings at the Young Abkhazia Youth Patriotic Movement, the subject arouses passionate enthusiasm. Last year, 45 members toured Turkish cities, meeting with young people from the diaspora in hopes of strengthening ties.\nTheir counterparts peppered them with questions: Will there be another war? Is it scary to live there? But the most common question was whether Abkhazia was having \u201ctoo much contact with Russia,\u201d said Alias V. Avidzba, the group\u2019s president.\n\u201cThat is the image from outside, but we explained that it is not true,\u201d he said.\nCemre Jade, a 29-year-old Turkish-born sociologist working for Abkhazia\u2019s Center for Strategic Studies, a government-financed policy research organization, hopes that Abkhazia can model its repatriation program on Israel\u2019s, which offers resettlers a full package of support systems and benefits. In her own outreach, she describes Abkhazia as an economy on the cusp of huge growth, which may be too prosperous to afford in a few years.\nBut for members of the diaspora in Turkey, she said, the central pull is the idea of coming home. Recently, when someone created a Facebook page called \u201cI\u2019m Going to Return to Abkhazia Someday,\u201d 600 people had joined by the second day, she said.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s not wrong to say you are from another country,\u201d said Ms. Jade, whose ancestors are Adyghe, a Caucasian people related to the Abkhaz. \u201cYou can say, \u2018This is my country in the Caucasus, and I\u2019m going to be there someday. I\u2019m going to return to Abkhazia someday.\u2019 \u201d\nThe same idea occurred to Amin Bakig, who was visiting Sukhumi from Jordan last week. Mr. Bakig runs an Amman-based travel business that caters to diaspora Circassians, a people related to the Abkhaz, who are scattered through Turkey, Jordan and Syria. As soon as Russia recognized Abkhazia as a sovereign nation, he knew it would be his next big tourist destination.\nA week in Sukhumi \u2014 now known by its Abkhaz name, Sukhum \u2014 had only stoked his enthusiasm, and he will return in August with his first group of 100 tourists. Three days into the visit, he was granted an Abkhaz passport and a plot of land near the seashore. By the end of the week, he had begun to think about recruiting investors for a major tourist concern.\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t like to be in this country?\u201d Mr. Bakig said. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t like to be given free land? Who knows what they will give them later?\nMr. Bakig has long ago adjusted to the notion that the Caucasian homeland is under Russian control. He speaks of Russians with great warmth, and was inspired by Russia\u2019s defense of Abkhaz independence last year. His face takes on a more abstract expression, however, when he talks about the descendants of the Caucasians who left the region four generations ago and now number five million or more.\n\u201cThere is a big dream,\u201d he said, \u201cthat one day they will give independence to the southern Caucasus. This is our dream. But we cooperate with Russia.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/world/europe/08abkhazia.html", "title": "Abkhazia Lures Its Expatriates, Welcoming Them One by One", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}

They also announced that Hakimullah Mehsud would take over leadership of the Pakistani Taliban, while Mr. Rahman would lead the Taliban in South Waziristan, the rugged tribal region that had been Baitullah Mehsud\u2019s stronghold.\nBut Pakistani officials immediately cast doubt on the claims and about whether Hakimullah Mehsud was alive or dead. The Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik, contends that Hakimullah Mehsud is dead. Analysts said the public admission of Baitullah Mehsud\u2019s death came after it became increasingly difficult for the Taliban to continue denying it.\nRahimullah Yousafzai, an analyst and journalist based in Peshawar, speaking to the Geo television network, said the Taliban initially thought they could hide Mr. Mehsud\u2019s killing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t possible for them to hide it and eventually they have admitted now,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, in the northern Swat Valley, villagers and district officials have found dozens of bodies of suspected militants in the past two weeks. Three bodies were found in the Danagram area on the outskirts of Swat\u2019s central town of Mingora on Tuesday morning, the BBC reported.\nMost of the dead had multiple gunshot wounds and were found dumped in fields and alleys while blindfolded with their hands tied behind their backs.\nLast week the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent rights group, put out a statement rebutting the military\u2019s denial of involvement.\n\u201cThe commission reiterates that it has come across credible accounts of extrajudicial killings and complaints of reprisal attacks by the security forces during the operation in Swat,\u201d Asma Jahangir, the chairwoman of the commission, said in the statement.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/26/world/asia/26pstan.html", "title": "Taliban in Pakistan Confirm That Their Leader Is Dead", "author": "SALMAN MASOOD"}
{"date": "Thu, 03 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Obama administration officials tried again on Thursday to reassure members of Congress anxious about the military buildup in Afghanistan, telling them repeatedly that American troops can begin to withdraw in July 2011. But the lawmakers seemed more interested in how long the withdrawal would take.\nDefense Secretary Robert M. Gates said July 2011 \u201cwill be the beginning of a process, an inflection point, if you will, of transition for Afghan forces as they begin to assume greater responsibility for security.\u201d He went on to say that the pace of the withdrawal would be determined by \u201cconditions on the ground.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be a gradual but inexorable process,\u201d Mr. Gates told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in remarks on President Obama\u2019s plan to ship about 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan next year, bringing the total American troops there to about 100,000.\nSeveral members of the Foreign Relations Committee clearly wanted far more specifics than Mr. Gates offered in his nuanced remarks. Indeed, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, was skeptical even about the July 2011 target date for beginning to bring home the troops, calling it \u201cclearly aspirational.\u201d\n\u201cCan any of you tell me, after July 2011, that we won\u2019t have tens of thousands of troops years after that date?\u201d Mr. Menendez asked Mr. Gates, as well as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who were also testifying.\nMrs. Clinton said the \u201cbest information available at the moment\u201d pointed to July 2011 as the pivotal moment. But she said that the withdrawal of troops would go on \u201cprobably for the foreseeable future,\u201d as would requests for \u201ccontinuing logistical support for the Afghan security force.\u201d\nMoreover, Mrs. Clinton said, despite the \u201climited\u201d duration of the American military presence in Afghanistan, \u201cour civilian commitment must continue, even as our troops begin coming home.\u201d\n\u201cWe will be asking the young men and women, who not only serve in the military but are part of our civilian service team, to be taking great risks and facing extraordinary sacrifices,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cwe will do everything we can to ensure that their sacrifices make our nation safer.\u201d\nAs they have before, Mrs. Clinton and the Pentagon officials asserted, sometimes in the face of skeptics, that problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan must be dealt with together, and that terrorists from Al Qaeda and the Taliban insurgents are part of the same threat, even if they do not always coordinate their efforts.\nThe officials asserted, too, that the plans to withdraw American troops were definite enough, with the July 2011 starting date, to pressure the Afghan government to assume its responsibilities, yet flexible enough to meet the needs of the American military.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not arbitrary at all,\u201d Admiral Mullen said, calling 2011 the right time to begin the transition to full Afghan control \u201cresponsibly and based on conditions.\u201d\nSome members of Congress, notably Senator John McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, have argued that it is unwise to set even an initial withdrawal date because doing so encourages an enemy. But Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the foreign relations panel, disagreed. Setting a target date \u201cwill help create a sense of urgency\u201d among Afghans, Mr. Kerry said.\n\u201cAnd for the Afghans who chafe at foreign boots on their soil, it sends a message that while America will remain committed to the Afghan people, we aren\u2019t interested in a permanent occupation,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.\nSenator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, wanted to know just what \u201cconditions on the ground\u201d would indicate that the withdrawal process could begin.\nMrs. Clinton said, \u201cI think you raised a very profoundly important question.\u201d Part of the answer, she said, is \u201cdecentralization of government\u2019s function and authority\u201d to reflect the way the mountainous, mostly rural country actually operates.\nThe Obama administration has tried to distinguish its efforts in Afghanistan from what it has characterized as the Bush administration\u2019s overly ambitious goals to build a democratic government in Iraq. Mr. Kerry said he was pleased that the approach to Afghanistan that Mr. Obama laid out did not amount to \u201can open-ended nation-building exercise or a nationwide counterinsurgency campaign.\u201d\nBut the difference between engaging in \u201cnation-building\u201d and propping up a fledgling Afghan government may not always be easy to discern. For instance, Mrs. Clinton said that America\u2019s commitment to Afghanistan was reflected not only by the presence of American troops but also by the significant commitment of American civilians in the country.\n\u201cCivilian experts and advisers are helping to craft policy inside government ministries,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, adding that financial aid for those ministries would not be released until American overseers had confidence in them.\nAt another point, Admiral Mullen noted that the development of a reliable Afghan Army had been slow because \u201cthe Taliban make a lot more money than the national security forces right now.\u201d (The opium trade is a primary source of income for the Taliban.)\nBut, Admiral Mullen said, the American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, is seeing to it that that the Afghan forces\u2019 pay is being increased significantly, \u201cwhich we think will have an impact.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/asia/04policy.html", "title": "Gates Says Afghan Drawdown Timing Is Flexible", "author": "DAVID STOUT"}

Only hours after his acquittal, he appeared before another judge to defend himself against charges that he was involved in the massacre of Kurds in 1983.\nEven so, the verdict was viewed as a sign of judicial fairness and independence for a tribunal that has been deliberating the most heinous crimes of Mr. Hussein\u2019s era.\nThe court on Monday convicted Ali Hassan al-Majid, a former Hussein aide known as \u201cChemical Ali\u201d for ordering poison gas attacks against the Kurds in the 1980s, for his role in the killings for which Mr. Aziz was acquitted. For a third time, he was sentenced to death.\nTwo other Hussein aides, Saif al-Din al-Mashhadani and Uglah Abid Siqir al-Kubaysi, both senior Baath party officials who appeared on the well-known deck of playing cards depicting Iraq\u2019s most wanted, were also acquitted in the case.\nThe court, officially the Iraqi High Tribunal, was created after the 2003 invasion during the period of the American provisional government to prosecute cases against Mr. Hussein and his senior aides. It has dismissed charges and delivered acquittals in a handful of other cases, but none involving a defendant as prominent as Mr. Aziz, who served as Iraq\u2019s foreign minister during the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and as Mr. Hussein\u2019s deputy prime minister during the American invasion in 2003.\nReaction to the verdict was mixed.\n\u201cAccording to the Constitution, the judiciary is independent; no one has a right to interfere with the decisions that come from the court,\u201d Abbas al-Baiaty, a member of Parliament allied with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\u2019s Dawa Party, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe respect these decisions from this court because it is objective.\u201d\nBy contrast, a member of the movement now led by the grand ayatollah\u2019s son, Moktada, denounced the verdict. The member, Liqa Jaffar al-Yassin, who is also a member of Parliament, said, \u201cThis decision devalues the blood of Sadrists.\u201d\nMr. Aziz turned himself in to American forces in April 2003. He appeared in court looking frail and aged, dressed in a black suit.\nWhen the judge finished reading the verdict, Mr. Aziz showed little emotion, but raised his hand and said simply, \u201cThank you.\u201d In his second courtroom appearance of the day, however, he disputed that he had had a role in the massacre of Kurds, saying he had been defending Kurdish rights, and criticized the court in general.\n\u201cHere is another false allegation,\u201d Mr. Aziz said, and then referred to his earlier verdict. \u201cAfter 61 sessions they found the allegations were false and acquitted me.\u201d\nHis lawyer, Badea Araf Azzit, said the court was illegal and complained that it had dragged out trials like Mr. Aziz\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they kept him for five years and just today they acquitted him,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/world/middleeast/03iraq.html", "title": "Iraqi Court Acquits Hussein Aide in 1999 Crackdown on Shiite Protest", "author": "STEVEN LEE MYERS"}

Hundreds attended the funeral.\nMr. Ivankov died on Friday in a Moscow hospital from complications stemming from a gunshot wound he received apparently in an assassination attempt in July. He was 69.\nHis death has set off fears of a mob war in Moscow like those that bloodied the streets of major Russian cities in the 1990s.\n\u201cIt almost certainly will lead to some deaths,\u201d said Vadim Volkov, a Russian mafia expert at the European University at St. Petersburg. \u201cIt shows that violence is still the ultimate way of resolving a dispute.\u201d\nRussian officials, however, have played down the threat.\n\u201cThere will be no conflict,\u201d Vladimir A. Vasilyev, chairman of the Security Committee in the Russian Parliament, told the Ria Novosti news agency. \u201cEven if there is one, then it will occur so deeply within these structures that it will in no way threaten citizens.\u201d\nBetter known as Yaponchik, or the Little Japanese, Mr. Ivankov was among the last of a mafia-like criminal class known as the Vory v Zakone, or Thieves-in-Law. Though the Vory figure prominently in Russia\u2019s rich criminal mythology, their influence in the criminal world has waned since their heyday in the Soviet period, organized crime experts say.\nAmong these heavily tattooed crime barons, Mr. Ivankov was royalty. By most accounts he began his career as a petty thief in the 1960s, serving multiple terms in Soviet prisons before fleeing to the United States in the early 1990s. There, he built a criminal empire based in New York that the F.B.I. once considered among the most powerful in the country.\nIn 1997 he was sentenced to nine years in prison for extortion, but was extradited to Russia in 2004 to face murder charges. He was acquitted and freed.\nMr. Ivankov was able to keep a low profile until July, when a gunman shot him in the stomach with a sniper rifle as he left a Thai restaurant in central Moscow, Russian prosecutors said. No suspects have been identified.\nThe funeral brought out a sampling of characters, including thick-necked toughs wearing heavy gold chains and cigar-smoking men in pinstriped suits. Many were carrying huge bouquets of red roses.\n\u201cForgive us, we could not protect you,\u201d read a banner signed \u201cOsman and brothers\u201d on one of the many wreaths from various \u201cbrotherhoods\u201d piled outside the chapel of the Vagankovskoe Cemetery, where Mr. Ivankov was buried.\nSeveral ambulances and busloads of riot police officers crowded the cemetery entrance, though mourners appeared to come and go freely.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/world/europe/14mobster.html", "title": "For a Departed Mobster, Wreaths and Roses but No Tears", "author": "MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ"}

Some of Mr. Maliki\u2019s supporters have accused the Islamic Supreme Council of having plotted to oust him as well as having campaigned inappropriately during a recent Shiite religious holiday.\nSheik Jalaluddin al-Saghir, a member of Parliament and a leader of the Islamic Supreme Council party, called these accusations painful and insulting during a sermon at a Baghdad mosque on Friday.\nMr. Sadr\u2019s movement, seeking to capitalize on this rift among the major Shiite parties, urged followers on Friday to vote for two lists that it said were made up of independent candidates. The Sadr movement is not formally endorsing candidates.\n\u201cEveryone must vote in the elections to prevent a sinister plot to divide Iraq,\u201d said Sheik Salah al-Obeidi, Mr. Sadr\u2019s spokesman, during a sermon at a mosque in Kufa near the Shiite holy city of Najaf. Afterward, candidates handed out pamphlets.\nAfter prayers on the street in front of Mr. Sadr\u2019s main office in the Sadr City district of Baghdad, a group of young men swarmed around Ali Mohammed Muslim, who was running for a provincial council seat. He is a senior member of both the political and military wings of Mr. Sadr\u2019s movement in Sadr City.\nMr. Muslim said that if elected, he would work to fight corruption. He said that much of the money set aside by the Iraqi government and the United States for the reconstruction of Sadr City had been either delayed or entangled in corruption.\n\u201cThis period has benefited us, because it showed that all their promises were empty,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/world/middleeast/17iraq.html", "title": "Gunmen Kill Iraqi Cleric Campaigning for Council", "author": "SAM DAGHER"}
{"date": "Sun, 14 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Furious over a Russian ban on imported Belarussian milk products, the president of Belarus on Sunday boycotted a planned summit meeting of post-Soviet states whose centerpiece was the start of a joint military force formed by Russia and four of its closest allies.\nAs the so-called milk war with Moscow moved into its second week, the president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, released a statement saying that the ban \u201ceffectively forces Belarussians to their knees\u201d and that unless it is dropped, going ahead with the planned military force would be a \u201cmockery of common sense.\u201d\nMr. Lukashenko\u2019s abrupt no-show is bound to irritate Moscow, which was hoping to consolidate ties with its neighbors and end their flirtation with Western allies. President Dmitri A. Medvedev hastily assumed the presidency of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, which Belarus was scheduled to take over on Sunday, and inaugurated the military union in Moscow over Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s protests.\nMr. Medvedev tried to smooth over the \u201cmilk hysterics,\u201d saying he was certain that Belarussian leaders would see that signing the agreement was in their interests. Still, his annoyance was clear.\n\u201cIt is normal to address these situations like partners, which means, pick up the telephone and call,\u201d Mr. Medvedev said. \u201cAleksandr Grigorievich Lukashenko did not call me on the telephone, and did not tell me he was intending to make a decision to not attend.\u201d\nThe collective security agreement \u2014 which some see as an eventual counterweight to NATO \u2014 was signed by the leaders of Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan. It was not signed by Uzbekistan, which has raised objections to some provisions, or Belarus. Andrei Popov, a spokesman for Belarus\u2019s Foreign Ministry, told the Interfax news agency that the agreement was not valid because there was no consensus among members.\nTension between Belarus and Russia has been ratcheting up for weeks. Beginning June 6, Russia banned a list of around 1,200 Belarussian milk and dairy products, saying they violated new packaging rules imposed last year. The ban dealt a crushing blow to Belarus\u2019s dairy industry, which sends 95 percent of its exports to Russia.\nWhile Russian officials said the ban had no political overtones, Belarussian politicians have said they are being punished for defying Russian orders.\nOne outstanding issue is Belarus\u2019s refusal, so far, to formally recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two breakaway enclaves of Georgia, whose independence so far has been recognized by only Russia and Nicaragua. In an interview with the BelTA news agency earlier this month, Mr. Lukashenko said Russian officials made a $500 million loan contingent on recognition \u2014 something Russian officials deny.\n\u201cThe Republic of Belarus said long ago that it did not want to become an appendage of Russia, particularly an economic one,\u201d Syarhey Syamashka, a member of Parliament, told Belarussian television last week. \u201cBelarus is conducting its own independent domestic and foreign policy. Someone in Russia is bitterly unhappy about this.\u201d\nBelarus has long been financially dependent on Russia, as Mr. Medvedev pointed out dryly in his remarks on Sunday, but that relationship, too, is under strain. In late May, Russia\u2019s finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, withheld the $500 million, the last installment of a $2 billion loan, warning that the country could face default by the end of this year unless it overhauls its economic policy. Mr. Lukashenko reacted angrily.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not working out with Russia, let\u2019s not bow down, let\u2019s not whine and weep,\u201d he told a gathering of economic officials the next day, BelTA reported. \u201cLet\u2019s look for our happiness in a different part of the planet.\u201d\nMr. Lukashenko has few admirers in the West, where he is routinely criticized for human rights violations and heavy-handed political control. Nevertheless, after releasing a series of political prisoners this spring, Mr. Lukashenko was invited to join the European Union\u2019s Eastern Partnership, which aims to strengthen ties between Europe and six post-Soviet countries. Last week, the International Monetary Fund agreed to lend Belarus an additional $1 billion, increasing its total pledge to $3.4 billion.\nAs Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s statements grew heated in recent weeks, Russia responded with cool assurances that the relationship was healthy \u2014 and permanent.\n\u201cRussia has not made any insulting or any other statements that would suggest a \u2018divorce\u2019 between Russia and Belarus,\u201d Natalia Timakova, a spokeswoman for Mr. Medvedev, said this month. \u201cBelarus has always been and remains our strategic partner.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/world/europe/15belarus.html", "title": "\u2018Milk War\u2019 Strains Russia-Belarus Ties", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}
{"date": "Sat, 23 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 They call her the Iron Lady, the woman political analysts credit with helping rescue Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s second term as president of Brazil. Dilma Rousseff, Mr. da Silva\u2019s chief of staff, is also his chosen successor, expected to carry the banner of the hugely popular president into next year\u2019s election.\nBut the news that she is being treated for cancer has thrown a wild card into the presidential race, renewing speculation that Mr. da Silva would seek to change the Constitution and run for a third term himself.\nIt has also transformed Ms. Rousseff into a media obsession, with breathless updates on every development of her cancer treatment, from the wig she acknowledged wearing to the leg pains that forced her to check into a hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo early last week.\n\u201cDilma\u2019s disease upsets the whole electoral game in Brazil,\u201d said Amaury de Souza, a political analyst in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cPoliticians of all stripes and better informed voters are really having second thoughts about her candidacy.\u201d\nHe cites what he calls \u201cTancredo Neves syndrome,\u201d the post-election trauma of Tancredo Neves, a beloved Brazilian politician who became severely ill the day before he was to take office in 1985 and died without being sworn in.\nMs. Rousseff\u2019s very public health crisis began last month, when she revealed that doctors had removed a cancerous tumor from her chest. She began chemotherapy for lymphoma this month, and her oncologist has put her chances of complete recovery at 90 percent.\nMr. da Silva, whose job approval rating hovers around 75 percent, has stood by Ms. Rousseff, telling reporters in Beijing on Wednesday that he had talked to her doctors and remained convinced that she would be \u201ctotally cured.\u201d\nNevertheless, he has been forced to parry daily questions about whether he has a Plan B candidate, or whether he would pursue the constitutional change that would allow him to run again.\nHe has repeatedly said he would not, a point he said Wednesday did not even merit discussion. \u201cFirst, because there is no third term,\u201d he said, \u201cand second, because Dilma is fine.\u201d\nBut such denials have done little to quiet conjecture.\nNor would he be alone if he changed his mind. Many Latin countries adopted strict term limits in the 1970s and \u201980s to check authoritarian impulses after years of dictatorships. But lately the trend has been to loosen those laws.\nPresidents Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela and Rafael Correa of Ecuador have changed their Constitutions to allow them to run for additional terms. Supporters of President \u00c1lvaro Uribe in Colombia are pushing a measure to let him seek a third term.\nBrazil already changed its Constitution in 1997 to allow President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for and win a second term.\nMr. da Silva has vowed to be different.\n\u201cIf Lula says he is interested in a third term, then he loses the specialness of being a fresh, new kind of politician in Brazil,\u201d said Peter Hakim, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research group.\nWith the memories of a dictatorship that ended in 1985 still vivid here, an attempt to run again \u201cwould be seen by the people as a coup attempt,\u201d said Bolivar Lemounier, a political analyst in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nAs a practical matter it may be too late to change the Constitution, which would require four rounds of congressional voting. The amendment would have to be passed before Sept. 30 in order to be law one year before the election on Oct. 3, 2010.\nMs. Rousseff, 61, a former economist and oil minister who has never held an elected office, was little known outside the capital before cancer turned her into a celebrity. Most polls show her with less than 16 percent support, compared with her likely opposition candidate, Gov. Jos\u00e9 Serra of S\u00e3o Paulo, who commands more than 40 percent.\nBut her anointment by Mr. da Silva, who has steered Brazil through one of its greatest periods of prosperity, automatically made her a contender.\nShe became Mr. da Silva\u2019s chief of staff after her predecessor, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, was accused in 2005 of leading a scheme to buy votes in Congress. She has proved an able administrator, helping Mr. da Silva carry out his poverty-relief programs, manage the windfall from the commodities boom and oversee billions of dollars in large infrastructure projects.\nIn an interview here, she refused to discuss her prospective candidacy, saying it was too early, though she said whoever was allied with the president stood the best chance of winning.\nThe daughter of a Brazilian mother and a Bulgarian immigrant father, Ms. Rousseff was active in armed militant organizations in the 1960s fighting to oust the military dictatorship.\nShe said she regretted nothing of her militant past. But she said she never participated in an armed action against the government, despite Brazilian news reports claiming otherwise. She denied being involved in the most notorious episode tied to her, the 1969 armed robbery of $2.5 million from the S\u00e3o Paulo governor\u2019s safe.\nShe was captured and imprisoned in 1970 on charges of participating in an armed militant group. Sentenced to two years and one month, she ended up spending three years behind bars where, she said, she was tortured repeatedly with electric shocks.\nIn the interview, on May 12, she said that the cancer treatment was not affecting her work schedule. \u201cA flu is more inconvenient,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel fine.\u201d\nSince then, however, she has cut back her travel and failed to make at least four planned appearances.\nHer illness could cut both ways.\nIf she gets a clean bill of health, the media attention could elevate her name recognition and standing in opinion polls, said Christopher Garman, an analyst at Eurasia Group in Washington.\n\u201cThe impact of greater media coverage will probably trump\u201d the stigma of cancer, he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/world/americas/24brazil.html", "title": "The Health of a Likely Presidential Candidate Comes Under Brazil\u2019s Microscope", "author": "ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO"}
{"date": "Fri, 19 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TEHRAN \u2014 Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sternly cut off any compromise over the nation\u2019s disputed elections on Friday. In a long and hard-line sermon, he declared the elections valid and warned of violence if demonstrators continue, as they have pledged, to flood the streets in defiance of the government.\nOpposition leaders who failed to halt the protests, he said, \u201cwould be responsible for bloodshed and chaos.\u201d The tough words seemed to dash hopes for a peaceful solution to what defeated candidates and protesters call a fraudulent election last week, plunging Iran into its gravest crisis since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.\n\u201cFlexing muscles on the streets after the election is not right,\u201d he said, before tens of thousands of angry supporters at Tehran University. \u201cIt means challenging the elections and democracy. If they don\u2019t stop, the consequences of the chaos would be their responsibility.\u201d\nBut opposition leaders, who stayed home Friday, called for yet another huge rally on Saturday afternoon, setting the stage for a possible showdown between protesters and security forces, perhaps a violent one.\nThe sermon put Ayatollah Khamenei, who prefers to govern quietly and from behind the scenes, at the forefront of a confrontation not only among factions of the government but among Iranians themselves.\nIt also presents Mir Hussein Moussavi, whom the opposition says was the real winner of last Friday\u2019s elections, with an excruciating choice. The former prime minister and long-time insider must decide whether to escalate his challenge to Iran\u2019s supreme leader and risk a bloody showdown, or abandon his support for a popular uprising that his candidacy inspired.\nDuring the tough sermon, Ayatollah Khamenei tried to tamp down factional disputes among the elite, at one point even chastising pro-government militias and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for their role in the crisis. But he hardened his stance on the election results. On Monday, a crowd that the mayor of Tehran estimated at three million rallied for the first of four days, and Ayatollah Khamenei ordered an investigation into the election results, which declared Mr. Ahmadinejad the winner, with 63 percent to Mr. Moussavi\u2019s 34 percent. Then on Wednesday, the government invited Mr. Moussavi and the other two presidential candidates to meet with the Guardian Council, the powerful body that oversees the elections.\nBut the ayatollah said Friday that there was nothing to discuss, as he again endorsed the victory of Mr. Ahmadinejad, seated in the audience, and called the elections \u201can epic moment that has become a historic moment.\u201d He dismissed allegations of fraud.\n\u201cPerhaps 100,000 votes, or 500,000, but how can anyone tamper with 11 million votes?\u201d he asked as the crowd burst into laughter. \u201cIf the political elite ignore the law \u2014 whether they want it or not \u2014 they would be responsible for the bloodshed and chaos,\u201d he said.\nHe added that foreign agents were behind the street unrests and that there were efforts to stage a \u201cvelvet revolution.\u201d\n\u201cThey thought Iran is Georgia,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTheir problem is that they don\u2019t know this great nation yet.\u201d\nTens of thousands of Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s supporters gathered for the sermon. Television showed the streets filled with people near Tehran University.\nNewspapers said Thursday that a group of members of Parliament reported that the paramilitary forces of Basij were responsible for the attack on a dormitory in Tehran and a housing complex called Sobhan this week. Students said that five students \u2014 two women and three men \u2014 were killed in the attack.\nIn his sermon, Ayatollah Khamenei criticized those who carried out the attack. \u201cHave you calculated the impact of going to the dormitories in the name of the leader?\u201d he asked. \u201cMuscle-flexing after elections is not right. Put an end to this.\u201d\nThe nation\u2019s complex politics and maneuvering were on display in the sermon when he defended an influential politician and former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a bitter rival of Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s who many Iranians say is a major force in challenging the election.\nAyatollah Khamenei criticized Mr. Ahmadinejad for accusing Mr. Rafsanjani, his children and a former speaker of Parliament, Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri, of corruption during a televised debate, saying that both had risked their lives for the revolution.\n\u201cNo one had accused them of corruption,\u201d he said. But he did not remove the cloud of suspicion from Mr. Rafsanjani\u2019s children, noting that there had been accusations, unproven, against them.\nThere was no immediate reaction from Mehdi Karroubi, another presidential candidate who accused the government of fraud. Many analysts and aides to Mr. Moussavi have been arrested and were not available for comments. But the human rights group Amnesty International warned that Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s speech indicated that the authorities were willing to conduct a violent crackdown.\n\u201cWe are extremely disturbed at statements made by Ayatollah Khamenei which seem to give the green light to security forces to violently handle protesters exercising their right to demonstrate and express their views,\u201d the group said in a statement.\nIn a letter on Friday, Mr. Karroubi urged the Guardian Council to nullify the elections. \u201cThis is not the demand of an individual, it is the demand of the people,\u201d he wrote in a letter posted on his Web site. \u201cI warn you that insulting people would only intensify their rage.\u201d\nThe council is expected to meet with the three presidential candidates on Saturday.\nWeb sites associated with both Mr. Moussavi and Mr. Karroubi said that the large rally scheduled for Saturday was still on.\nIn Paris, a friend of Mr. Moussavi\u2019s who said he was acting as his spokesman said Friday that Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s statements would be met by large demonstrations.\n\u201cWhat happened is beyond cheating,\u201d the friend, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, a film director, said in a hastily organized news conference in Paris. \u201cSince Friday, a 30-year-old page was turned. We\u2019ve fallen into dictatorship. For the first time in 30 years there have been grass-roots demonstrations with millions of people, and these demonstrations stand as a proof that people want democracy.\u201d\nHis daughter Samira, also a filmmaker, said, \u201cUntil Friday we had 80 percent dictatorship and 20 percent democracy, and since Friday we have 100 percent dictatorship.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/world/middleeast/20iran.html", "title": "Iran\u2019s Top Leader Dashes Hopes for a Compromise", "author": "NAZILA FATHI"}

{"date": "Sun, 29 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Barely six months ago, the International Monetary Fund emerged from years of declining relevance, hurriedly cobbling together emergency loans for countries from Iceland to Pakistan, as the first wave of the financial crisis hit.\nNow, with world leaders gathering this week in London to plot a response to the gravest global economic downturn since World War II, the fund is becoming a chip in a contest to reshape the postcrisis landscape.\nThe Obama administration has made fortifying the I.M.F. one of its primary goals for the meeting of the Group of 20, which includes leading industrial and developing countries and the European Union. But China, India and other rising powers seem to believe that the made-in-America crisis has curtailed the ability of the United States to set the agenda. They view the Western-dominated fund as a place to begin staking their claim to a greater voice in global economic affairs.\nTreasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, who once worked at the fund, has called for its financial resources to be expanded by $500 billion, effectively tripling its lending capacity to distressed countries and cementing its status as the lender of last resort for much of the world.\nJapan and the European Union have each pledged $100 billion; the United States has signaled it will contribute a similar sum, though its money will take longer to arrive because of the need for Congressional approval. China, with its mammoth foreign exchange reserves, is the next obvious donor.\nYet officials of China and other developing countries have served notice that they are reluctant to make comparable pledges without getting a greater say in the operations of the fund, which is run by a Frenchman, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, and is heavily influenced by the United States and Western Europe.\nA senior Chinese leader, Wang Qishan, said Friday that Beijing was willing to kick in some money, but he called for an overhaul of the way the fund is governed. China wants its quota \u2014 which determines its financial contribution and voting power \u2014 adjusted to reflect its economic weight better.\nChina\u2019s contribution, Mr. Wang said, should not be based on the size of its reserves but on its economic output per person, which is still modest. Some American officials now expect a pledge on the order of $50 billion from China.\n\u201cTheir arms may yet be twisted, but they simply do not want to pony up based on vague promises of governance reform,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University who has discussed the matter in recent days with Chinese and Indian officials.\nGiven the inevitability that these countries will have a growing influence, the London summit meeting, which begins Thursday, is likely to be remembered \u201cas the last hurrah for the U.S. and Europe rescuing the world economy,\u201d said Simon Johnson, a professor at M.I.T. and a former chief economist of the fund.\nOne reason the I.M.F. has emerged as such a popular cause is that the United States has been unable to rally countries behind its other major priority: economic stimulus. The European Union opposes further stimulus packages in 2010, arguing that its social safety net makes an increase in government spending unnecessary.\nEuropean and American officials are also still divided, to a lesser degree, on how to rewrite international financial regulations. France and Germany are more receptive than the United States to giving regulators supranational authority to scrutinize global banks and other financial companies.\n\u201cThe United States is desperately trying to assert leadership, as if it were 10 years ago, when the U.S. set the agenda,\u201d said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economist at Harvard and another former chief economist of the fund.\nWith more countries slipping into crisis by the week, there is general agreement that the fund needs additional resources. Since last year, the I.M.F. has made nearly $50 billion in loans to 13 countries. It is streamlining the process for making loans and loosening its strings, hoping to counter the resentment that built up against it during past crises because of its stringent demands.\nAt a preparatory meeting two weeks ago, finance ministers of the Group of 20 agreed to \u201cvery substantially\u201d increase financing, though the Europeans favored an extra $250 billion, not $500 billion.\nWhatever their reservations about financing, the Chinese have seized on the fund for another purpose: to tweak the United States. The governor of China\u2019s central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, recently proposed that the American dollar be phased out as the world\u2019s default reserve currency. As a replacement, he suggested using special drawing rights, or S.D.R.\u2019s, the synthetic currency created by the fund that is used for transactions between it and its 185 member countries.\nFew economists view that idea as a realistic one, at least for years to come. But the mere assertion that the dollar\u2019s pre-eminence is waning \u2014 a theme picked up by Russian officials as well \u2014 sends a message.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Chinese or Russians really believe the S.D.R. is a viable currency,\u201d said Mr. Prasad, the Cornell economist. \u201cBut they\u2019re laying down a very clear marker that they\u2019re going to be much more assertive about their role.\u201d\nMr. Geithner took the remarks seriously enough that he publicly reaffirmed the primacy of the dollar.\nThe United States will address China\u2019s status this week, when it announces details of a new high-level strategic and economic dialogue with Beijing, led by Mr. Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, according to a senior administration official, who spoke anonymously because the information was not yet public. The announcement will come after the first meeting between President Obama and the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, in London.\nThe Obama administration has personal reasons to support the fund. Mr. Geithner was the I.M.F. director of policy planning from 2001 to 2003, after his first stint in the Treasury Department. He recruited Edwin M. Truman, another former Treasury official and a longtime advocate of the fund, as a temporary adviser to develop policies for the Group of 20 meeting.\nJust before leaving his academic position at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Mr. Truman proposed that the fund issue $250 billion in S.D.R.\u2019s on a one-time basis to be allocated to all its members, as another way of increasing its resources. Western European countries, he said, could use their S.D.R.\u2019s to lend money to their troubled Eastern neighbors.\nThat proposal is in a current draft of the statement to be issued at the Group of 20 meeting. If all the American proposals for the fund are adopted, its resources will approach $1 trillion \u2014 a big number, even in these extraordinary times.\nYet for Mr. Johnson of M.I.T., it merely shows how difficult it is for the United States to marshal support for anything else.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t agree on fiscal policy; they can\u2019t agree on regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing left is the I.M.F.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/world/30fund.html", "title": "Rising Powers Challenge U.S. on Role in I.M.F.", "author": "MARK LANDLER"}

The caterpillars have already been found in Guinea, and could appear in Ivory Coast, the world\u2019s top cocoa producer, which borders the region of the outbreak in Liberia, and Sierra Leone, United Nations officials said.\nThe outbreak was first reported in mid-January, when the black wormlike creatures set upon farms in northern Liberia.\nThe caterpillars seemed to appear out of thin air, said Winfred Hammond, representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization office in Liberia. \u201cThey were eating the forest trees, vegetation around homes and crops,\u201d he said. \u201cIt caused a lot of panic. People were fleeing their homes.\u201d\nInitially scientists thought that the caterpillars were army worms, which are hard to differentiate from the current pest when in the caterpillar form but look different when they turn into moths. Army worms are dreaded because they eat food crops and bury their larvae deep under the soil, which makes them tougher to attack with pesticides, United Nations officials said.\nBut further testing showed that the caterpillars were actually Achaea catocaloides rena, a species that only rarely appears in such great numbers. The caterpillars live in the forest, and their population is usually kept down by wasps that lay eggs on the moth\u2019s cocoon and eat the caterpillars, Mr. Hammond said.\nBut the rains last year were unusual. Downpours as late as Christmas may have interrupted the reproduction cycle of the wasps that prey on the caterpillars, Mr. Hammond said.\nThe caterpillars eat the leaves of plants, and then the moths burrow into fruit, causing it to rot. When the caterpillars run out of leaves, they set upon food crops like millet and wheat.\nScientists from Liberia and its neighbors plan to meet Friday to discuss how to keep the infestation from spreading. Because the moths pupate on the surface rather than underground, they are easier to destroy, United Nations officials said. But the current swarm is turning into moths, which will then reproduce and make an even bigger infestation likely, Mr. Hammond said.\n\u201cYou need to target them at just the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get this under control, a lot of people are going to suffer.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/world/africa/06liberia.html", "title": "Swarm of Caterpillars Infests West Africa, Menacing Crops", "author": "LYDIA POLGREEN"}

The case has caused considerable concern among Tibetans and Chinese human rights lawyers.\nThe abbot, Phurbu Tsering Rinpoche, 51, was detained by security forces on May 18, four days after a protest by more than 80 nuns from the two convents he leads in the restive area of Ganzi in Sichuan Province.\nThe nuns\u2019 protest was one of many in Tibetan regions after ethnic rioting erupted in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, in March 2008, prompting a crackdown from Beijing and waves of detentions.\nProsecutors charged the abbot with weapons possession, saying the police found a pistol and about 130 bullets in his living room, according to one defense lawyer, Jiang Tianyong. The court also charged the abbot with embezzlement after prosecutors accused him of trying to illegally take possession of a home for the elderly that he runs.\nThe abbot is considered a tulku by Tibetans and called a living Buddha in Chinese \u2014 an especially revered figure who is believed to be the essence of a prominent religious leader.\nIf convicted on both charges, as is expected, he could be sentenced to 15 years in prison, Mr. Jiang said.\nHe said the charges were unfounded and motivated by politics.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of evidence on the weapons charge, and the embezzlement charge is ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Jiang said. \u201cThe living Buddha predicted that the government would arrest him because some nuns from his convents took to the streets to protest.\u201d\nCalls to the two courts in Ganzi that are involved in the case went unanswered Friday.\nThe Tibetan issue is one of the most intractable political and security problems for China. Many Tibetans resent rule by the Chinese; the riots in Lhasa focused on the Han Chinese, members of the country\u2019s largest ethnic group.\nMr. Jiang was one of 21 Han lawyers who signed a petition last year announcing that they would help defend Tibetans. Government officials met with the lawyers and told them not to take on any cases, he said. But he traveled with a colleague, Li Fangping, from Beijing last week to take on the case. Both are prominent human rights lawyers.\n\u201cWe hoped that this kind of issue could be solved through law, through legal procedures,\u201d Mr. Jiang said.\n\u201cThis is beneficial to the relationship between Tibetans and Han Chinese, because they\u2019re citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and they\u2019re entitled to be protected by the law.\u201d\nAfter the Chinese government sent security forces across western China to crack down on the protests last year, the nuns at the two convents in Ganzi were told to sign papers denouncing the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. However, the nuns refused and marched instead, according to Woeser, a prominent Tibetan blogger who has written about the case and who follows the Tibetan tradition of using a single name.\nAt least a dozen of the nuns have been sentenced for unknown crimes, and six are still being detained, Ms. Woeser said in an interview.\nBeijing sent thousands of troops into Tibetan areas this winter and spring to prevent any protests during the 50th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against the Chinese.\nIn recent weeks, there have been a spate of sentences related to the 2008 uprising.On Tuesday, a court sentenced three Tibetans convicted of setting or helping set a deadly fire during the rioting in Lhasa. One was given a death sentence with a two-year reprieve, which can be commuted later. A second was given life in prison, and a third was given 10 years in prison.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/world/asia/25tibet.html", "title": "Senior Tibetan Cleric Faces Prison in China", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}
{"date": "Tue, 06 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 It is an all-too-familiar political story.\nFirst there was the electoral drubbing at the hands of a center-left juggernaut. Next came the recriminations, with party leaders taking nasty, public swipes at one another in dueling magazine articles, op-ed articles and talk show appearances. Then came the agonizing debate: should the party lurch rightward to consolidate its base, or rush toward the center to attract moderate voters? And finally, the purge: party members who do not make the ideological cut are cast out or pushed aside.\nIf the script sounds familiar to those who have followed American politics in the last year, this one is playing out in the majestic, colonial-era halls of power in India\u2019s capital, where the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., which seemed almost unstoppable when it swept into power a decade ago, is at risk of slipping into irrelevance.\nThe descent of the B.J.P., India\u2019s second-largest political party, has once again raised a question that has pricked at the world\u2019s most populous democracy since its independence from Britain in 1947: Will the country ever produce a true rival to the Congress Party, which has governed for most of the last 62 years? And if it does not, what does that mean for India\u2019s democracy?\nIts onetime winning formula, combining a muscular nationalism with pro-market reforms and pledges of good government, fell flat in the face of a revitalized Congress Party in parliamentary elections in May.\nThe bad news did not stop there, keeping India\u2019s lively political press gleefully busy with one scandal after another. The squabbling reached its peak two months ago when the party expelled one of its stalwarts, Jaswant Singh, for writing a book that lionized the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\nSince its release in August, Mr. Singh\u2019s book, \u201cJinnah: India \u2014 Partition \u2014 Independence,\u201d has shaken the B.J.P. Mr. Singh was summarily expelled from the party, and Gujarat, one of India\u2019s wealthiest states and a bastion of B.J.P. support, tried to ban his book. Its main offense is that it does not blame Mr. Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, for the partition of British India in 1947, but Jawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first prime minister.\nThe battle over Mr. Singh\u2019s book is merely the latest development in what has been a grim political struggle for the soul of the party. The party was once so successful that it seemed that the Hindu nationalist fervor that brought it to the fore might transform the secular, diverse nation that is modern India into one guided and dominated by a single faith.\nIn the 1980s and \u201990s the defiant pose of Hindu nationalism fit well with the mood in India, which was tired of being seen as an impoverished nation forever hobbled by experiments with socialism and inept public administration. Hindutva, as the ideology was known, cultivated a tougher image that matched India\u2019s global aspirations.\nIf the Congress Party, which has governed India for much of its history, gave India freedom, then the B.J.P. gave it self-respect in a world accustomed to thinking of it in terms of human suffering.\nBut in the 21st century, India has become an emerging power whose voice rumbles with growing authority. The old insecurities that drove middle-class Hindus toward the B.J.P. seem to have melted away.\nTo many political observers, the B.J.P. got precisely the defeat it deserved. It failed, the argument goes, to present a coherent alternative to the Congress Party, which had governed in a shaky coalition with decidedly underwhelming results for five years.\nIn this context, what seems like an intramural squabble in a party still nursing its wounds from a nasty whipping has much broader consequences.\n\u201cWe are going back into a period of Congress dominance,\u201d said Prem Shankar Jha, an analyst who writes frequently on politics. \u201cBut it is an insecure dominance, which always leads to very bad governance.\u201d\nRamachandra Guha, an Indian historian, said the B.J.P.\u2019s implosion made it nearly impossible for the party to play the much-needed role of loyal opposition, keeping the governing party in line.\n\u201cClearly we need some kind of robust alternative to the Congress,\u201d Mr. Guha said. \u201cOne does not want the Congress to acquire a sense of invincibility.\u201d\nBut if recent events are any guide, the B.J.P. is too busy with its internal tussles to take on the governing party. Such battles have served only to remind voters of the kinds of narrow causes the party has championed in the past, often with tragic results.\nOne is its support for the reconstruction of a temple at the site in the state of Uttar Pradesh that Hindu nationalists believe to be the birthplace of Ram. In 1992, rampaging Hindu mobs destroyed a mosque that had been built there, and spasms of religious violence reverberated in India for years afterward, culminating a decade later in riots in Gujarat that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims.\nWhile such issues fire up the party\u2019s base of militant, upper-caste Hindus, they have over the years alienated many voters from the party.\n\u201cMiddle-class voters seemed embarrassed that in the 21st century they should be asked to debate India\u2019s future on the basis of a dispute over a medieval mosque,\u201d Vir Sanghvi, a columnist for The Hindustan Times, wrote this summer.\nThe Congress Party\u2019s huge victory in parliamentary elections in May was celebrated as a chance to end the fractious era of messy coalition politics that had held back major reforms.\nBut in the past, long periods of virtually unchallenged Congress rule have not been particularly kind to India. It is no coincidence, analysts say, that India\u2019s rise as a global economic powerhouse really took off as the B.J.P. became a viable national alternative to Congress.\nIn a speech to the party faithful after the electoral defeat, the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s candidate for prime minister, the octogenarian L.K. Advani, was almost valedictory, saying that his party, whatever its failures, had broken the Congress\u2019s lock on national power.\n\u201cIn the last two decades the B.J.P. has succeeded in transforming this single dominant party polity into a bipolar polity,\u201d he said.\nSudheendra Kulkarni, a senior party member who quit the B.J.P. after the flap over the Jinnah book, said the party had fallen flat because it misread voters. It is less clear where the party goes now.\n\u201cWe focused on negatives when the people wanted a positive, superior agenda for governance and development,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want India to grow steadily on this path, with no disturbances and no turmoil.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/world/asia/07india.html", "title": "Politicians in India Turn Against One Another", "author": "LYDIA POLGREEN"}

Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin attended the service, standing prominently near the front of Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow, a church that was blown up on Stalin\u2019s orders in 1931 and lavishly rebuilt after the fall of the Soviet Union.\nIn a short address at the end of the service, Mr. Medvedev said that the enthronement of a new patriarch offered \u201cnew conditions for a full-fledged dialogue\u201d between the church and the state.\nHe also said that Russia\u2019s diversity placed extra responsibility on the patriarch. \u201cRussia is a complicated state, inhabited by many different peoples, by followers of different faiths, and in this sense also the mission of the patriarch of Moscow and All Russia is extremely notable,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\nLikewise, Patriarch Kirill, 62, who has been taken to task in some quarters for the political tone of his sermons, addressed social and political themes on Sunday.\n\u201cIt is our Christian duty to take care of those who are suffering, of orphans and the poor, of invalids and the aged, imprisoned and homeless, of everyone whom we can help to find hope,\u201d he said in softer tones than he had previously employed. \u201cThe voice of the church must become also the voice of the weak and those deprived of power, of those seeking justice.\u201d\nKirill, who as chairman of the church\u2019s external relations department oversaw the drafting of a document on social issues in 2000, is expected to weigh in on social and political issues more frequently than his predecessor did. The document addressed issues like abortion, globalization and poverty. At a Christmas service attended by Mr. Medvedev, Kirill spoke pointedly about the financial crisis.\n\u201cHe is without a doubt more politicized than Aleksy,\u201d said Nikolai Mitrokhin, a church historian at the Center for East European Studies at the University of Bremen in Germany. \u201cThis is connected with his personal convictions. Primarily, he is more interested in politics, in pure politics.\u201d\nHe is also known for his strong nationalism, ecumenical activities and defense of traditional values, and for his use of television and the Internet to spread those messages.\nHe has been criticized by some and lauded by others for promoting ties with other churches, notably the Roman Catholic Church.\nOn Sunday, representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, led by Cardinal Walter Kasper, attended the service and several joined the procession at the end to kiss the cross held by Kirill, drawing sharp gasps from at least a few worshipers.\nIn another sign of outreach, Metropolitan Vladimir of Kiev, the leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, handed Kirill a staff that once belonged to a 14th-century Russian metropolitan, a gesture meant to demonstrate unity. The church in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, has been divided over calls for independence from the Russian church.\nMr. Putin did not speak at the ceremony but joined Mr. Medvedev at the cathedral\u2019s altar to witness Kirill\u2019s ascension to the patriarchal throne.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church, estimated to have more than 140 million members, is the largest Orthodox church in the world.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/world/europe/02patriarch.html", "title": "Russian Leaders Attend Installation of Orthodox Patriarch", "author": "SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY"}

Residents worked through the night to pull victims from the rubble and treat the 43 people who were wounded.\nThe death toll might have been worse, officials said, had they not stopped a second vehicle packed with explosives before its driver could detonate them. The driver was killed by the Kurdish pesh merga forces that provide security for the area, the officials said.\nWardak is a tiny village with about 300 houses. Three sides of the village are protected by sand berms, with a shallow river providing a fourth barrier. Nevertheless, two suicide bombers drove through the river under the cover of night, arriving shortly after midnight, local officials said.\nWhile the pesh merga fired at the first driver, he still managed to reach the town and detonate his bomb, officials said.\n\u201cI was in my house when I heard shooting,\u201d said Amjad Kamel, 49. \u201cThere was more shooting, and then I heard a huge explosion.\u201d His roof collapsed, he said, and in the darkness it seemed to him as if he had been swept away in a sandstorm.\nMany villagers were sleeping on their rooftops, trying to keep cool, and local officials said that was fortunate because it allowed many to escape being crushed when their houses collapsed.\nJalal Talabani, Iraq\u2019s president and the highest-ranking Kurdish member of the government, released a statement condemning the killings.\nSecurity officials say that in recent weeks extremists have been seeking to aggravate the already tense relations between Iraq\u2019s Shiite-led government in Baghdad and the largely autonomous Kurdistan region in the north.\nMahmoud Othman, a Kurdish member of Parliament, said political fighting between Kurdish leaders and the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki was the main reason that security in Nineveh Province, where the bombing took place, had remained a problem.\n\u201cNo security can be maintained in such an unstable political atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cTerrorists exploit such situations.\u201d\nEven as Americans prepare to withdraw from Iraq, they are trying to refocus their attention on the northern region, particularly the boundary between Kurdistan and the rest of the country, which they call the fault line.\nGen. Ray Odierno, the American commander in Iraq, said there had been discussions about forming joint patrols in the north, but no agreement.\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s been clear in the discussions we\u2019ve had is that all parties involved are concerned about Al Qaeda and the fact that they\u2019re exploiting the disputed areas,\u201d he said in an interview this week. \u201cAnd everyone wants to stop Al Qaeda\u2019s capability to exploit these areas.\u201d\nMr. Othman said that Kurdish forces would like to see the Americans step up their role in the area, but that Arab and Turkmen leaders were wary because of the longstanding ties between the United States and the Kurds.\nInsurgent attacks continued in and around Baghdad on Thursday, with at least 4 people killed and 37 wounded in three bombings.\nIn Diyala Province, an ethnically and religiously mixed area that has long harbored extremists, a suicide bomber attacked a convoy carrying a local political leader. The leader, Ahmed al-Zarkoshi, was unharmed but a bystander was killed along with the attacker.\nIn an attack in the town of Hilla, south of Baghdad, two bombs exploded at a local market, according to a security official in the town.

He said the groups had been loyal to Iraq\u2019s former leader, Saddam Hussein, but provided no further details.\nThe Friday meeting often broke down, as the two top ministers disagreed over which agency has responsibility for providing security in Baghdad.\nAbdul Qadir al-Obaidi, the defense minister, said that Baghdad security was not the responsibility of the army, but rather, the Interior Ministry, according to several people present.\nJawad Bolani, the interior minister, shot back, saying that it was not his agency\u2019s responsibility, but instead fell under the control of a special \u201cBaghdad command,\u201d established during the crisis of sectarian killings in the capital and reporting directly to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, according to the witnesses.\nAs the heated exchange played out, Maj. Gen. Abud Qanbar, the head of Baghdad Operations Command, sat silently.\n\u201cThe absence of coordination among the security agencies was obvious,\u201d said Zainab Kenani, a Shiite lawmaker, \u201cIn today\u2019s meeting we found out that each agency works alone without coordinating with the others, and it seems that no one knows what the other one is doing.\u201d\nThe Interior Ministry, which oversees both the national and the local police, and the Iraqi Army, whose soldiers have worked the closest with Americans, are the two main agencies charged with providing security. However, the Baghdad Operations Command has been active in the capital since it was set up in 2007.\nThere is, moreover, a struggle for control of the nation\u2019s six separate, and in some ways competing, intelligence services.\nUntil June, American combat troops stationed in Baghdad worked directly with the Iraqi forces to ease friction between agencies.\nBut since the United States military has pulled back from the cities, those tensions are becoming more evident, with some lawmakers expressing concern that the Baghdad command structure itself is primarily a way, and possibly not a legal one, for Mr. Maliki\u2019s government to have a greater role in security decisions.\nAt a news conference after the meeting, there were hints at the disagreements that had taken place inside. Mr. Bolani, the interior minister, who may challenge Mr. Maliki in January\u2019s national elections, noted pointedly that the Baghdad command structure had been set up during a time of crisis, implying that there was no longer any need for it.\nSome of the harshest criticism was directed at the intelligence services, which did not have a representative at the meeting. Lawmakers, who two months ago trumpeted the departure of American troops from the cities as a great national victory, noted Friday that they were still reliant on Americans for technical support in intelligence gathering, and suggested that they might ask for added assistance.\nBut there was no indication that they would ask for any increase in visible assistance.\nOn Thursday, a day after the bombings in Baghdad, a string of attacks south of the city killed at least 8 people and wounded 93 more. However, an Iraqi Army official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said that an offer by American troops stationed nearby to assist in the effort to hunt down those responsible was turned down by top officials at the Defense Ministry.\nThere were more attacks on Friday, including a bomb at a vegetable market in Baghdad that killed 2 people and wounded 20. In northern Iraq, west of Mosul, two policemen were shot and killed by gunmen.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/world/middleeast/22iraq.html", "title": "After Blasts, Iraqi Officials Point Fingers", "author": "MARC SANTORA and ABEER MOHAMMED"}
{"date": "Fri, 01 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PARIS \u2014 Rising unemployment, static wages and anger at national governments over the depth of the financial crisis brought hundreds of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets of Europe on Friday to mark the traditional workers\u2019 May Day holiday.\nBut though there were tense confrontations and sporadic episodes of violence reported in Germany, Greece and Turkey, the protests were generally peaceful, and in some areas there was a calm that suggested that people had used the holiday to extend their weekend.\nStill, May Day this year came at a delicate moment. The economic crisis is dragging on and a palpable sense of outrage is growing among those who have lost their jobs, savings or pension funds. Worker solidarity was on display most visibly in France, where the eight main unions marched together for the first time.\nIn Paris, members of the two largest unions \u2014 the General Confederation of Labor and the French Democratic Confederation of Labor \u2014 were joined by the other principal unions, as well as an array of left-wing parties, anarchists, civil liberty and human rights campaigners, and even a group concerned about the disappearance of bees.\nThe General Confederation said that it had registered more than 283 events, protests and marches across France, double the number of events last year. It estimated the national turnout at around 1.2 million, five times larger than a year earlier, and at 160,000 in Paris. The national police had more conservative numbers, estimating the number of demonstrators across France at 465,000, and 65,000 in Paris, including some 8,500 ethnic Tamils protesting for an independent homeland in Sri Lanka.\nThe police cited no major episodes of violence as of early Friday evening.\n\u201cFor some, the mood is hardening,\u201d said John Monks, the general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, which represents 82 trade union organizations in 36 European countries. \u201cIt\u2019s switching from worry to frustration and anger. This is the most important May the 1st in a long time.\u201d\nMr. Monks said workers were \u201cpaying to rescue the financial sector\u201d and they now wanted \u201csomething back\u201d from the state.\nThe rise in unemployment is being particularly felt in the blue-collar sector as plants are shuttered to compensate for slumping external demand.\nThe jobless rate in the European bloc using the euro was 8.5 percent in February, up from 7.2 percent a year earlier, according to the European Union\u2019s statistics agency.\nFrance in particular has been the scene of mounting anger. After a strike in France on Jan. 29, when more than one million people marched, President Nicolas Sarkozy offered $3.4 billion in aid to low-paid and unemployed workers, in addition to an existing stimulus package. But despite another nationwide strike in March, he has held back from instituting further measures.\nIn some European cities, protests, though more modest in scale, had more of an edge.\nDozens of police officers were injured in Berlin and in Hamburg, Germany, but the authorities there said there was less violence than on previous May Day holidays. The Berlin police were expecting further demonstrations in the evening by anarchists and other groups.\nSome of the worst clashes between protesters and the police took place early in the morning in Friedrichshain, a district in east Berlin where 48 riot police officers were hurt and 49 people were arrested, according to the police.\nSome 200 protesters, chanting anti-capitalist slogans, threw bottles and stones at the police and set five cars on fire. The police, however, said that the majority of protests ended peacefully.\nThe biggest gathering took place at the Brandenburg Gate in the center of Berlin, where the Federation of German Trade unions held its traditional May Day rally. More than 20,000 people attended as speakers criticized the role of managers in the financial crisis.\nIn Turkey, May Day protests have often been violent in the past, and a number of clashes were reported Friday.\nTaksim Square in the center of Istanbul was opened by the authorities to unions and other groups for the first time in decades, and an estimated 5,000 protesters gathered there, chanting slogans, singing and waving flags.\nOn side streets, youths threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the police, who responded with volleys of tear gas and water canons.\nIstanbul was virtually shut down, with most of its main roads blocked, and its metro and tram services shut down. Eight people were injured, according to NTV, a private television network.\nMeanwhile, police officers used flash grenades to disperse violent protesters in Athens after attacks on banks and traffic cameras, The Associated Press reported, adding that no arrests or injuries were reported. Transport strikes disrupted bus, train and ferry services as well as flights by Olympic Airlines.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/world/europe/02france.html", "title": "Anger and Fear Fuel May Day Europe Protests", "author": "MATTHEW SALTMARSH"}

The American relationship with Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province, is one of the most delicate diplomatic issues between Beijing and Washington. The United States takes no position on the sovereignty of Taiwan, but acknowledges that Beijing claims that there is only one China.\nIn the past week, Chinese officials and news organizations have expressed anger over reports that the Obama administration could notify Congress shortly of such arms sales. Notification is the final step in the process. American officials here say China could break off military-to-military contacts with the United States once notification is made. When the Pentagon announced in October 2008, under the Bush administration, that it was selling Taiwan $6.5 billion worth of weapons, China froze the military ties and did not resume the contacts until after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Beijing in February.\nOne of the biggest questions is whether the United States will sell advanced F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan. Officials under President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan continue to call for such jets; Taiwan has older models it bought in 1992. In 2008, the United States canceled a deal to sell 66 of the jets to Taiwan after China strongly objected. Mr. Burghardt said that the sale of F-16s was \u201cunder study.\u201d\nOn Dec. 9, Reuters quoted Robert Kovac, a State Department official in Washington, as saying that the White House was preparing to notify Congress about a package of arms sales, including design work on diesel-electric submarines and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. Foreign Policy magazine also reported online that arms sales might occur soon.\nLast Thursday, Chinese officials denounced any potential arms sales. \u201cChina is strongly against U.S. arms sales to Taiwan,\u201d said Jiang Yu, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.\nThe English-language edition of the Global Times newspaper ran a headline that irked United States officials in Beijing after Mr. Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday: \u201cPeace Prize winner to sell arms.\u201d\nBefore Mr. Obama\u2019s trip to China last month, senior White House officials began laying out the administration\u2019s policy toward Taiwan. Jeffrey Bader, the senior director for East Asian affairs in the National Security Council, said in a speech in early November at the Brookings Institution that arms sales to Taiwan would continue.\nAmerican arms sales to Taiwan are governed by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, passed after the United States established diplomatic relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China. It says the United States government \u201cwill make available to Taiwan\u201d arms of a defensive nature.\nMr. Burghardt said the package put together by the White House would presumably include \u201cadvanced capability\u201d Patriot missiles, which were among the items in the 2008 package.\nMost arms in that package had been approved for sale in April 2001, but the Taiwan government, for domestic political reasons, took a long time to assemble the financing, Mr. Burghardt said. Likewise, he added, the arms that Mr. Obama would present have already been approved.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/world/asia/16taiwan.html", "title": "Arms Sales to Taiwan Will Proceed, U.S. Says", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

{"date": "Fri, 13 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JOHANNESBURG \u2014 On the very day Zimbabwe\u2019s new coalition government was sworn in, agents of President Robert Mugabe\u2019s security forces on Friday arrested Roy Bennett, the third highest ranking member of the opposition party that is supposed to share power with Mr. Mugabe.\nThe authorities picked up Mr. Bennett, the treasurer general of the Movement for Democratic Change and the nominee to become deputy agriculture minister, at a small airport in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe. His party said Friday evening that the authorities originally charged Mr. Bennett with trying to leave the country illegally, then later with treason, punishable by death. Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government had recently linked Mr. Bennett once again to a plot allegedly hatched in 2006 to destabilize the government \u2014 a charge Mr. Bennett has denied.\nMr. Bennett was about to board a flight to Johannesburg, where he has lived in exile in recent years, for a celebration of his 52nd birthday on Monday, his wife, Heather, said in a telephone interview. He had planned to fly back to Harare to be sworn in on Wednesday along with the other deputy ministers appointed by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change. \u201cI spoke to him just an hour ago,\u201d Mrs. Bennett said Friday afternoon. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s been worried the whole time he\u2019s been in Zimbabwe, but Morgan had said to him it would be fine to fly out.\u201d\nMr. Bennett\u2019s arrest raises more questions about how much clout Mr. Tsvangirai will have under a power-sharing agreement with Mr. Mugabe, who has run the country with an iron hand since 1980. Mr. Tsvangirai outpolled Mr. Mugabe in elections last March, but ended his campaign just days before a run-off in June because of violence against thousands of his supporters.\nSpokesmen for the police and the Information Ministry could not be reached for comment on Friday.\nThe treason charges leveled against Mr. Bennett, whose coffee farm was seized during the Mugabe government\u2019s push to confiscate white-owned land, are nothing new for the opposition. Mr. Tsvangirai himself was charged with treason, tried in 2004 and acquitted. Last week, a judge withdrew treason charges against Tendai Biti, the second-ranking official in the party and the finance minister in the new coalition government.\nThe Movement for Democratic Change said Mr. Bennett had been taken to the police station in Mutare, in eastern Zimbabwe; it said that the police had fired live ammunition into the air and taken dogs to disperse a crowd of opposition party supporters who gathered to demand his release, but that the crowd remained there on Friday evening.\nIn a power-sharing deal negotiated last month under the auspices of regional leaders from across southern Africa, Mr. Tsvangirai and a small breakaway faction of the opposition will have a one-vote edge in cabinet ministers over Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF party. But Mr. Mugabe retained control over the military and the intelligence agency and insisted on shared control of the police \u2014 giving him a continued hold over the security forces he has employed for years to repress his political opponents.\nMr. Tsvangirai had sought the release of dozens of opposition and human rights activists abducted by security agents in recent months as a condition for joining the government, but relented when Mr. Mugabe refused to free them.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Tsvangirai had an emotional reunion with 16 of his people at Chikurubi prison in Harare, his spokesman, Joseph Mungwari, said. Many of them have submitted affidavits that they were tortured to extract false confessions of their involvement in plots to topple Mr. Mugabe. They are yet to be released on bail.\nSince Mr. Bennett returned to Zimbabwe after Mr. Tsvangirai agreed to enter the government, there have been intimations in the state news media that Mr. Bennett might be picked up in connection with an arms cache found in a home in 2006 \u201ctied to attempts to instigate civil strife in the country,\u201d the state-owned Herald, a mouthpiece for Mr. Mugabe, reported two weeks ago.\nMr. Bennett had heard he was being sought by the authorities and, concerned for his safety, spent Thursday night at the German Embassy in Harare, his wife said Friday. She said that when she told him she was worried, he replied, \u201cYou can\u2019t keep hiding.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/world/africa/14zimbabwe.html", "title": "Zimbabwe Opposition Party Official Arrested", "author": "CELIA W.

{"date": "Thu, 02 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The first major operation launched with the additional troops ordered to Afghanistan by President Obama is devised to clear Taliban havens across a strategic southern province \u2014 and then, in a marked departure from past practice, to leave clusters of Marines in small bases close to the villagers they were sent to guard and aid, according to senior military officers.\nDespite the troops\u2019 substantial numbers and firepower, the strategy is not without risks. Indeed, on Thursday, the first Marine was killed in the operation.\nAlthough American and allied forces have previously swept through the province, Helmand, killing or capturing as many guerrillas as they could, often with airstrikes, the military has never before had enough ground troops to hold onto large areas that were cleared of insurgent fighters in combat operations.\nThis time, a force of about 4,000 Marines, which arrived just weeks ago, was joined by 650 Afghan soldiers in the sweep into Helmand Province, a hotbed of Taliban activity and the largest producer of the opium poppies that are a major source of money for the insurgency.\n\u201cEssentially what they are trying to do is create and sustain a productive presence in Helmand Province, including both combat power and civil-engagement capabilities,\u201d a senior military officer said.\n\u201cThis is not simply to remove Taliban influence, but to replace that influence with security operations and reconstruction,\u201d the officer said. \u201cIt is not simply about killing the enemy, but about protecting the population and improving their lives, which will help prohibit the return of insurgent elements.\u201d\nCommanders promised that the Marines would remain in significant numbers, setting up many small operating and logistics bases among the population. That tactic was central to the success of the so-called troop surge in Iraq.\nMarines pushed into three significant towns along a 75-mile stretch of the Helmand River south of Lashkar Gah on Thursday, encountering sporadic resistance that grew throughout the afternoon, a Marine spokesman said.\nThe Marines now have a presence in Nawa and Garmsir in central Helmand Province, and in Khan Neshin in southern Helmand, said a spokesman for Marine forces in the province, Capt. Bill Pelletier. He described the contact with Taliban fighters as \u201cmostly hit and run.\u201d Some Marines were treated for heat exhaustion because temperatures reached 110 degrees, he said.\nThe mission appears to be intended to show residents that the troops are there to protect them and to prevent civilian casualties, either from NATO and American forces or from the Taliban.\nCaptain Pelletier said the Marines have used no artillery or bombs from aircraft, in an effort to show that the operation is focused more on protecting people than on killing the enemy. \u201cThe success of this operation is going to be dependent on how the populace views this, not just in how we deal with the enemy,\u201d he said.\nBut perils of the Iraq mission are lurking in the shadows of this operation as well. Although the American military is capable of clearing insurgents from an area and may even have the numbers to hold that territory, the troops will be exposed to ambush and roadside bombs as they patrol villages. And it remains unclear whether the civilian agencies representing the Afghan, American and allied governments are prepared to take on the job of stabilization and reconstruction quickly and successfully.\nIan C. Kelly, the State Department spokesman, said in Washington that two civilians \u2014 one from the State Department and one from the Agency for International Development \u2014 were working in Helmand Province, and that an additional development officer would arrive this weekend, with three more to follow in the next several weeks.\nIn May, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates visited several hundred Marines who had just landed at Camp Leatherneck as the vanguard of more than 20,000 additional troops ordered to Afghanistan by Mr. Obama. At the time, many of the Marines had not even received their equipment. \u201cHad we not added resources to this fight, we would not be able to conduct an operation on this scale this quickly,\u201d said another senior military officer involved in the mission.\nBomb Kills Senior British Officer\nLONDON (Reuters) \u2014 One of the most senior British army officers in Afghanistan was killed by a roadside bomb in Helmand Province, the Defense Ministry said Thursday. The officer, Lt. Col.

{"date": "Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The amount of money sent home in April by Mexicans working in the United States fell by almost one-fifth compared with a year earlier, the central bank said Monday, marking the largest decline since the authorities began keeping track of such transfers.\nRemittances, as the transfers are known, have been sliding since the end of 2007, when the construction industry in the United States began its sharp decline. Many Mexicans who had found work in building and landscaping during the boom years quickly lost their jobs. Then, as the overall United States economy fell into a recession, Mexicans in other industries, including restaurants and manufacturing, also lost their jobs.\nBut the pace of decline in the money transfers gathered speed this year, falling 8.7 percent over the first four months compared with the same period last year, the central bank, the Bank of Mexico, reported. Migrants sent $1.8 billion in April, 18.7 percent less than in April 2008.\nThere is no single explanation for the sharper drop in April, said Eliseo D\u00edaz Gonz\u00e1lez, an economist who studies remittances at the College of the Northern Border outside Tijuana.\nMigrants have either lost their jobs or taken jobs with lower pay. At the same time, without good prospects of finding work in the United States, many Mexicans have decided not to risk crossing the border illegally.\n\u201cWe are seeing the aggravation of all these trends,\u201d Mr. D\u00edaz said. \u201cWith opportunities for employment in the United States shutting off, we cannot continue to export labor to the United States anymore. The prize for migrating no longer exists.\u201d\nPhilip Martin, an expert on migration at the University of California, Davis, said it was too early to say if the sharp drop would be repeated in the statistics for May. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be down in 2009,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the question is how much.\u201d\nAlong with the big jump in unemployment in construction and the decline in new arrivals \u2014 who tend to send more money \u2014 Mr. Martin said a possible factor in the newly released figures was that some illegal immigrants might have paid taxes in April in the hope of an eventual amnesty.\nLast year, remittances fell 3.6 percent compared with the previous year, to $25 billion. In a recent report, the Bank of Mexico said Mexicans in the United States were disproportionately employed in sectors of the economy, like construction, that had declined the fastest. In addition, a crackdown on illegal immigration, both along the border and in the workplace, has made it harder for Mexicans to find jobs.\nAlthough remittances are one of Mexico\u2019s largest single sources of foreign exchange, their effect is concentrated in particular states and regions. Remittances have helped to reduce poverty in those areas, but that could be reversed if the steep decline continues, Mr. D\u00edaz said.\nApril was a particularly difficult month for the Mexican economy. Another source of foreign exchange, the tourism industry, was devastated in April by the outbreak of swine flu.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/world/americas/02mexico.html", "title": "Money Sent Home by Mexican Workers in U.S. Falls Sharply", "author": "ELISABETH MALKIN"}
{"date": "Tue, 10 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CRAIGAVON, Northern Ireland \u2014 Barely three days after two British soldiers were shot to death by a dissident faction of the Irish Republican Army, another I.R.A. breakaway group claimed responsibility on Tuesday for an ambush that killed a police officer on Monday night in this town 25 miles southwest of Belfast.\nThe officer, identified as Stephen Carroll, a 48-year-old married man with three children, was shot in the head through the rear window of his patrol car as he responded to an emergency call at a housing estate, the police said.\nWithin 12 hours, responsibility for the attack had been claimed by the Continuity I.R.A., one of three main dissident factions opposed to the peace process in the province and committed to violence as a means of promoting the republicans\u2019 goal of a unified Ireland. The police in Craigavon said Tuesday that they had arrested two men, a 17-year-old and a 37-year-old, in connection with the shooting.\nResponsibility for the attack that killed the soldiers as they were collecting pizzas at the gates of an army base on Saturday night in Antrim, 15 miles northwest of Belfast, was claimed by the Real I.R.A., a larger group than the Continuity I.R.A., but part of what police intelligence officials say is a loosely coordinated network that has gunmen moving between the groups and cooperating in some attacks. Members of the groups are mostly drawn from the mainstream I.R.A. and its hard-line offshoot, the so-called Provisionals, who were the main republican strike force during the 30 years of sectarian violence known here euphemistically as the Troubles.\nPoliticians on both sides of the divide between the Protestant and Roman Catholic communities in the province denounced the killing as the work of \u201cterrorists,\u201d and called on anyone with knowledge of the killers to step forward and help the police, despite the deep mistrust for the force that lingers among Catholics from the past, when the police were widely regarded as allies of the Protestants.\nWith three members of the security forces killed in less than 48 hours, there were fears that the fragile peace that culminated with the establishment of a power-sharing government in May 2007 might be at risk.\nThe reaction in Craigavon, on one of the main roads from Belfast to the border with the Irish republic, suggested that for now, those concerns might be overblown. The town, in the county of Armagh, a major sectarian battlefield in the past, has a mixed population of Catholics and Protestants, but people approached at random at the site of the shooting and in shopping malls seemed confident that the peace would survive the shootings.\nA 25-year-old Catholic man who gave his name only as William said that he supported Sinn Fein, the main nationalist party in the power-sharing government, and that he \u201cfeared something like this was going to happen\u201d when I.R.A. sentiment split over the peace agreement. \u201cThere is still a small minority out there who agree with shootings and all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with it myself. There was a time when I may have agreed with it. But it is the wrong time. Violence is in the past.\u201d\nThe killing in Craigavon was the first time that a police officer had died from a politically motivated attack since the old Royal Ulster Constabulary was reformed in 2001 and renamed the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The force has been sharply reduced in size, shorn of a paramilitary wing known as the \u201cspecials\u201d and set on a course to even out a recruitment policy that for decades had favored Protestants over Catholics.\nDolores Kelly, a moderate Catholic politician on the province\u2019s policing board, who is a former mayor of Craigavon, called on politicians of all parties to avoid exacerbating the tensions. She said it was vital that efforts to tighten security across the province not include, as some Protestant politicians have urged, the recall to the province of British Army units that played a major part in tracking down and killing I.R.A. members in the past.\nLeaders of Sinn Fein, the predominantly Catholic party with historical links to the I.R.A. that is a principal partner in the power-sharing government, have said that the trigger for the killings of the soldiers and the policeman may have been an action last week by Sir Hugh Orde, the province\u2019s police chief. About 48 hours before the attack in Antrim, he had asked the army to deploy \u201csmall numbers\u201d of its Special Reconnaissance Regiment \u2014 an undercover intelligence unit \u2014 into the province from the unit\u2019s base in mainland Britain.\nThe police chief said he needed help in containing an intensifying security threat from the dissident republicans, who had staged more than 20 gun and bomb attacks on police targets in the past 18 months, wounding seven officers but causing no fatalities. The dissidents were also identified by the police as responsible for a planned car-bomb attack on an army base last month, which was averted when the police found and defused the 300 pounds of explosives wired into the vehicle ahead of the attack.\n\u201cA heavy-handed security response is just what the dissident republicans are hoping for,\u201d Ms. Kelly, the policing board member, said. She said the gunmen and the men who planned their attacks \u201cwant to see British troops back on the streets, they want to see draconian measures taken by the authorities,\u201d in the belief that the return of army units would tip opinion within the Catholic community against the power-sharing accord, just as support for the accord has been shaken among Protestants by the latest killings. \u201cI would appeal to people to pull back,\u201d Ms. Kelly said.\nSimilar appeals came from across the political spectrum in the province, and from London, where the British government was holding emergency meetings to consider developments in the province. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who visited the Antrim army barracks on Monday to pay his respects, responded to the policeman\u2019s killing with a new call for calm.\n\u201cI know the people of Northern Ireland, they want the political process to move forward,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThey do not want a return to guns in the street.\u201d\nA major concern in London has been that Protestant militants might respond to the killings in Antrim and Craigavon with retaliatory killings of their own, setting off a new cycle of violence that would shatter the power-sharing government. That concern appeared to be shared by Sinn Fein leaders, particularly Gerry Adams, the party\u2019s president, and Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister in the Belfast government, who are both former I.R.A. commanders.\nThe men have been condemned by some Protestant leaders and by newspaper editorials in Britain for the carefully measured terms in which they condemned the soldiers\u2019 killings. Mr. Adams refused to describe the shootings as \u201cmurders\u201d under questioning by reporters and compared the grief of the soldiers\u2019 families to the suffering of bereaved Catholic families in the past.\nAfter the policeman\u2019s killing, Mr. McGuinness called on \u201call the people\u201d of the province to assist the police in tracking down the gunmen. He called the men who carried out the three killings \u201ctraitors to the island of Ireland.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/europe/11ireland.html", "title": "After Killings Linked to I.R.A.

{"date": "Sat, 19 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "COPENHAGEN \u2014 Connie Hedegaard, Denmark\u2019s minister of climate and energy, feels little kinship with the green end of the political spectrum \u2014 people who stage sit-ins at power plants or vote for the Green parties in elections.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never understood why the environment should be a left-wing issue,\u201d said Ms. Hedegaard, with an exasperated sigh. \u201cIn my view there is nothing as core to conservative beliefs \u2014 that what you inherit you should pass on to the next generation.\u201d\nDenmark \u2014 and Ms. Hedegaard \u2014 will play host in December to hundreds of nations that will gather in Copenhagen for the United Nation-sponsored global climate treaty negotiations. The meetings are tasked with finalizing a new global plan to tackle climate change. Ms. Hedegaard, who two years ago offered her city as the site for the negotiations, will be the president and the chairwoman of the 12-day event.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very important job,\u201d said John Hay, a spokesman for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, noting that the president of the climate meeting is the one who \u201chammers through the deal.\u201d\nMs. Hedegaard, he said, \u201cfully appreciates that role and is taking it very seriously.\u201d The placement of Ms. Hedegaard, a lifelong conservative, at the center of the preparations reflects in large part the shifting of global environmental issues from the fringe into the political mainstream. A movement whose symbols were fuzzy endangered animals is now more concerned with oil futures and budget sheets.\nUnlike Germany, the Netherlands and France, Denmark has never had a Green party, Ms. Hedegaard points out. In fact, she said, she sees herself as an environmentalist in the model of Theodore Roosevelt, a lifelong hunter who campaigned ardently for protecting natural resources.\n\u201cPeople say environment is a soft issue, but it\u2019s not,\u201d she said recently, sitting in her spartan office in a pink sweater and neatly pressed slacks. \u201cIt\u2019s about where we get our energy from, about security, about growing economies. I\u2019m a conservative, I worry about that.\u201d\nBlunt and no-nonsense, Ms. Hedegaard, 49, has already emerged as a producer, director, arm-twister, therapist and matchmaker for the Copenhagen meetings \u2014 Time magazine this week named her one of the world\u2019s 100 most influential people.\nIn preparation for the December meetings, she is promoting her goals via Twitter and a blog. And though she does not have any official position until the conference opens on Dec. 8, she has spent the last year crisscrossing the globe \u2014 in the last few months alone, she has visited Brazil, India, China, the United States, Mexico and a number of African nations \u2014 urging reluctant countries to pony up and do their share to combat climate change.\nMs. Hedegaard arrived in Washington on Wednesday to attend the Major Economies Forum on Climate Change and to meet with officials in preparation for the Group of 20 summit meeting in Pittsburgh this week. She will then travel to New York for a climate summit meeting convened by the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on Monday. The Danes, who have been hyperkinetically anticipating the December meetings, are holding their own \u201cpre-summit\u201d of environmental ministers just outside New York City this weekend.\nLong viewed as something of a wunderkind, Ms Hedegaard was the youngest member of Parliament in Danish history when she was elected in 1984, at age 25. She left politics in 1990 and spent 15 years as a columnist and anchorwoman for Denmark\u2019s top news outlets, then returned to government in 2004 as the nation\u2019s environment minister.\nAlthough the United Nations has held a big climate meeting each year since 1995, December\u2019s gathering is extraordinary for many reasons. The emissions reduction commitments that countries made under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol expire in 2012. And while the Bush administration was seen by many countries as an obstacle to achieving a global accord, President Obama has declared that he wants to be a leader in environment issues.\nMs. Hedegaard views the moment as an opportunity that must be seized.\n\u201cOur contribution has been to try to get the parties together before it\u2019s too late,\u201d she said.\nStill, hers is a kind of tough-love approach and, like Teddy Roosevelt, she has used her bully pulpit to be extraordinarily blunt about the kinds of concessions she expects, \u201cputting pressure on all governments to make the political price of being an obstacle so high that no one will pay it,\u201d she said.\nFor example, Ms. Hedegaard has expressed impatience with the United States, which has focused on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the lead heat-trapping gas linked to global warming, by 2050, but has been far less clear about what it intends to do by 2020.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather crucial that the U.S. can show a credible pathway, and the sooner we get started the more realistic it will be to achieve a goal,\u201d Ms. Hedegaard said. \u201cIf we postpone, then we\u2019ll have such a steep path that it may be hard or impossible to achieve.\u201d\nShe is quick to point out that the United States emits twice as much carbon dioxide per capita as Denmark, without gaining anything in quality of life.\nMs. Hedegaard would also like fast-developing countries like India and \u2014 especially \u2014 China to commit in some way to limiting their emissions, noting that by 2020 two-thirds of emissions will come from countries now considered developing nations.\n\u201cChina and other emerging nations must accept it even if it isn\u2019t fair,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI get it. If I were a developing country I would say, \u2018Why should I do this?\u2019 They are feeling the consequences of climate change first and foremost. And they didn\u2019t create the situation.\u201d\nBut, she said, \u201cit\u2019s just an arithmetic fact that if China and India continue at the current rate they\u2019ll use up the whole global carbon space in a very short time.\u201d\nMs. Hedegaard\u2019s no-nonsense style has raised some hackles, and some United Nations officials have said they worry that developing nations might feel strong-armed by her pronouncements, since she is supposed to be a neutral host and is not a negotiator. But some negotiators say they are grateful for the Danish efforts.\n\u201cIt is entirely appropriate,\u201d said Todd Stern, lead negotiator for the United States. \u201cConnie is working hard, as is the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201d\nGood or bad, any climate agreement that comes out of the December meeting will bear Copenhagen\u2019s name. And the tenor of the meetings is likely to reflect Denmark\u2019s sober brand of environmentalism. The government has proposed new fines to keep activists in check during the meetings \u2014 $2,000 for breaking through a police cordon or wearing a mask during demonstrations\u2014 and the penalties have angered grass-roots groups.\nBut the conference, in the end, is not about Denmark, Ms. Hedegaard said.\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re investing a huge amount in hosting this event and we\u2019re working hard for a success,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Denmark doesn\u2019t decide that. The major economies will decide whether it works or not.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/world/europe/20denmark.html", "title": "Danish Conservative Prepares for Climate Debate", "author": "ELISABETH ROSENTHAL"}
{"date": "Fri, 12 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TEHRAN \u2014 Iran\u2019s state-run news agency said Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had won Iran\u2019s presidential election in a landslide just two hours after the polls closed Friday night. But his main rival, Mir Hussein Moussavi, announced defiantly that he had won and charged that there had been voting \u201cirregularities.\u201d\n\u201cI am the absolute winner of the election by a very large margin,\u201d Mr. Moussavi said during a news conference with reporters just after 11 p.m. Friday, adding: \u201cIt is our duty to defend people\u2019s votes. There is no turning back.\u201d\nThe conflicting claims, coming after an extraordinary campaign that saw vast street demonstrations and vitriolic televised debates, seemed to undermine the public legitimacy of the vote and to threaten unrest.\nIn recent days, Mr. Moussavi\u2019s supporters were predicting a wide victory, citing voter surveys. And Mr. Ahmadinejad, the hard-line incumbent, had appeared on the defensive, hurling extraordinary accusations at some of the Islamic republic\u2019s founding figures.\nAn hour after Mr. Moussavi declared victory, the state news agency reported that Mr. Ahmadinejad had won the election with 69 percent and that Mr. Moussavi had 28 percent. As the election commission announced new totals early Saturday morning, the numbers changed slightly, but the wide lead by Mr. Ahmadinejad did not.\nThe election commission said early Saturday morning that, with 77 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Ahmadinejad had won 65 percent and Mr. Moussavi had 32 percent, Reuters reported. Then at 8 a.m. Saturday, Iranian state media reported that Mr. Ahmadinejad had about 18 million votes and that Mr. Moussavi had 9 million. The other two candidates, Mehdi Karroubi and Mohsen Rezai, each won about 250,000 votes, the state media reported.\nThe election commission is part of the Interior Ministry, which Mr. Ahmadinejad controls. Some lawmakers were already congratulating Mr. Ahmadinejad, and some of his supporters were celebrating in the streets, the news agency said.\nSome analysts warned that Mr. Moussavi\u2019s supporters might take to the streets to protest on Saturday, despite a firm warning against any demonstrations by the deputy commander of the Iranian national police, Ahmadreza Radan. Early on Saturday morning the Tehran police began a \u201cmaneuver\u201d to maintain security, the news agency said.\nThe emotional campaign was widely seen as a referendum on Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s divisive policies. It pitted Mr. Moussavi, a former prime minister who has pledged to move Iran away from confrontation with the West, combat economic stagnation and expand women\u2019s rights, against Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s economic populism, social conservatism, and hard-line foreign policy.\nMany women, young people, intellectuals and members of the moderate clerical establishment backed Mr. Moussavi. Mr. Ahmadinejad drew passionate support from poor rural Iranians as well as conservatives.\nAt his news conference, Mr. Moussavi cited irregularities that included a shortage of ballots. He accused the government of shutting down Web sites, newspapers and text messaging services throughout the country, crippling the opposition\u2019s ability to communicate during the voting.\nFraud has been a prominent concern for Mr. Moussavi\u2019s campaign, with many of his allies warning that Mr. Ahmadinejad could use the levers of state \u2014 the military, the Revolutionary Guard, and the Basij militia \u2014 to cajole or intimidate voters, or even engage in outright fraud. In 2005, Mr. Karroubi, who is also a candidate in this election, accused the Basij of rigging the vote in Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s favor.\nAt his news conference, Mr. Moussavi called on the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to help the country reach a \u201cfavorable conclusion.\u201d\nAyatollah Khamenei, who has final authority over affairs of state, appears to be the only figure who could mediate between the two camps in the event of an open confrontation over the legitimacy of the vote. But it is not clear how much he knows about the crisis, or what role he might play.\nMr. Khamenei met on Friday with Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a cleric, former president and backer of Mr. Moussavi\u2019s who had warned the supreme leader in an unusual open letter on Tuesday about the possibility of election fraud, according to a political analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the gravity of the situation.\nWhile casting his ballot earlier in the day Friday, Ayatollah Khamenei had said that people were using texting to spread rumors, but it is unclear if that is why the services were shut down.\nAmid the confusion overnight, a reformist Web site called Fararu said Mr. Moussavi was talking with the two other candidates, Mr. Karroubi and Mr. Rezai, to discuss the situation. Mr. Karroubi is a reformist cleric and Mr. Rezai is a conservative and the former commander of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards.\nTens of millions of Iranians crowded voting stations throughout the day, with long lines forming outside some polling stations well before they opened at 8 a.m.\nPolls were originally due to close at 6 p.m., but voting was extended by four hours.\nThe strong showing appeared to be driven in part by a broad movement against Mr. Ahmadinejad that has spurred vast opposition rallies in Iran\u2019s major cities over the past few weeks. Many reform-oriented voters stayed away from the polls in 2005, and now say they are determined not to repeat the mistake.\nAccording to Iran\u2019s election rules, if none of the candidates wins more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two finishers will compete in a runoff in a week. Most analysts had assumed that the election would go to a second round, but in recent days, the extraordinary public support for Mr. Moussavi had led to predictions that he could win the presidency in the first round on Friday.\nIran\u2019s president is less powerful than Ayatollah Khamenei, who has final authority over affairs of state. But the president wields great power over domestic affairs, and Mr. Ahmadinejad has skillfully used the office as a bully pulpit both at home and abroad.\nAs voting began on Friday morning, journalists gathered to watch Ayatollah Khamenei cast his vote in a mosque near his home in southern Tehran. Just after 8 a.m., a set of brown curtains opened and the leader emerged, a gaunt 69-year-old with glasses and a long white beard, with a black turban on his head and a black clerical gown draped around him. The journalists, mostly Iranians, gasped and then chanted a religious blessing.\nThe supreme leader presented his identity papers to an official standing nearby, cast his ballots and then gave a brief speech in which he praised the vigor of the election campaign.\n\u201cI am hearing about a vast participation of people, and I hear there are even gatherings at night,\u201d the ayatollah said. \u201cThis shows the people\u2019s awareness.\u201d\nAyatollah Khamenei\u2019s position on the presidential elections has been a matter of intense speculation. He has not endorsed anyone, but offered a description of the ideal candidate that sounded very much like Mr. Ahmadinejad.\nA number of voters seemed anxious about the possibility of vote-tampering.\n\u201cI put one name in, but maybe it will change when it comes out of the box,\u201d said Adel Shoghi, 29, who works as a clerk at a car manufacturing company and voted at a mosque in southern Tehran.\nLike some other supporters of Mr. Moussavi, Mr. Shoghi seemed uneasy about making his position too explicit in public. But he said he favored Mr. Moussavi because Iran needed more civic freedoms and because Mr. Ahmadinejad worsened Iran\u2019s pariah status internationally, making life hard for Iranians who travel.\nHis brother Mansoor, 27, said he had just voted for Mr. Ahmadinejad.\n\u201cHe is more with the people, and he has a plain way of living,\u201d he said, echoing comments made by many of his supporters.\nHalf an hour later, Mr. Moussavi arrived at the mosque to cast his vote, surrounded by a thick, shouting crowd of aides and photographers.\n\u201cThis is a golden opportunity for us,\u201d he said, as photographers jostled for position and voters struggled to hear. \u201cAll this unity and solidarity is the achievement of the revolution and the Islamic republic,\u201d he said.\nHe left soon after, with his admirers in the courtyard still chanting, \u201cHail to Muhammad, the perfume of honesty and sincerity is coming.\u201d\nMr. Ahmadinejad voted at another mosque, in southeast Tehran.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/world/middleeast/13iran.html", "title": "Both Sides Claim Victory in Presidential Election in Iran", "author": "ROBERT F.

{"date": "Fri, 13 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 For a brief moment, it looked as if civil war would break out on campus. Two clusters of excited young people faced off as the student election results came in: Hezbollah allies on one side, and right-wing Christian zealots on the other.\n\u201cAbu Hadi!\u201d shouted one group in unison, the students pumping their fists furiously in the air as they swore loyalty to Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah.\n\u201cHakim!\u201d chanted the other side, using a name for the Christian leader and former warlord Samir Geagea.\nThe voices grew louder and angrier, and then it began: bottles flying, men throwing punches, women screaming. Once again, St. Joseph University \u2014 one of Lebanon\u2019s best and oldest schools \u2014 had become a reflection in miniature of the country\u2019s fiercely divided political scene.\nStudent council elections in Lebanon have long been almost as tense as the real elections in Parliament. The results are seen as crucial indexes of a party\u2019s overall popularity and routinely make the front pages of national newspapers. University administrators have struggled to ban the parties and put the focus on academic issues, with little success.\n\u201cIt means a lot; it\u2019s my cause,\u201d said Jenny Tohme, 21, a law student at St. Joseph who supports Michel Aoun, the Christian leader allied with Hezbollah. \u201cIf you live here, you have to be committed to a party, because unfortunately there is no place for independent people in Lebanon.\u201d\nSome hopeful commentators have suggested in recent years that a silent majority of young people across the Arab world are fed up with the cults of personality and sectarian agendas that have long dominated politics here. But there is little sign of that on Lebanese campuses.\nIn part, this is because the parties put tremendous energy into recruiting the young, paying for workshops and social events, and nurturing youths as future leaders. But Lebanon\u2019s campuses are not merely passive reflections of the adult political scene. Like their counterparts in Europe, they have sometimes served as political laboratories, where ideas and trends circulate before spreading to the wider world.\nThis was true in the 1960s and \u201970s at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon\u2019s largest and best-known campus, where support flourished for the Palestinians and various leftist causes and parties.\nIt was also true during the 1990s, when universities provided a sanctuary for anti-Syrian activism that was impossible elsewhere. The broader popular movement to free Lebanon from Syrian control \u2014 which reached its peak in the vast Beirut demonstrations of early spring 2005, and effectively forced the Syrians to withdraw \u2014 originated in part among students.\n\u201cAt times student movements have shaped, even led, the direction of elite politics,\u201d said Elinor Bray-Collins, who wrote a Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Toronto on Lebanese student movements. \u201cBut the autonomy student politics sometimes acquires is short-lived; the adults take over, and it gets swept back into the same sectarian logic.\u201d\nLebanon\u2019s divisions are no longer as linear as they once were. The Shiites of Hezbollah now have Christian allies, as do the Sunnis on the other side. But the loyalties often seem as unthinkingly partisan as ever, both in Parliament and on campus.\n\u201cThe students are all brainwashed,\u201d said Fuad Obeid, 19, a law student at St. Joseph, as he stood discontentedly watching fellow students vote on delegates last week. \u201cThere isn\u2019t even any political or economic substance, no plan for the country. The only thing they can bring us to is blood.\u201d\nLast year was a low point, with tensions so high that one major university canceled its student elections altogether. At St. Joseph, fights broke out after the party of Mr. Aoun won by one vote, and several students were expelled. Afterward, Aounist students ran riot in the streets of East Beirut\u2019s Christian areas, chanting slogans, honking their car horns and carrying the giant orange flags of their party.\nThis year, it was the administrators who offered new ideas. St. Joseph changed to a system of proportional representation in the student elections, in an effort to calm things down and better represent a diversity of opinion. Civic-minded reformers have been urging the same idea for Parliament for years, for the same reason. Some newspapers praised the move, noting sadly that the university had achieved what the country could not.\n\u201cWe faced two choices: to suppress the elections, or try to guide the tensions, to create a path that favors dialogue,\u201d said Henri Awit, the vice dean of student affairs at St. Joseph. \u201cWhat matters most is that both sides recognize the importance of independent voices.\u201d\nThe change served its purpose in part. Both sides claimed victory after the Nov. 3 vote because the new system made it harder to tally vote totals. But many say the intense partisan atmosphere has not really changed.\n\u201cPolitics is the bread of the people in this country,\u201d said Samir Ashi, the director of the youth outreach sector of the Future Movement, the party of the new prime minister, Saad Hariri. \u201cEven elementary school children get into fights over politics.\u201d\nLike every major Lebanese political party, the Future Movement runs an elaborate effort to engage young people, Mr. Ashi said, with a 30-member youth steering committee, five fully staffed offices and 500 members of campus youth committees.\nBy the time first-year students arrive on campus, the parties already have lists identifying them and their religious backgrounds, said Layal Yacoub, a 19-year-old law student at St. Joseph. \u201cThey surround you, help you, give you advice,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they help with scholarships.\u201d\nOfficially, the parties are not allowed any presence on campus, and the elections are supposed to be run on academic issues like whether students\u2019 grades should be publicly posted, Ms. Yacoub said. But that is just a fig leaf. Everyone knows who stands with which party. And the independent students who run with known party figures are called \u201ckamikazes,\u201d because they cannot win.\n\u201cI am voting for someone because I think he\u2019s competent,\u201d Ms. Yacoub said, adjusting her glasses. \u201cThere are people here who have political views, but who think the university should be a place for academic issues only.\u201d\nBut she added resignedly: \u201cIt always turns into a political fight. You just can\u2019t get rid of it.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/world/middleeast/14lebanon.html", "title": "Campus Elections in Lebanon Mirror Society\u2019s Politics", "author": "ROBERT F.

{"date": "Wed, 04 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CAIRO \u2014 Even in old age the imposingly tall, athletic German known to locals as Tarek Hussein Farid maintained the discipline to walk some 15 miles each day through the busy streets of Egypt\u2019s capital. He walked to the world-renowned Al Azhar mosque here, where he converted to Islam, and to the ornate J. Groppi Cafe downtown, where he ordered the chocolate cakes he sent to friends and bought the bonbons he gave to their children, who called him Uncle Tarek.\nFriends and acquaintances here in Egypt also remember him as an avid amateur photographer who almost always wore a camera around his neck, but never allowed himself to be photographed. And with good reason: Uncle Tarek was born Aribert Ferdinand Heim, a member of Hitler\u2019s elite Waffen-SS and a medical doctor at the Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen and Mauthausen concentration camps.\nIt was behind the gray stone walls of Mauthausen, in his native Austria, that Dr. Heim committed the atrocities against hundreds of Jews and others that earned him the nickname Dr. Death and his status as the most wanted Nazi war criminal still believed by the Simon Wiesenthal Center to be at large.\nDr. Heim was accused of performing operations on prisoners without anesthesia; removing organs from healthy inmates, then leaving them to die on the operating table; injecting poison, including gasoline, into the hearts of others; and taking the skull of at least one victim as a souvenir. After living below the radar of Nazi hunters for more than a decade after World War II \u2014 much of it in the German spa town of Baden-Baden where he had a wife, two sons and a medical practice as a gynecologist \u2014 he escaped capture just as investigators closed in on him in 1962.\nHis hiding place, as well as his death in 1992, have remained unknown until now.\nInvestigators in Israel and Germany have repeatedly said that they believed Dr. Heim was alive and hiding in Latin America, near where a woman alleged to be his illegitimate daughter lived in Chile. Witnesses from Finland to Vietnam and from Saudi Arabia to Argentina have sent tips and reported sightings to investigators.\nA dusty briefcase with rusted buckles, sitting nearly forgotten in storage here in Cairo, hid the truth behind Dr. Heim\u2019s flight to the Middle East. Obtained by The New York Times and the German television station ZDF from members of the Doma family, proprietors of the hotel here where Dr. Heim resided, the files in the briefcase tell the story of his life, and death, in Egypt.\nThe briefcase contains an archive of yellowed pages, some in envelopes that were still sealed, of Dr. Heim\u2019s letters and medical test results, his financial records and an underlined, annotated article from a German magazine about his own manhunt and trial in absentia, even drawings of soldiers and trains by the children he left behind in Germany. Some documents are in the name Heim, others Farid, but many of the latter, like an application for Egyptian residency under the name Tarek Hussein Farid, have the same birthday, June 28, 1914, and the same place of birth, Radkersburg, Austria, as Dr. Heim.\nAlthough none of the 10 friends and acquaintances in Cairo who identified a photograph of Dr. Heim knew his real identity, they described signs that he might have been on the run. \u201cMy idea, which I\u2019ve taken from my father at that time, is that he was in dispute with maybe the Jews, but he took refuge in Cairo at that time,\u201d said Tarek Abdelmoneim el Rifai, the son of Abdelmoneim el Rifai, 88, Dr. Heim\u2019s dentist in Cairo and close friend.\nA certified copy of a death certificate obtained from Egyptian authorities confirmed witness accounts that the man called Tarek Hussein Farid died in 1992. \u201cTarek Hussein Farid is the name my father took when he converted to Islam,\u201d said his son R\u00fcdiger Heim. In an interview in the family\u2019s villa in Baden-Baden, Mr. Heim, 53, admitted publicly for the first time that he was with his father in Egypt at the time of his death from rectal cancer.\n\u201cIt was during the Olympics. There was a television in the room, and he was watching the Olympics. It distracted him. He must have been suffering from serious pain,\u201d said Mr. Heim, who is tall, like his father, with a long mournful face and speaks softly and carefully. Dr. Aribert Heim died the day after the Games ended, on Aug. 10, 1992, according to his son and the death certificate.\nMr. Heim said he learned of his father\u2019s whereabouts through his aunt, who has since died. He said he did not come forward because he did not wish to bring trouble to any of his father\u2019s friends in Egypt. As the number of surviving Nazi war criminals has dwindled, his father\u2019s case has grown in prominence.\nShelter in the Middle East\nDespite the newly uncovered evidence of Dr. Heim\u2019s time in Egypt, it is impossible to definitively close his case, with the location of his burial site still a mystery.\nHis death would be a significant but hitherto unknown milestone in the winding up of the passionate and at times controversial hunt for Nazi war criminals that led to the trial and execution of the Holocaust planner Adolf Eichmann but never managed to catch up with Josef Mengele, the most famous of the Nazi doctors, who died in Brazil in 1979, as forensic tests later proved.\nWhile the secret lives of Nazis in countries like Argentina and Paraguay captured the popular imagination in books and films like \u201cThe Odessa File\u201d and \u201cThe Boys From Brazil,\u201d the Heim case casts light on the often overlooked history of their flight to the Middle East.\nUntil political winds shifted, ex-Nazis were welcomed in Egypt in the years after World War II, helping in particular with military technology. R\u00fcdiger Heim said that his father told him he knew other Nazis there, but tried to steer clear of them.\nEven so, how Dr. Heim was able to elude his pursuers for so long, while receiving money from Europe, most notably from his late sister, Herta Barth, and corresponding with friends and family in long letters, is unclear.\n\u201cThe Arab world was an even better, a safer haven than South America,\u201d said Efraim Zuroff, the Israel director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, who had been searching for Dr. Heim and traveled to Chile last July to raise awareness about the case. Mr. Zuroff expressed surprise when informed of Dr. Heim\u2019s apparent fate, saying the center had been about to raise the reward for information leading to his arrest to $1.3 million from $400,000.\nA Trail Gone Cold\nThe only time Dr. Heim was ever jailed was after World War II when he was held by the American military in Germany. But the military released him, apparently unaware that investigators in Austria were building a case against him. A United States war crimes team took testimony about his crimes from Josef Kohl, a former inmate at Mauthausen, on Jan. 18, 1946, less than a year after the German surrender.\n\u201cDr. Heim had a habit of looking into inmates\u2019 mouths to determine whether their teeth were in impeccable condition,\u201d Mr. Kohl said, according to a transcript of the interview. \u201cIf this were the case, he would kill the prisoner with an injection, cut his head off, leave it to cook in the crematorium for hours, until all the flesh was stripped from the naked skull, and prepare the skull for himself and his friends as a decoration for their desks.\u201d\nMr. Zuroff said that because Dr. Heim was at Mauthausen for a short time early in the war, in the fall of 1941, he was \u201caware of no people alive today who suffered at his hands and can give first-hand testimony of his crimes.\u201d\nGerman investigators said that Dr. Heim was careful throughout the postwar period when less-controlled people might have let down their guard.\nInvestigators noted that Dr. Heim, a talented ice hockey player, stayed out of pictures when his hockey team posed for its group portrait, even after they won the German championship. Dr. Heim owned an apartment building in Berlin, which investigators said for years provided him with income for his life incognito.\nAt the headquarters of the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state police in Stuttgart today, small magnets freckle a map of the world, marking the spots where clues or reports of sightings surfaced. Investigators said that they had searched continuously since his disappearance in 1962, checking more than 240 leads and ruling out several people thought to be Dr. Heim. While they never caught him, they appear to have come tantalizingly close to his hiding place in the Middle East.\n\u201cThere was information that Heim was in Egypt working as a police doctor between 1967 and the beginning of the \u201970s,\u201d said Joachim Sch\u00e4ck, head of the fugitive unit at the state police. \u201cThis lead proved to be false.\u201d\nAccording to his son, Dr. Heim had left Germany and driven through France and Spain before crossing into Morocco, and eventually settling in Egypt. \u201cIt was only sheer coincidence that the police could not arrest me because I was not at home at the time,\u201d Dr. Heim wrote in a letter to the German magazine Spiegel, after it published a report about his war-crimes case in 1979. It is unclear whether he ever sent the letter, which was found in his files, many of which were written in meticulous cursive style in German or English.\nIn the letter he also accused Simon Wiesenthal, who was interned at Mauthausen, of being \u201cthe one who invented these atrocities.\u201d Dr. Heim went on to discuss what he called Israeli massacres of Palestinians, and added that \u201cthe Jewish Khazar, Zionist lobby of the U.S. were the first ones who in 1933 declared war against Hitler\u2019s Germany.\u201d\nThe Turkic ethnic group the Khazars were a recurring theme for Dr. Heim, who kept himself busy in Cairo, researching a paper he wrote in English and German, decrying the possibility of anti-Semitism owing to the fact, he said, that most Jews were not Semitic in ethnic origin. Mr. Rifai recalled that Dr. Heim had shown his family many different drafts of the paper, which were among the papers found in the briefcase that The Times and ZDF television obtained. A list also showed plans to send drafts of the paper to prominent people around the world \u2014 under the name Dr. Youssef Ibrahim \u2014 including the United Nations secretary general, Kurt Waldheim, the United States national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and Yugoslavia\u2019s leader, Marshal Tito.\nLife as Uncle Tarek\nHe formed close bonds with his neighbors, including the Doma family, which ran the Kasr el Madina hotel, where Dr. Heim lived the last decade before his death. Mahmoud Doma, whose father owned the establishment, said Dr. Heim spoke Arabic, English and French, in addition to German. Mr. Doma said his neighbor read and studied the Koran, including a copy in German that the Domas had ordered for him.\nMr. Doma, 38, became emotional when talking about the man he knew as Uncle Tarek, whom he said gave him books and encouraged him to study. \u201cHe was like a father. He loved me and I loved him.\u201d\nHe recalled how Uncle Tarek bought rackets and set up a tennis net on the hotel roof, where he and his siblings played with the German Muslim until sundown. But by 1990, Dr. Heim\u2019s good health began to fail him and his illness was diagnosed as cancer.\nAfter his death, his son R\u00fcdiger insisted that they follow his father\u2019s wishes and donate the body to science, not an easy task in a Muslim country where the rules dictate a swift burial and dissection is opposed. Mr. Doma, who wanted to put Uncle Tarek in the family crypt next to his father, opposed the plan.\nThe two men rode in a white van with the body of Dr. Heim, which had been washed and wrapped in a white sheet in accordance with Muslim tradition and placed in a wooden coffin. Mr. Doma said they bribed a hospital functionary to take the body, but Egyptian authorities found out, and Dr. Heim was instead interred in a common grave, anonymously.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/world/africa/05nazi.html", "title": "Uncovering Lost Path of the Most Wanted Nazi", "author": "SOUAD MEKHENNET and NICHOLAS KULISH"}

Putin said Sunday that the planned \u201creset\u201d in relations between Russia and the United States had been hampered by NATO exercises in Georgia, and that he hoped the United States would \u201cstep on the brake hard\u201d to prevent the relationship from deteriorating.\nIn an interview with Japanese news services before a visit to Tokyo, Mr. Putin also said negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons should be linked to changes in the United States\u2019 planned missile-defense system. Russia has long complained that proposed missile-defense facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic would pose a threat to Russia, and Mr. Putin said offensive and defensive capacities were \u201cinseparably bound up.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be an expert to see that if one side wants to or has an umbrella against various threats, it can begin to suffer from the illusion that it is permissible to do whatever it likes, and then its actions will become many times more aggressive and the threat of a global confrontation will reach a danger level,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRussia will, of course, link the issues of missile defense and everything related to it with strategic offensive weapons,\u201d he said. He went on to say that Russia was encouraged by the United States\u2019 disarmament agenda and was ready to begin talks about replacing the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or Start, which expires in December.\nMr. Putin emphasized that the \u201creset,\u201d a term used by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., was a United States initiative rather than a Russian one. He said that Russia welcomed the overture, but that the military exercises in Georgia that began last week were \u201ca signal in a different direction\u201d and a show of support for President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia. He went on to characterize Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s government as undemocratic, citing a clash between the police and protesters and a brief military mutiny in Georgia last week.\n\u201cWe believe this is a step backward,\u201d he said of the exercises, run by NATO\u2019s Partnership for Peace program, which includes nations that are not members of the alliance. \u201cBut we understand that it takes time for brakes to take effect. We very much hope that the current U.S. leadership will step on the brake hard and slow down the negative trends in the development of links between our states.\u201d\nHe also said he and President Dmitri A. Medvedev had not yet decided which posts they would seek when Mr. Medvedev\u2019s term expires in 2012. Mr. Putin was constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive presidential term last year but could run again in 2012. He said the decision would center on their handling of the financial crisis.\n\u201cBoth President Medvedev and I will decide what we will do \u2014 both he and I \u2014 depending on the results of our work,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for him personally, you should ask him, but I repeat, I have known him for a long time and I know that he is a very decent man and he will look at his political future proceeding from the interest of the country and the results of our joint efforts.

{"date": "Sun, 19 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ORANGE FARM, South Africa \u2014 Young men have flocked by the thousands to this clinic for circumcisions, the only one of its kind in South Africa. Each of them lies down on one of seven closely spaced surgical tables, his privacy shielded only by a green curtain.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done 53 in a seven-hour day, me, myself, personally,\u201d said Dr. Dino Rech, who helped design the highly efficient surgical assembly line at this French-financed clinic for cutting off foreskins.\nCircumcision has been proven to reduce a man\u2019s risk of contracting H.I.V. by more than half. Yet two years after the World Health Organization recommended the surgery, the government here still does not provide it to help fight the disease or educate the public about its benefits.\nSome other African nations are championing the procedure and bringing it to thousands. But in South Africa, the powerhouse country at the heart of the epidemic, the government has been notably silent, despite the withering international criticism the country has endured for its previous foot-dragging in fighting and treating AIDS.\n\u201cCountries around us with fewer resources, both human and financial, are able to achieve more,\u201d said Dr. Quarraisha Abdool Karim, the first director of South Africa\u2019s national AIDS program in the mid-1990s under President Nelson Mandela. \u201cI wish I understood why South Africa, which has an enviable amount of resources, is not able to respond to the epidemic the way Botswana and Kenya have.\u201d\nEven without government involvement, demand for the surgery, performed free under local anesthetic, has surged over the last year here at the Orange Farm clinic. The men are counseled to continue using condoms since circumcision provides partial, though substantial protection.\nMen waited nervously one recent chilly morning for their turn. Most were hoping the procedure would help them stay healthy here in the nation with more H.I.V.-positive people than any other.\nBut some said they were also drawn by a surprising, if powerful, motivation: They had heard from recently circumcised friends that it makes for better sex. You last longer, they said. Your lovers think you\u2019re cleaner and more exciting in bed.\n\u201cMy girlfriend was nagging me about this,\u201d said Shane Koapeng, 24. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018O.K., let me do it.\u2019 \u201d\nAs new H.I.V. infections have continued to outpace efforts to treat the sick in Africa, there is growing concern about the ballooning costs of treatment for an ever-expanding number of patients who need medicines for the rest of their lives. Almost two million people were newly infected in 2007 in sub-Saharan Africa, bringing the total of those living with H.I.V. in the region to 22 million, according to United Nations estimates.\nThe major international donors to AIDS programs, including the United States and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, are ready to pour money into male circumcision, but the countries have to be ready to accept the help.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t impose it from the outside, particularly such a sensitive intervention,\u201d said the Global Fund\u2019s executive director, Dr. Michel Kazatchkine.\nPublic health doctors agree that circumcising millions of men will be no simple task. Africa has a severe shortage of doctors and nurses, and circumcision is potentially a political and cultural minefield in countries where some ethnic groups practice it but others do not.\nStill, some countries are showing it can be done. In Botswana, circumcision was largely stopped in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by British colonial-era administrators and Christian missionaries.\nBut Festus Mogae, who was president from 1998 to 2008, provided a critical endorsement of male circumcision just before he stepped down.\nOver the past year, the government has trained medical teams to do circumcisions in all its public hospitals and aims by 2016 to have circumcised 470,000 males from infancy to age 49, which is 80 percent of the total number in that group.\nPublic awareness is being raised through advertisements on radio and television. Billboards have sprouted across the country featuring a star of the national youth soccer team.\n\u201cMen have started to flock to the hospitals,\u201d said Dr. Khumo Seipone, director of H.I.V./AIDS prevention and care in Botswana\u2019s Ministry of Health.\nIn Kenya, where the Luo do not generally practice circumcision, Prime Minister Raila Odinga, himself a Luo, encouraged the procedure and lobbied elders. The H.I.V. infection rate among Luo men is more than triple that of Kenyan men generally \u2014 17.5 percent versus 5.6 percent.\n\u201cAnything that could help save lives needs to be tried,\u201d Mr. Odinga said, adding that he had been circumcised.\nSo far, more than 20,000 men in Kenya have been circumcised in hospitals, dispensaries, village schools, social halls and tents. Teams of doctors, nurses and counselors have even taken boats to islands in Lake Victoria to circumcise Luo fishermen.\n\u201cIf the Luo Council of Elders and local politicians had been against it, the government would not have dared endorse circumcision,\u201d said Robert Bailey, the principal investigator on the Kenya male circumcision clinical trial.\nIn sharp contrast, male circumcision has no political champion here in South Africa, where the largest ethnic group, the Zulus, have generally not practiced it since the early 19th century, when it was abandoned due to protracted warfare, according to Daniel Halperin, an epidemiologist and medical anthropologist at Harvard University.\nThabo Masebe, a spokesman for President Jacob Zuma, said the Health Ministry must first set a policy on circumcision before Mr. Zuma, who took office in April, can take a position. Mr. Zuma is Zulu. The province of KwaZulu-Natal, the Zulu heartland, has the highest adult H.I.V. prevalence rate in the country, 39 percent, according to Unaids.\n\u201cThe president gets involved when decisions are made,\u201d Mr. Masebe said. \u201cIf the president spoke now, and when the time comes to make a policy, a different decision is taken, it wouldn\u2019t sound good.\u201d\nThe new health minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, spoke at length about AIDS in a recent speech to Parliament but made no mention of male circumcision. Dr. Yogan Pillay, a senior official at the National Department of Health, said a policy was being drafted and would be put forward for discussion by the end of the month.\nIn March 2007, the World Health Organization concluded from rigorous clinical trials in Kenya, Uganda and here in Orange Farm township that male circumcision reduced female-to-male H.I.V. transmission by about 60 percent.\n\u201cThis is an important landmark in the history of H.I.V. prevention,\u201d the W.H.O. said at the time.\nThat same year, a committee of scientists, advocates and others advising the South African government recommended offering circumcisions as quickly as possible, perhaps by contracting with private doctors while public health workers were trained. Instead, the government set up a task force to study the issue, said Dr. Abdool Karim, a committee member.\nThe surgical methods developed in Orange Farm are now being copied in the region. Population Services International, which provides counseling at the Orange Farm clinic, is putting them into practice in Zimbabwe in collaboration with the Health Ministry there. It also received $50 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to work with the governments of Zambia and Swaziland in the hope of circumcising some 650,000 men in those two countries.\nSouth Africa has made strides in recent years, and now provides antiretroviral therapy to more people with AIDS than any other developing country.\nBut this is not the first time its policies have lagged behind. The country delayed for years providing antiretroviral medicines to treat AIDS under its former president, Thabo Mbeki, who denied the scientific consensus about the viral cause of the disease. Harvard researchers estimated that the government would have prevented the premature deaths of 330,000 South Africans earlier in the decade if it had provided the drugs.\n\u201cSouth Africa has no shortage of scientists,\u201d said Olive Shisana, chief executive officer of South Africa\u2019s government-financed Human Sciences Research Council. \u201cWe have a shortage of people willing to take the evidence that exists and use it for public health.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/world/africa/20circumcision.html", "title": "South Africa Is Seen to Lag in H.I.V.

{"date": "Wed, 25 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISTANBUL \u2014 For Ahmet Yildiz, a stocky and affable 26-year-old, the choice to live openly as a gay man proved deadly. Prosecutors say his own father hunted him down, traveling more than 600 miles from his hometown to shoot his son in an old neighborhood of Istanbul.\nMr. Yildiz was killed 16 months ago, the victim of what sociologists say is the first gay honor killing in Turkey to surface publicly. He was shot five times as he left his apartment to buy ice cream. A witness said dozens of neighbors watched the killing from their windows, but refused to come forward. His body remained unclaimed by his family, a grievous fate under Muslim custom.\nHis father, Yahya Yildiz, whose trial in absentia began in September, is on the run and believed to be hiding in northern Iraq.\nThe case, which has caused a bout of national soul-searching, has underlined the tensions between the secular modern Turkey of cross-dressing pop stars and a more traditionalist Turkey, in which conservative Islam increasingly holds sway.\nAhmet Kaya, Ahmet Yildiz\u2019s cousin, said Mr. Yildiz was the only son of a deeply religious and wealthy Kurdish family from Sanliurfa, in the predominantly Kurdish southeast.\nMr. Kaya said Mr. Yildiz, a straight-A physics student who had hoped to become a teacher, was tutoring fellow students so he could make extra money to live independently. But by coming out as gay in a patriarchal tribal family, he had become the ultimate affront to both religious and filial honor, even with parents who adored him.\n\u201cAhmet\u2019s father had warned him to return to their village and to see a doctor and imam in order to cure him of his homosexuality and get married, but Ahmet refused,\u201d Mr. Kaya said. \u201cAhmet loved his family more than anything else and he was tortured about disappointing them. But in the end, he decided to be who he was.\u201d\nThat clash of values permeates Turkish society. While Turkey\u2019s aspiration to join the European Union is pushing the Muslim-inspired government to accept and even promote civil liberties for women and homosexuals, some traditionalists remain ill at ease with a permissive attitude toward sexuality and gender roles.\nUntil recently, so-called honor killings have been largely confined to women, who face being killed by male relatives for perceived grievances ranging from consensual sex outside of marriage to stealing a glance at a boy. A recent government survey estimated that one person dies every week in Istanbul as a result of honor killings, while the United Nations estimates the practice globally claims as many as 5,000 lives a year. In Turkey, relatives convicted in such killings are subject to life sentences.\nA sociologist who studies honor killings, Mazhar Bagli, at Dicle University in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the southeast, noted that tribal Kurdish families that kill daughters perceived to have dishonored them publicize the murders to help cleanse their shame.\nBut he said gay honor killings remained underground because a homosexual not only brought shame to his family, but also tainted the concept of male identity upon which the community\u2019s social structure depended.\n\u201cUntil now, gay honor killings have been invisible because homosexuality is taboo,\u201d he said.\nGay rights groups argue that there is an increasingly open homophobia in Turkey. The military, which is the guardian of Turkey\u2019s secular state, regards homosexuality as a disorder.\nLast year, a local Istanbul court ruled in favor of disbanding the offices of Lambda, the country\u2019s leading gay rights group, after a complaint that it offended public morality. (The decision was later overturned by a higher court.)\nFirat Soyle, a human rights lawyer for Lambda, who was advising Mr. Yildiz before his death, said that three months before the murder, Mr. Yildiz had filed a complaint at the local prosecutor\u2019s office that he was receiving death threats from his family. Mr. Soyle said the prosecutor\u2019s office had refused to investigate or provide Mr. Yildiz with protection. The local police and prosecutors declined to comment on the allegation because the case was continuing.\nThe murder has divided Mr. Yildiz\u2019s neighbors in Uskudar, an old Ottoman district on the Bosporus in Istanbul where secular and religious Turks live side by side.\nUmmuhan Darama, a neighbor of Mr. Yildiz, was shot in the ankle during the attack and has filed criminal charges against his father. She said that the police had visited her in the hospital after the episode, urging her to drop the charges and to avoid becoming involved in what they called a \u201cdirty crime.\u201d\nMs. Darama, a religious Muslim who wears a gold satin head scarf, said she was the only one among her neighbors willing to testify.\n\u201cThe police and local religious officials are trying to protect the killer because they think homosexuality is a sin,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in Islam killing is an even bigger sin, and no one but Allah has the right to decide between life and death. Ahmet was a nice, gentle boy and he didn\u2019t deserve to die.\u201d\nBut Kemal, 55, a Kurdish man newly arrived to the district from the southeast who declined to give his last name, said he would disown his son if he found out he was gay. \u201cI would kick him out of the house and he would no longer be my son,\u201d he said, fingering his prayer beads.\nEven as some gay groups have sought to blame encroaching Islamic conservatism for Mr. Yildiz\u2019s death, others argue that Turkish society is actually becoming more sexually liberated. Nilufer Narli, a sociologist who has studied gender issues, noted that gay clubs and gay bars have proliferated in big cities like Istanbul. She said homosexuality in Turkey had been tolerated since Ottoman times.\nOne of Turkey\u2019s most celebrated singers is Bulent Ersoy, a transsexual, who was banned by the military government in the 1980s but has since become more popular as a woman than she was as a man.\n\u201cIt is a clich\u00e9 that Turkey is homophobic,\u201d Ms. Narli said. \u201cThere has been a rise in religious conservatism, but at the same time, because of globalization, people are more accepting now of different values than they have ever been.\u201d\nThat acceptance, however, has not always filtered down to Turkey\u2019s religious heartland, with sometimes deadly consequences.\nDidar Erdal, a 23-year-old gay man from Mr. Yildiz\u2019s hometown, recently fled Istanbul for the Netherlands out of fear that his own family was hunting him.\nMr. Erdal said his family had learned he was gay last month after he applied for an exemption from military service on the grounds of his sexuality. He said his father had gone \u201ccrazy\u201d and ordered him home, where the tribe\u2019s elders would decide his fate.\n\u201cI know all too well,\u201d Mr. Erdal said, \u201cwhat the tradition demands must happen to me.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/world/europe/26turkey.html", "title": "Soul-Searching in Turkey After a Gay Man Is Killed", "author": "DAN BILEFSKY"}

{"date": "Mon, 20 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 Cambodia\u2019s courts have been busy in recent weeks with cases of defamation, disinformation and incitement brought by the government in what critics say is part of a broad assault on civil liberties.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just walking into the situation, it seems like a series of ridiculous lawsuits,\u201d said Sara Colm, a senior researcher for the New York-based rights group Human Rights Watch, who said at least nine lawsuits have recently been filed against critics and political opponents by Prime Minister Hun Sen and his supporters.\nBut she and other analysts say the targets seem carefully chosen to send a chill through the free press, independent judiciary, political opposition and civic organizations that were introduced by the United Nations in the early 1990s.\nThe surge in lawsuits amounts to \u201ca serious threat to democratic development, which may undermine the efforts of the past 16 years to rebuild a tolerant and pluralistic environment in Cambodia,\u201d the United Nations human rights office in Cambodia said in a statement in June.\nIn the most prominent cases, two opposition politicians have been stripped of their parliamentary immunity and sued for libel by Mr. Hun Sen and his associates. Threatened with a lawsuit and disbarment, their lawyer has abandoned the case, apologized to the prime minister and pledged allegiance to the ruling party.\nThe editor of one of the country\u2019s last opposition newspapers was sent to prison in June for articles he had published, and another, soon afterward, apologized and agreed to shut down his newspaper to avoid court action.\nA young political activist was convicted of defamation in June and jailed for spray-painting slogans critical of the government on the walls of his house.\n\u201cThe court has always been used as a political tool,\u201d said Theary C. Seng, whose leadership of a human rights group, the Center for Social Development, is being challenged in what she says is a politically motivated court case. \u201cBut recently, there is a concentration of cases which seem to be very political and which seem to use the court as a political tool to silence opposition voices.\u201d\nMr. Hun Sen dismisses, and even appears to parody, his critics, declaring earlier this month that he was acting in the interests of democracy by stripping the two lawmakers of their parliamentary immunity so that they could face prosecution in the courts.\n\u201cFrom now on we are strengthening democracy and the rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not an anarchic democracy. Democracy must have the rule of law.\u201d\nTogether with land seizures that are driving tens of thousands of people from their homes, analysts say these actions demonstrate a sense of impunity in a government that has resisted efforts to strengthen the rule of law in Cambodia.\nIn the most recent evictions, about 150 poor families were forced from their homes on prime land in Phnom Penh on Thursday and Friday, part of what the World Bank called \u201ca major problem\u201d in Cambodia\u2019s fast-growing cities.\nThe court cases come at a time when countries in the region are looking increasingly toward China as a political and economic model and questioning the democratic and humanitarian values of the West.\nIn recent years, China has become a major donor and investor in Cambodia in projects that do not place the kinds of demands on governing and management that generally accompany assistance from Western nations and aid organizations.\n\u201cWe have been fearing all along that Cambodia\u2019s government is looking eastward toward China and Vietnam as models,\u201d with their strong central governments and intolerance of dissent, said Ou Virak, president of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights.\n\u201cNow there are a lot of activities recently that confirm our fear, and so it\u2019s pretty scary,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they are trying to do is to have only one strong party, and ultimately probably only one party.\u201d\nThe aggressiveness of the government has been matched by what appears to be resigned acquiescence among many of its opponents to the dominance of Mr. Hun Sen and his ruling elite in the Cambodian People\u2019s Party.\nNothing demonstrates this more sharply than the apologies that Mr. Hun Sen apparently requires as the price of leniency.\n\u201cI ask permission to demonstrate deep respect and bow down to apologize,\u201d said Dam Sith, editor in chief of Moneaksekar Khmer, a pro-opposition newspaper, as he promised earlier this month to cease publication of his 10-year-old newspaper.\n\u201cI have in the past committed inappropriate acts again and again,\u201d he said, adding that his only hope to avoid a defamation conviction is the \u201ccompassion and forgiveness\u201d of Mr. Hun Sen \u2014 which he duly received.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/world/asia/21cambo.html", "title": "Cambodia Court Cases Mount Against Opposition", "author": "SETH MYDANS"}
{"date": "Fri, 06 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 \u201cI am a tourist,\u201d were his first words. The telephone line from Falluja was bad, but there could be no mistake. Falluja\u2019s first Western leisure visitor was in town.\nNot for long, though. An Iraqi checkpoint guard spotted the traveler, Luca Marchio, among Iraqi passengers in a public minibus heading from Baghdad to the once notorious \u2014 and still tense \u2014 city and alerted his superiors.\nSoon, Mr. Marchio, 33, a native of Como, Italy, found himself in the Falluja police headquarters surrounded by bewildered Iraqi officers trying to figure out why a Westerner would wander around this city without a translator or guards. Mr. Marchio may have worried the police, but his main concern was saving money.\nIn two telephone interviews he brushed away all concerns for his safety and offers of help.\n\u201cI am a tourist. I want to see the most important cities in the country. That is the reason why I am here now,\u201d he said in heavily accented English. \u201cI want to see and understand the reality because I have never been here before, and I think every country in the world must be seen.\u201d\nMr. Marchio said he had intended on staying overnight in Falluja, but was forced to alter his travel plans. \u201cThe authorities explained to me that it was impossible because there are not any hotels here. They suggested a short tour and then go back to Baghdad.\u201d\nPiecing together an unusual travel itinerary from an unperturbed Mr. Marchio, incredulous Iraqi and Italian officials told the strange story of an accidental tourist.\nAfter being made aware of Mr. Marchio\u2019s presence in the country by The New York Times, the Italian Embassy in Baghdad established that Mr. Marchio had traveled from Italy to Egypt, then to Turkey, and from there to northern Iraq over land. A photocopy of his passport shows that he obtained a 10-day visa and crossed the border from Turkey to Kurdistan.\nThen came a 200-mile journey by taxi from Erbil, the Kurdistan regional capital, to Baghdad, where a startled Bashar Yacoub, 31, reception manager at the Coral Palace \u2014 a hotel that had not had a casual Western visitor since the American invasion in 2003 \u2014 took his details.\nA good Iraqi bureaucrat, Mr. Yacoub checked Mr. Marchio\u2019s documents and despite qualms about hosting a foreigner found his papers in order and gave him a room key. \u201cHe told us he just wanted to see Baghdad,\u201d Mr. Yacoub said.\nAsked if he thought Iraq was ready for tourists, Mr. Yacoub said, \u201cNo.\u201d When he was asked if he believed Falluja was safe for tourists, his emphatic \u201cno\u201d was echoed by staff members and guests standing within earshot.\nBut there was no stopping Mr. Marchio. For an extra $40, the hotel gave him a tour of Baghdad sights, driving him along the riverfront, where he could photograph a statue of Scheherazade, the narrator of \u201cThe Thousand and One Nights,\u201d and see children playing in a riverside garden. He proceeded to the artificial lake near Baghdad University and then to the square named after Baghdad\u2019s founder, Abu Jaafar al-Mansur, on the west bank of the Tigris.\nHe went on to Zawra\u2019a Park, a family spot with a small zoo and rides. He finished his day in the affluent but bomb-scarred shopping district of Karada, where his guide for the day, Ramez Fa\u2019eq, 23, said, \u201cWhen it became dark, he got afraid and wanted to return home to the hotel.\u201d\nThe next morning he set out for Falluja despite the hotel staff\u2019s efforts to dissuade him, insisting on taking a public bus to the city, 40 miles west of Baghdad.\nWithin hours, the hotel staff received a call from the Falluja police. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised when they called,\u201d Mr. Yacoub said. The police told him that they had found Mr. Marchio in a minibus next to a woman who sold fresh milk, yogurt and cream door to door. \u201cThey were very worried about him,\u201d Mr. Yacoub said.\nFor the eager Mr. Marchio, that was the end of his bel viaggio in Iraq.\nThe police summoned local Iraqi journalists to tell them of the wandering Italian, American marines were called in, the Italian Embassy was notified. The police concluded that Mr. Marchio was not an Italian jihadist and was a risk to no one but himself. An American marine working with the police suggested taking him to the city limits and dropping him where Falluja met the main highway.\n\u201cI explained to him that it was not safe to move around,\u201d said Renato Di Porcia, the deputy chief of mission at the Italian Embassy in Baghdad. \u201cHe is a little bit na\u00efve.\u201d\nOn Friday night Mr. Marchio was being held for his own safety, the Iraqi police said. \u201cHe will leave with the earliest flight tomorrow morning,\u201d Mr. Di Porcia said.\nWhen will Iraq be safe for tourists?\nThe Coral Palace\u2019s reception manager considered the question. He pointed out that there already were Shiite religious tourists in Najaf and Karbala. \u201cBut the general tourists, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t guess when because now the security situation is good, but you know this country, you can expect anything any minute.\u201d\nMr. Di Porcia said that the Italian Foreign Ministry\u2019s official advice for travelers is not to visit Iraq, and for those who must, \u201chave a security framework.\u201d\n\u201cIt was quite a strange situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI am looking forward to visiting all the beautiful places around Iraq, but I think not yet.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/world/middleeast/07falluja.html", "title": "Falluja\u2019s Strange Visitor: A Western Tourist", "author": "STEPHEN FARRELL and ALISSA J.

Expatriate staff members had their work permits revoked and were leaving, the organizations said.\nIn Darfur\u2019s camps, the effects were already being felt. The International Rescue Committee, for example, said it was forced to close medical clinics in three camps, leaving more than 200,000 without medical assistance. Michael Kocher, the organization\u2019s vice president of international programs, said the agency was appealing the government\u2019s decision, as were the other groups.\n\u201cOur biggest worry is about the humanitarian situation \u2014 some 50 to 70 percent of the humanitarian assistance has stopped,\u201d said Philippe Conraud, of Action Against Hunger.\nThe International Criminal Court in The Hague indicted Mr. Bashir on Wednesday. That day, he responded by accusing the West of trying to recolonize Sudan and by closing aid organizations he accused of providing false evidence to the court.\nAt the United Nations on Friday, the Libyan ambassador, Ibrahim O. Dabbashi, said that if the Council were \u201chonest\u201d about the humanitarian situation, it should defer the charges against Mr. Bashir \u201cas soon as possible in order to calm the situation.\u201d\nChina, Vietnam and Uganda, representing the African Union, supported that position, according to Western diplomats who attended the closed meeting.\nWestern nations, which pressed for a statement condemning the closing of the aid groups, lambasted the idea of linking humanitarian concerns with a possible court deferral.\n\u201cThe United States is gravely concerned by the reckless decision of the Sudanese government to expel international aid groups working to ease the suffering of Sudan\u2019s citizens,\u201d said Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations.\n\u201cThe humanitarian situation in the country is already dire, and this callous step threatens the lives of innocents already suffering from years of war and upheaval,\u201d she said.\nAbdalmahmood Abdalhaleem, the Sudanese ambassador to the United Nations, dismissed the Western criticism as a \u201cstorm in a teacup\u201d and said Sudan had compiled a dossier thick with evidence that the aid agencies being shuttered had abetted the court\u2019s work.\nHe did not make this evidence public or link specific evidence to particular organizations, but said as an example that aid groups had used their private aircraft to fly potential witnesses against the president to Europe from Darfur.\n\u201cThey are spoiling, they are sabotaging, they are doing a lot of very bad activities incompatible with their humanitarian mandate,\u201d Mr. Abdalhaleem said. He said the Sudanese government, local groups and those organizations allowed to stay would be able to fill the gap created by the expulsions.\nSeveral Western ambassadors and the aid agencies rejected the accusations against them, while diplomats and officials also disputed the idea that Sudan would be able to fill the gap, noting that the agencies being shut down delivered some 40 percent of the aid in Darfur.\nJean-Maurice Ripert, the French ambassador to the United Nations, said that the Sudanese move was a violation of its obligations under international humanitarian law.\nThe United Nations said the hardest hit would be the hundreds of thousands of displaced people living in camps served by the aid groups.\nMr. Ripert suggested that Kalma camp, for example, which is home to nearly 100,000 displaced people, could run out of water within 48 hours.\nIn Khartoum, meanwhile, representatives of Iran and Syria, as well the militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, arrived to express solidarity with Mr. Bashir and to denounce the court\u2019s decision.

She was not seen again for nearly three weeks, and later testified that she was held in secret locations, where she was tortured in an attempt to extract a false confession. She said her captors made her kneel on gravel and repeatedly beat on the soles of her feet with rubber truncheons.\nAt the time of Ms. Mukoko\u2019s abduction, Mr. Mugabe already had entered a power-sharing deal with the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, who had bested him in a March 2008 election. Mr. Tsvangirai later dropped out of a runoff vote because of state-sponsored attacks against his followers.\nInternational pressure led to the fragile power-sharing agreement, which continues to be threatened by disagreements between Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Tsvangirai, and the arrest, abduction and torture of activists and politicians whom Mr. Mugabe considers to be adversaries.\nMs. Mukoko led a civic group that monitored and documented those sorts of abuses. She was accused of involvement in a plot to topple Mr. Mugabe with insurrectionists receiving military training in Botswana.\nThe jailing of Ms. Mukoko and dozens of other activists has been cited by Western diplomats as a sign of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s unwillingness to restore the rule of law. The Zimbabwean judiciary has been deeply compromised in recent years, with many judges accepting luxury cars and farmland from the Mugabe government.\nOn Monday, despite her victory in court, Ms. Mukoko said the abuses continued. \u201cWe are still daily getting cases of human rights violations,\u201d she said.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not entirely unexpected. Ms. Mukoko was released on bail in March only to have the bail revoked in May. She was then again freed after an international outcry and protests from Mr. Tsvangirai. In June, at a hearing before the Supreme Court, a prosecutor admitted that Ms. Mukoko had been abducted illegally.\nIrene Petras, executive director of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, said Monday\u2019s decision \u201ccan be read as a movement toward the restoration of an independent justice-delivery system.\u201d\nBut she said she did not want to sound overly optimistic, complaining that the government continued to pursue trumped-up charges against the innocent. \u201cThe office of the attorney general should have refused to prosecute this case in the very beginning,\u201d she said.\nHarrison Nkomo, one of Ms. Mukoko\u2019s lawyers, has himself been jailed. He dismissed the notion that Monday\u2019s decision represented a significant return to the rule of law. \u201cNo, this was a one-shot, a rare judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t read anything else into it.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/world/africa/29zimbabwe.html", "title": "Court Ends Terrorism Case Against Zimbabwe Activist", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}

A spokesman for South Africa\u2019s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on Tuesday.\nA decision is expected by Thursday, when the annual meeting of the Kimberley participants, held this year in Swakopmund, Namibia, ends.\nA confidential 44-page report by the Kimberley investigators, completed in September and provided to The New York Times by a participant who is critical of Zimbabwe, accuses Zimbabwe\u2019s army of operating illegal syndicates that smuggle diamonds from the Marange diamond field in eastern Zimbabwe into Mozambique.\nZimbabwe is not accused of producing conflict diamonds, defined as those produced and traded by armed rebel groups. But the smuggling operation opens an illicit channel in the diamond trade that \u201cmakes possible the introduction of conflict diamonds,\u201d the report says.\nZimbabwe denies any wrongdoing, blaming \u201crogue elements\u201d for any illegal mining.\nThough Zimbabwe\u2019s president, Robert Mugabe, 85, now ostensibly shares power with his longtime enemy, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, the country\u2019s mining ministry and its military remain under the control of Mr. Mugabe and his party, ZANU-PF.\nA decision to suspend Zimbabwe would curtail the sale of its diamonds on the international market, squeezing one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s remaining sources of patronage for his military, analysts say. It was the military that organized a crackdown on Mr. Tsvangirai\u2019s party before last year\u2019s discredited presidential runoff between Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Tsvangirai.\nThe Kimberley investigators got remarkable access to the troubled Marange diamond fields this year. The report says they witnessed soldiers, who were ostensibly there to protect the diamond fields from illegal mining, supervising and directing illegal mining operations.\nThe Kimberley team, which included representatives from the governments of Liberia, Namibia, South Africa, the United States, Canada and European countries, also collected what it called credible accounts of the army and the police using extreme force, including two helicopters, attack dogs and AK-47s, against illegal miners. Some victims told the investigators that military officers had repeatedly raped them.\nIn one case, the team\u2019s truck approached seven illegal miners carrying sacks of diamond gravel who tried to run away but agreed to talk after being promised anonymity. The miners told the team that they worked for military officers who let them take 10 percent of the diamond proceeds.\nThe team concluded that the government knew about the syndicates and permitted them to operate. It said the government did not appear to have fulfilled promises to demilitarize the diamond fields, and might have actually increased the military\u2019s presence there. It described the information Zimbabwe provided as \u201cfalse, and likely intentionally so.\u201d\n\u201cUrgent corrective action is required if the integrity and effectiveness of the KPCS are to be preserved,\u201d the team wrote, referring to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.\nIn its confidential Oct. 29 reply, Zimbabwe criticized the investigators for what it called an attempt at \u201ccriminalizing the government.\u201d\n\u201cZimbabwe thought that the KP was a family where a truant child is disciplined while in that family rather than exterminated,\u201d the government wrote.\nThough Zimbabwe produces less than 1 percent of the $8.5 billion worth of diamonds that come from Africa annually, the diamond industry worries that a failure to stop the Zimbabwean Army from running illegal smuggling syndicates, as alleged by the Kimberley team, could again besmirch the reputation of diamonds abroad.\nZimbabwe is not the first test of the Kimberley Process, which began in 2003. In 2004, the group suspended the Congo Republic, and Venezuela withdrew in 2008 over compliance issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to the industry to have a credible Kimberley Process to make sure conflict diamonds do not enter the stream of commerce and that consumers are confident about our product,\u201d said Cecilia L. Gardner, general counsel to the World Diamond Council.\nThe council, which represents the industry in the Kimberley Process, as well as groups like Global Witness that have campaigned to stop the trade in conflict diamonds, contend that decisions on matters like Zimbabwe\u2019s status should be made by a majority vote of member nations, rather than by consensus.\nIan Smillie, an architect of the Kimberley Process who has since resigned and become a critic of weaknesses in its safeguards, said he was concerned that countries with political ties to Zimbabwe could block any sanctions.\n\u201cIt only takes one government to object and South Africa has been protecting Robert Mugabe for years,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/africa/04zimbabwe.html", "title": "Africa\u2019s Diamond Trade Under Scrutiny", "author": "CELIA W.

The charges center on a suspected plot to simultaneously attack seven airliners flying from London\u2019s Heathrow Airport to the United States and Canada, causing many hundreds of deaths.\nAn earlier trial ended in September with the jury failing to reach verdicts on the plane-bombing charges. But prosecutors announced almost immediately that they planned a new trial. No case here in years has drawn the same degree of attention from Washington, and officials say there has been close cooperation in preparing the case between intelligence and law enforcement officials in London and Washington.\nThe setting for both trials has been a heavily guarded courthouse in Woolwich, in south London, which was chosen, officials say, because it presented fewer security challenges than courthouses like the Old Bailey.\nThe prosecution says the bombing plot had its origins in Pakistan and involved Islamic militants with links to Al Qaeda. The accused in the case are all British residents from the London area, ages 22 to 30.\nThe seven flights that allegedly were their targets involved American Airlines, United Airlines and Air Canada, with Chicago, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Montreal and Toronto the destinations. A feature of the prosecution\u2019s case is a computer memory stick, with the seven flights highlighted on pages downloaded from an online flight guide, which the authorities say was found on a man accused of being a ringleader, Abdulla Ahmed Ali, 28.\nAt the previous trial, Mr. Ali denied there had been a plot to bomb aircraft and said the plan had been to protest British and American policies in Afghanistan and Iraq by setting off minor blasts to \u201cstir alarm,\u201d not kill people, outside the offices of American airlines operating out of Heathrow. He said that an earlier version of the plan had involved bombing the houses of Parliament at Westminster in central London, but that security there had proved too tight.\nThe chief prosecutor, Peter Wright, told the court Tuesday that the attacks were to have been carried out by means of bombs whose assembly would have been completed in midflight, with the bombers mating soft-drink bottles filled with a liquid explosive, based on hydrogen peroxide, with homemade detonators. The arrests of the men now on trial set off a worldwide tightening of airline carry-on restrictions that remains in force, including a ban on carrying most liquids in hand luggage.\nMr. Wright told the jury that the defendants were part of a wider terrorist network directed from Pakistan and dependent for its success on \u201cyoung, radicalized Muslims prepared to lose their lives in a global act of jihad.\u201d He added, \u201cThese men were indifferent to the carnage that was likely to ensue.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/world/europe/18britain.html", "title": "8 Go on Trial in London in Plot to Bomb Flights to U.S. and Canada", "author": "JOHN F.

That recurring pattern illustrated the problems facing the Obama administration as it enters its final days of a decision on its strategy for Afghanistan.\nSuccess in this region, in the remote mountains near the Afghan border, could have a direct bearing on how many more American troops are ultimately sent to Afghanistan, and how long they must stay.\nPakistan has shown increased willingness to tackle the problem, launching sweeping operations in the north and west of the country this year, but American officials are still urging it to do more, most recently in a letter from President Obama to Pakistan\u2019s president, Asif Ali Zardari, over the weekend.\nOn Tuesday, the military escorted journalists on a tour of the area, where it closely restricts access, showing piles of things they had seized, including weapons, bombs, photos and even a long, curly wig. \u201cIt all started from here,\u201d said Brig. Muhammed Shafiq, the commander here. \u201cThis is the most important town in South Waziristan.\u201d\nBut lasting success has been elusive, tempered by an agile enemy that has moved easily from one part of the tribal areas to the next \u2014 and even deeper into Pakistan \u2014 virtually every time it has been challenged.\nAmerican analysts expressed surprise at the relatively light fighting and light Pakistani Army casualties \u2014 seven soldiers in five days in Sararogha \u2014 supporting their suspicions that the Taliban fighters from the local Mehsud tribe and the foreign fighters who are their allies, including a large contingent of Uzbeks, have headed north or deeper into the mountains. In comparison, 51 Americans were killed in eight days of fighting in Falluja, Iraq, in 2004.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what bothers me,\u201d an American intelligence officer said. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d\nThe Pakistani military says it has learned from past failures in a region where it lost hundreds in fighting before. It spent weeks bombing the area before its 30,000 troops entered. It struck alliances with neighboring tribes.\nBut the pending campaign was no secret, allowing time for local people and militants to escape, similar to what happens during American operations in Afghanistan.\n\u201cThey are fleeing in all directions,\u201d said a senior Pakistani security official, who did not want to be identified while discussing national security issues. \u201cThe Uzbeks are fleeing to Afghanistan and the north, and the Mehsuds are fleeing to any possible place they can think of.\u201d\nBut there was some fighting, as destruction in Sararogha\u2019s market area shows, and the fact that the military now occupies the area is something of a success, analysts say. American officials have expressed measured praise for the Pakistani operation so far.\n\u201cThe Pakistani Army has done pretty well, and they have learned lessons from the Swat campaign, including the use of close-air support from their fighter jets,\u201d said a senior American intelligence official, referring to the army\u2019s first offensive this spring.\nBut big questions remain: How long will the military be able to hold the territory? And once they leave, will the militants simply come back?\n\u201cAre they really winning the people \u2014 this is the big question,\u201d said Talat Masood, a military analyst and former general in Islamabad, the capital. \u201cThey have weakened the Taliban tactically, but have they really won the area if the people are not with them?\u201d\nWinning them over will not be easy. Waziristan\u2019s largely Pashtun population has been abandoned by the military in the past, including in 2005, when, after a peace deal, a military commander called Baitullah Mehsud, the head of the Taliban, a \u201csoldier of peace.\u201d People who are from this area are still deeply skeptical of the army\u2019s intentions.\n\u201cPeople want to know: how serious is the military this time?\u201d said a military official who asked not to be named in order not to undermine the official position publicly.\nThe military argues that it is, saying that it has lost 70 soldiers in this operation so far, on top of more than 1,000 killed in the last several years of conflict.\nMaj. Gen. Athar Abbas, principal spokesman for the Pakistan military, said that about 50 percent of the Mehsud territory is now under army control, including most major towns and roads, and that the military would soon begin to press into villages where militants were hiding.\nFinding a reliable local partner will be difficult. The Taliban and Al Qaeda have ruled the impoverished area for so long that they have altered its social structure, killing hundreds of tribal elders and making it hard for the military to negotiate.\nThe alliances that the military has struck with neighboring tribal leaders, including Hafiz Gul Bahadur, may also prove problematic. The senior Pakistani security official said Mr. Bahadur was hosting the families of two top Pakistani Taliban leaders.\nSome American officials also voiced concern that if and when the Pakistani Army crushes the Mehsuds, it will declare victory and cut more permanent peace deals with other Pakistani militant factions, rather than fighting and defeating them.\nBut the Pakistani military argues that as long as the other groups are not attacking the Pakistani Army or state, it would be foolish to draw them into the war, particularly because Pakistan is not confident the United States will be around much longer.\nMr. Masood explained the thinking: \u201cYou are 10,000 miles away and we are going to live with them, so how can we take on every crook who is hostile to you?\u201d\nAnd there is history to overcome. One Pakistani intelligence official pointed to the American abandonment of the region in 1989, after the Soviet Union left Afghanistan. \u201cIf they leave in haste, like they left in the past, we will be back to the bad old days,\u201d the official said. \u201cOur jihadis would head back to Afghanistan, reopen training camps, and it will be business as usual.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/world/asia/18pstan.html", "title": "Pakistani Military Encounters Little Fight as Militants Flee", "author": "SABRINA TAVERNISE and ERIC SCHMITT"}

The government has asked both taxi drivers who drove the Mexican traveler to turn themselves in to be quarantined.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/world/asia/02asia.html", "title": "Quick Action by Hong Kong Reflects Experience of SARS", "author": "KEITH BRADSHER"}
{"date": "Mon, 16 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 The American military confirmed on Monday that it shot down an Iranian drone over Iraqi territory last month, in what is believed to be the first time that has happened.\nCol. James Hutton, a spokesman for the United States military commander in Iraq, said allied aircraft shot down an \u201cIranian unmanned aerial vehicle\u201d on Feb. 25, about 60 miles northeast of Baghdad.\nAlthough that location would put the drone relatively close to the Iran-Iraq border, Colonel Hutton denied speculation that it had simply strayed across the border accidentally.\n\u201cThis is not true,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was in Iraqi airspace and tracked one hour and 10 minutes before it was engaged.\u201d Colonel Hutton added that allied jet fighters had shot it down without causing any civilian casualties.\nThe American military has long accused Iran of meddling in Iraqi affairs, arming militants and contributing to sectarian strife. In recent months, however, the Iranians have refrained from overtly supplying weapons to Iraqi factions, partly as a show of cooperation with a largely friendly Iraqi government.\nMaj. Gen. Muhammad al-Askari, the Defense Ministry spokesman, said the Americans had not informed Iraqi officials in advance of their decision to shoot down the Iranian drone. Under the terms of the status-of-forces agreement between the United States and Iraq, protection of Iraqi airspace remains an American responsibility for the next three years, he noted.\nThe Iranian drone was 80 miles inside Iraqi territory without permission, \u201cso its presence was illegal,\u201d General Askari said.\nAnother Iraqi Defense Ministry official, speaking anonymously because only General Askari was authorized to speak to the press, said, \u201cDuring the Iran-Iraq war, no Iranian aircraft could ever go this far into Iraqi airspace.\u201d\nUnderscoring the delicacy of the incident at a time when the United States is seeking a thaw in its relations with Iran, the official added that the Americans had not told their Iraqi counterparts about the attack until Sunday, almost three weeks after it occurred.\nThe drone may well have been intended more to monitor Iranian dissidents in Iraq than to eavesdrop on American or Iraqi military operations. The location where it was shot down is not far from Camp Ashraf, where 3,500 followers of the People\u2019s Mujahedeen of Iran, an Iranian dissident organization, have taken refuge. Camp Ashraf is 57 miles northeast of Baghdad.\nIraqi troops have surrounded the camp in the past week and clashed with refugees there. Iran has long insisted that Iraq close the camp and expel the dissidents, but United States officials have intervened and prevented that. Since January, when the Iraqi military took over security of the area from the United States, several Iraqi officials have vowed it would soon be closed.\nThe United States military identified the drone as an Ababil 3, an aircraft developed by Iran with a 10.5-foot wingspan, launched from a truck catapult and recovered by parachute. The name means \u201cswallow.\u201d\nIt is equipped with video camera and transmission equipment, and flown by ground-based pilots.\nThe United States military also announced that a soldier died Monday of wounds received in a combat operation in Baghdad, the first American death in Iraq since March 7.\nFive American soldiers have died in Iraq so far this month. If that rate continues, March will have the lowest level of United States deaths since the war began.\nLast month, 18 allied soldiers died, according to the Iraq Coalition Casualty Count, a nongovernmental organization that tracks military deaths using Defense Department statistics. The soldier\u2019s death on Monday was the first United States military fatality reported in Baghdad this month.\nElsewhere in Iraq, the violence in Mosul continued, for which the blame is largely placed on Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a homegrown jihadi group believed to have some foreign leadership.\nIn the eastern part of the city, a suicide car bomb was used to attack a police patrol, killing one officer and wounding two others, an Iraqi security official said. The official added that gunmen had killed a woman and wounded her sister at a bus station in west Mosul.\nA 12-year-old girl was killed near Mosul when American soldiers fired at a vehicle that was speeding toward them, the United States military reported, according to The Associated Press.\nIn Kirkuk Province, gunmen attacked a communication tower belonging to Asiacell, a cellphone company, killing one guard and wounding another.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/world/middleeast/17iraq.html", "title": "U.S. Says It Shot Down an Iranian Drone Over Iraq", "author": "ROD NORDLAND and ALISSA J.

Their party would become the latest in a series of Kurdish parties that have been closed down by the court since the 1990s.

They are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and for the first time they would be allowed to attend the local primary school.\n\u201cThe children were so excited,\u201d said Sister Nguyen Thi Bao, who runs the orphanage and had been lobbying for three years to enroll them in the government school. \u201cThey had been wishing for this day to come.\u201d\nBut when they arrived, they found an uprising by the parents of the other students, who refused to let their children enter the school together with the infected orphans. Some of the parents hastily backed away when the orphans walked past.\nAfter a short standoff, the principal, who had agreed to accept the orphans, told Sister Bao that their papers were not in order and that they could not stay.\nThe children returned to the orphanage, just a short walk down a country road, where they continue to study in small classrooms, still exiled from the uninfected world.\n\u201cI was so happy to go to the school,\u201d said a 12-year-old fourth grader for whom Sister Bao insisted on anonymity to keep her from the spotlight. \u201cBut then I saw that some parents wouldn\u2019t let their children go to school with me because they are scared of my disease.\u201d\nThe girl said she understood their reaction.\n\u201cIf I were a normal child, I would be afraid, too, because I wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cI would feel the same way. But I wouldn\u2019t have acted the way they did.\u201d\nSister Bao and officials of the district and the school, the An Nhon Dong Elementary School, have met with the parents since then, but they remain adamant.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my child to be with the AIDS children,\u201d Nguyen Thi Thuy, 36, said the other day as she brought her 8-year-old son to school. \u201cHe could be injured, and it\u2019s easy to transmit the disease through blood. And once you\u2019re sick, it\u2019s difficult to become a normal person again.\u201d\nOne after another, parents who arrived with their children on small motorbikes raised their voices in agreement. If the orphans came back, said a man who gave his name only as Tam, he would pull his son out again.\nThe story is not surprising, said Eamonn Murphy, Vietnam director for Unaids, the United Nations\u2019 AIDS-fighting agency.\n\u201cYou go to any rural environment in Asia, and you are going to have similar reactions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe general lack of understanding leads to this inappropriate reaction and fear.\u201d\nMost of the parents here are farmers with little education, but the prejudice seemed to extend to city folk as well.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why we don\u2019t isolate people with AIDS,\u201d said a civil servant in Ho Chi Minh City, about 20 miles southeast of the village. \u201cEven with swine flu we isolate people, and this disease is much more dangerous.\u201d\nThere is no truth to these fears, Mr. Murphy said.\n\u201cH.I.V. is not contagious from community contact, even if you are sharing cups and saucers and eating from a communal plate. You can\u2019t get H.I.V. from that.\u201d\nIn recent years, Vietnam\u2019s prevention and treatment programs have been improving, Mr. Murphy said, although so far only 30 percent of people who need life-saving antiretroviral drugs receive them.\nAbout 290,000 people in Vietnam, a country of 86 million, carry H.I.V. today, and Mr. Murphy said that although the rate of increase was slowing, the infection was spreading outside high-risk groups.\nAmong those infected, the government estimates that 5,100 are children. Although the law requires equal treatment, almost none of them have been accepted in schools because of the fears of other children\u2019s parents, Nguyen Vinh Hien, the deputy minister of education, said last month.\nHe said the ministry would try to enroll at least half of these children in government schools by next year, but the experience of the Mai Hoa orphans suggests that this will not be easy.\nFrightened and angry on that first day, some of the parents seemed heartless, Sister Bao said.\n\u201cThey were saying the children were going to die anyway, so there\u2019s no need for them to study,\u201d she said. \u201c \u2018If they are going to study, let them do it in the orphanage, and not put our children in danger.\u2019 \u201d\nThe Mai Hoa AIDS Center, with its green and quiet grounds, was founded by a Roman Catholic order in 2003 as a hospice for patients in the final stages of the disease. It added the orphanage to care for children of people who died there.\nThe children are infected as well, Sister Bao said, but are receiving antiretroviral medication.\nThe buildings behind the classrooms are still a hospice, where a dozen emaciated patients lie on cots. Altogether, 250 people have died, Sister Bao said, including 90 whose unclaimed ashes are stored behind the hospice buildings.\nSome of those are the remains of the children\u2019s parents.\nSo the orphans of Mai Hoa live suspended between the death that fills the space behind their classrooms and the life of a world, just down the road, that still will not accept them.\n\u201cThe children say they want to go to the other school because they want to have friends,\u201d Sister Bao said.\nBut the 12-year-old fourth-grader seemed to have changed her mind.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to that school,\u201d she said. \u201cI already have enough friends here.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/world/asia/14orphans.html", "title": "Exiled From School, H.I.V.-Infected Orphans Learn a Bitter Lesson", "author": "SETH MYDANS"}

The new Assembly\u2019s first task when it convenes in the coming weeks will be to re-elect Mr. Kim as chairman of the National Defense Commission, an event that analysts in the region say the North will most likely celebrate by test-launching its longest-range missile, the Taepodong-2.\nAt Mr. Kim\u2019s behest, the new Parliament may also replace members of his cabinet and the National Defense Commission, the top ruling agency. North Korea watchers will scrutinize a new lineup for any sign that Mr. Kim is preparing to name a successor from among his three known sons, or is favoring a collective leadership of political and military advisers.\nSoldiers in uniform and civilians in fine dress, dancing and singing, lined up at polling places across the country, the North\u2019s state-run media said. They voted under the portraits of Mr. Kim and slogans avowing loyalty to his leadership.\nIn the previous election in 2003, the country reported a 99.9 percent voter turnout and total support for the single candidate running in each of the 687 constituencies, all hand-picked by Mr. Kim.\nThis year\u2019s voting is the first since Mr. Kim, 67, reportedly had a stroke last August. Elections scheduled for that month were postponed while he disappeared from the public eye.\nAlthough he has since re-emerged, his illness stirred up wild speculation in the region about whether Mr. Kim had decided to start grooming a son as the next leader for the dynastic and nuclear-armed nation.\nOn Sunday, North Korean media cited an election day poem that urged North Koreans to rally around the \u201cbloodline of Mount Paekdu,\u201d a common reference to Mr. Kim\u2019s family.\nAlthough such phraseology is part of North Korea\u2019s usual propaganda, it assumed added significance, given recent unconfirmed news reports in South Korea that Mr. Kim\u2019s youngest son, Kim Jong-un, 26, had been chosen to succeed his father and was running in Sunday\u2019s election.\nNorth Korea was pushing ahead with the parliamentary elections as the American aircraft carrier John C. Stennis sailed to South Korean waters and thousands of American troops prepared to land for an annual joint exercise that begins Monday with the South\u2019s army.\nNorth Korea says it sees the war game as preparation for an invasion. It warned last week that it could not guarantee the safety for South Korean passenger jets flying near its airspace during the military drill, causing several airlines to redirect their flights.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/09/world/asia/09seoul.html", "title": "Amid a Vote, North Korea Awaits Clues to Its Future", "author": "CHOE SANG-HUN"}

The photograph was one part of an extraordinary electronic record reviewed during the trial, which the judge ruled would go on. Other tapes showed his fellow gunmen shooting up luxury hotels. Recordings of intercepted phone calls provided a spooky, real-time narration between the handlers and the gunmen, who at times needed to be prodded into action and were stunned at the opulence of one hotel.\n\u201cEverything is being recorded by the media,\u201d one of the handlers told the gunmen at the Oberoi Hotel. \u201cInflict maximum damage. Keep fighting. Don\u2019t be taken alive.\u201d\nBut it did not appear to be the evidence that prompted Mr. Kasab to confess to his role in the attacks, where more than 160 people were killed in November in luxury hotels, a train station, a popular cafe and a Jewish center. He said it was because his native Pakistan, which had denied any role in the attacks, had begun cooperating more with India and identified him as a participant.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I am innocent,\u201d he said, speaking in subdued Hindi. \u201cMy request is that we end the trial and be sentenced.\u201d\nFor the better part of a day he held the courtroom spellbound: he portrayed himself as a poor Pakistani who joined the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba only for money.

He told the court how he and his partner had assembled a bomb in a public bathroom at a train station, then planted another bomb in a taxi.\n\u201cI was firing, and Abu was hurling hand grenades,\u201d he told the court, referring to his partner and to the assault on the train station, where more than 50 people were killed. \u201cI fired at a policeman, after which there was no firing from the police side.\u201d\nHis journey to Mumbai was at once banal and strange.\nHe told Judge M. L. Tahilyani that he was broke and tired of his job working for decorator in Jhelum, a small town in Pakistan, and making a pittance. He and a friend had hatched a plan. They would earn cash by robbing people. And to improve their banditry skills they would seek out military training from the easiest source available to a young Pakistani man: Islamic militants.\nMr. Kasab and his friend went to Rawalpindi, he said, and asked in the market where they might find mujahedeen. They were directed to the office of Lashkar-e-Taiba. Indian and American investigators say that Lashkar-e-Taiba planned the attacks in Pakistan. Although Pakistan initially denied that any of its citizens had been involved, it has now charged five men believed to be Pakistan-based Lashkar operatives with involvement. The organization\u2019s founder, Hafez Saeed, has not been charged.\nIn the months before the attack, Mr. Kasab said in court, he and the other attackers were taken to a safe house in Karachi, the coastal city that is the commercial capital of Pakistan and is a world away from the Punjabi village where his family lived.\nThere the young men were cut off from the world. He said they and their trainers were not told where they would go next nor were they given any details about their mission, though it was clear that it would involve lethal weapons and deadly force.\n\u201cThey told us we were to wait for some time,\u201d Mr. Kasab said in court. \u201cThere was some problem.\u201d They were warned sternly that \u201cnobody will disobey\u201d their orders.\nIn a month and a half, they were allowed out of the house only once for a training exercise when they were taught how to navigate the inflatable boats that they would use to leave Pakistani waters.\nOn Nov. 26, Mr. Kasab and nine other Pakistani men headed toward Mumbai in an inflatable dinghy, each of them armed with a Kalashnikov, a 9 millimeter, ammunition, hand grenades and a bomb containing explosives, steel ball bearings and a timer.\nIt is clear from the electronic record that the attackers seemed unworldly tools of their handlers.\nIn one video clip, the attackers wander through the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower hotel, seemingly dazed by the opulence of their surroundings. The 30-inch computer screens, huge windows, bathrooms and kitchens stunned the gunmen, most of them in their early 20s.\nBut they quickly snapped out of it, and the videos captured the muzzle flashes of the attackers\u2019 Kalashnikovs as they opened fire in marbled hallways, kicking in hotel room doors and mowing down those hiding behind them.\nA handler instructed a gunman, \u201cFor your mission to end successfully you must be killed.\u201d\nIn the last recorded call just as the siege was about to end with an attack by Indian soldiers, a handler told one of the attackers at the Jewish community center: \u201cBrother, you have to fight. This is a matter of the prestige of Islam.\u201d\nAs one of the fighters lay bleeding, he told his handler: \u201cI am shot, pray for me.\u201d\nAnd then: \u201cPray that God will accept my martyrdom.\u201d\nWhen the smoke cleared, Mr. Kasab was the only survivor among the attackers. He was arrested and confessed on camera, giving a slightly different version of his life story to his interrogators, who questioned him in his hospital bed. He later recanted that confession.\nIn that version, first aired in Dispatches, a documentary show on Channel 4 in Britain that obtained leaked recordings, Mr. Kasab said that he had joined Lashkar-e-Taiba at the urging of his father, who said he would earn a lot of money and would \u201cgive us some of the money, too, and we won\u2019t be poor anymore. Your brothers and sisters will be able to get married. Look, son, the way these people eat and live comfortably, you will do so, too.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/world/asia/21india.html", "title": "Suspect Stirs Mumbai Court by Confessing", "author": "VIKAS BAJAJ and LYDIA POLGREEN"}

{"date": "Sat, 11 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Members of the Sunni Awakening Councils, the former insurgents who switched sides to help bring calm to Iraq, are increasingly being besieged from all sides.\nThirteen members were killed by a suicide bomber while they gathered to collect their pay south of Baghdad on Saturday, in the latest of a string of attacks against Awakening members in recent weeks. Some of the Sunnis also worry that the Shiite-led government has begun singling out the councils\u2019 leaders for arrest while their chief patron, the American military, slowly abandons them.\nOne of the most notable cases is that of Sheik Maher Sarhan Abbas, whom the government detained 27 days ago, according to his family and fellow Awakening leaders.\nSheik Maher\u2019s arrest took place in secret and came to light when The New York Times by chance contacted someone who had seen him in jail. It was one of several such cases in recent weeks that have worried not only Awakening members, but also some American diplomats and military officers.\nThe Sunni leaders have long been targets for Islamist militants and Shiite militias. And there have been other arrests of senior Awakening leaders in the past few weeks.\nSome leaders accuse the government of trying to purge them, or at the least of moving too quickly on anonymous accusations against them.\nTensions between the Sunni Awakening groups and the Shiite-dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki have been present from the start. American efforts to transfer the Awakening security forces from the American payroll to the Iraqi security forces were initially resisted by leaders in Baghdad, who say that many of the Awakening leaders are still actively supporting antigovernment insurgents.\nSheik Maher, however, was an admired local symbol for the Awakening movement, which began two years ago when American officials started courting Sunni tribes, offering money if they turned against insurgent forces.\nThe sheik\u2019s Shiite neighbors trusted him and his Sunni followers so much that they took them into their own homes when the insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia was still strong. United States soldiers at a nearby base say they considered him a reliable ally, and still do.\nYet on March 15, just after midnight, heavily armed men flung deafening smoke grenades into his home in Hawr Jab, a small village on Baghdad\u2019s southern outskirts, his family said.\nThey burst into the bedroom where Sheik Maher and his wife were watching television as their 3-year-old daughter slept in a small bed next to them.\n\u201cHe thought Al Qaeda had finally come for him,\u201d said Shada Rasheed, 23, his wife, as she cradled their daughter in her arms.\nThe Times learned of Sheik Maher\u2019s detention from another Awakening leader, Raad Ali, whom the Iraqi government had similarly detained on terrorism charges but had released under pressure from the Americans.\nAsked about Sheik Maher\u2019s detention, Mohammed Salman al-Saady, who leads the ministerial office that deals with Awakening groups, said he knew nothing of the case.\nBut he said: \u201cAn Awakening member is forgiven for everything except murder. The right question to ask is, \u2018Why was this person arrested?\u2019 \u201d\nSheik Maher had long known he was wanted by the Sunni militants he had spent much of the past two and half years fighting. But the troops who arrested him told his family members that they had been sent directly by the prime minister\u2019s office.\nAccompanying the Iraqis were American forces, the family members said. The captain of the local American unit said the troops were probably from a Special Operations unit, which typically does not inform the local forces of raids.\n\u201cWhen they detained him, we were all shocked,\u201d said Capt. Kip Kowalski, the American commanding officer at the joint security station in Hawr Jab, near Sheik Maher\u2019s home.\nCaptain Kowalski\u2019s unit apologized to the family but said they were powerless to help; the local Iraqi Army unit forbade Sheik Maher\u2019s Awakening followers from holding a peaceful demonstration to demand his release.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the local council leader here,\u201d Captain Kowalski said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have anything on him, but as far as helping to get him released, it\u2019s a government of Iraq arrest. If they have a warrant it just has to work its way through the process.\u201d\nMany Awakening officials, and some American officers who work with them, say they believe that arrests of people like Sheik Maher are the result of a new strategy by Sunni extremists to get their most effective enemies off the streets.\nFormer members of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the theory goes, secretly tell the government that the Awakening leader is himself a Qaeda infiltrator and should be arrested for past crimes. Under the Iraqi legal system, if there are two witnesses, the government can issue a warrant, detain a suspect and then investigate.\nA second approach is for members of Qaeda families who have lost some of their relatives to violence to sue the Awakening members, who often are responsible for killing Qaeda members during the last two years of fighting, said Captain Kowalski, who says his unit has heard of several similar cases.\nDetention can sometimes last months, and people who are detained on terrorism charges have \u201cno visitors, no lawyers, no sun,\u201d Mr. Ali said, describing the conditions during his detention, which lasted a week.\nFirst Lt. Jobie Siemer, of the First Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry, who has worked closely with Sheik Maher in Hawr Jab, said, \u201cThere are a lot of good people around here who I know killed a bunch of people, but they were defending their land and they were helping us and that was a good thing.\nShiite government officials have long been suspicious of the Sons of Iraq, worried that they could become the armed core of a future insurgency. But for their part, Sunni Awakening leaders say the government may be too quick to accept accusations against them.\n\u201cThey should do research for three months before they arrest people,\u201d said Mr. Ali, the Awakening leader in Ghaziliya, who saw Sheik Maher in detention.\n\u201cThis is how the terrorists are trying to come back in. It is one of their plans to remove us, to get us off the street and then they can sneak back in,\u201d he said.\nA senior American official in Iraq was also skeptical of the motives for the arrests. \u201cWhy is the government doing this?\u201d said the official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the news media.\n\u201cEvery time we said to the government, \u2018You have to let this guy go,\u2019 they do it, which they wouldn\u2019t if they thought he was really dangerous,\u201d the American said. \u201cI think they have their hand in the sectarian cookie jar.\u201d\nThe 13 Awakening members who died Saturday were at an Iraqi Army base in Babil Province collecting their meager pay, which had been delayed for three months. Everyone in the room was dressed in the same Awakening uniform, suggesting that the bomber slipped in disguised as one of them.\nAt least 12 Awakening figures have been killed in Babil this year, the police said.\nSaoud Auda, 30, a father of eight, was badly burned in the suicide bomber\u2019s attack, which came just after he had been paid.\n\u201cI was looking forward to going home and paying the grocer and buying my little son a toy airplane,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my money burned with my body.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/world/middleeast/12iraq.html", "title": "Arrests Deepen Iraqi Sunnis\u2019 Bitterness", "author": "ALISSA J.

{"date": "Tue, 09 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BRUSSELS \u2014 Nick Griffin was in a celebratory mood, until the eggs started flying.\nOn Tuesday morning, two days after his far-right British National Party secured its first seats in the European Parliament, Mr. Griffin called the victory \u201ca huge breakthrough in British politics.\u201d\nSeveral hours later, he was forced to abandon a news conference in London when he was pelted with eggs.\nMr. Griffin, a smartly dressed and articulate graduate of Cambridge University, has worked hard to move his party beyond the confrontational street politics of its past into mainstream politics while remaining true to its core beliefs. But that transformation, if it succeeds at all in a country where voters pride themselves on their refusal to put extremists into Parliament, promises to be a bumpy one.\nThe British National Party opposes what Mr. Griffin calls the \u201ccreeping Islamification\u201d of Britain, supports voluntary repatriation of immigrants and wants to take Britain out of the European Union and NATO.\nIts agenda failed to gain much traction until recent months. But British politics is passing through an unusually turbulent phase, and Mr. Griffin\u2019s party has exploited a drastic slump in support for the establishment political parties, particularly the governing Labor Party, after a scandal over Parliament members\u2019 expenses.\nAnalysts say the British National Party has tapped into the frustration of working-class voters, particularly in the gritty rust-belt cities of northwestern England, who are disillusioned with Labor.\nBut beyond resulting from an effort to capitalize on voter unrest, Mr. Griffin\u2019s victory is the culmination of a campaign to modernize the party and shake off a reputation for anti-Semitism and the politics of incitement it earned in a previous era.\nNow, with two seats in the European Parliament, one of them to be Mr. Griffin\u2019s, the party will receive much-needed financing and a higher profile as broadcasters feel obliged to invite its leaders to more television talk shows.\nAnd Mr. Griffin, 50, invariably dressed in a suit and tie, is the presentable face of the extreme right, a cause he has spent most of his adult life fighting for.\nEven before college, where he spent time boxing and organizing political meetings, Mr. Griffin was attracted to extremist politics. When he was 15 he attended a meeting of the far-right National Front, which he later joined.\nMarried to a nurse and the father of four children, he lives in Wales, where he keeps two Rottweilers.\nMr. Griffin denies that the British National Party is racist, though he admits that it operates a \u201crestrictive membership policy\u201d and that it is therefore not open to all races or ethnicities.\nBut as Tuesday\u2019s egg-pelting shows, the party\u2019s ideas remain divisive. Mr. Griffin is still a pariah to the establishment. Last month he made tabloid headlines when it looked as if he might attend one of the queen\u2019s garden parties at Buckingham Palace as a guest of a London politician. (He ultimately opted not to go.)\nIn 1997 he helped write a pamphlet titled \u201cWho are the Mindbenders?,\u201d in which he asked whether there was a significant Zionist influence over the British news media. He was found guilty of distributing material likely to incite racial hatred and given a two-year suspended prison sentence.\nNevertheless, Mr. Griffin was a modernizer within the party, someone who recognized that compared with other European parties on the far right, the British National Party was underperforming.\nIn an interview several weeks ago, as he ate bangers and mash in the Turf pub in Carlisle, not far from the border with Scotland, he described how the party had changed tack.\nPast tactics had included \u201cholding confrontational marches and meetings at which the far left was guaranteed to come along and smash it up \u2014 and then having a punch-up,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt was,\u201d he added, \u201ctremendous fun, but it was terrible politics.\u201d\nSo the party adjusted its tactics. During the European election campaign it concentrated less than it had on issues like race and immigration, and more on taunting mainstream politicians embroiled in the parliamentary expenses scandal. It also demanded \u201cBritish jobs for British workers,\u201d a phrase once used by Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\nThe Labor Party left an opening for a party \u201cactively looking after the working class, manufacturing industry and public services,\u201d Mr. Griffin said, while the Conservatives had moved to the center, opening up \u201cthe hang-\u2019em, flog-\u2019em\u201d space.\nAccording to Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin, two academics at the University of Manchester, it is predominantly Labor that is losing ground to Mr. Griffin\u2019s party.\nA study they conducted, to be published soon, concludes that the party\u2019s support is concentrated \u201camong social groups who might be described as \u2018traditional\u2019 Labor supporters, older, less educated working-class men.\u201d They are likely to be unskilled and live in the north, and to \u201cexpress exceptionally high levels of anxiety about immigration.\u201d\nDenis MacShane, a former Labor minister who represents a British National battleground in the British Parliament, conceded that there was \u201ca view, which has some merit, that Labor in its love affair with the middle classes has ignored the needs of the white working class.\u201d\nHowever, he added, countries with stronger social policies to support poorer people still elect extremist European deputies.\nMr. Griffin now hopes that, with more resources and a higher profile, he will be able to imitate France\u2019s National Front, which used its European Parliament seat as a platform for national success.\nThat seems unlikely at present because, while European Parliament elections are fought under a system that rewards parties according to the votes they receive, the British Parliament is chosen by a method that puts small parties at a disadvantage.\nNevertheless, the collapse of Labor\u2019s support suggests that when a general election is called over the next year, the British National Party may have a chance of winning one or two seats.\n\u201cThere is,\u201d Mr. Goodwin said, \u201ca large pool of people who are overwhelmingly concerned with immigration and disaffected with the main parties.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/world/europe/10party.html", "title": "A Rightist Harnesses British Discontent", "author": "STEPHEN CASTLE"}
{"date": "Tue, 08 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 A series of car bombings devastated government institutions across Baghdad on Tuesday, provoking public and political denunciations of the country\u2019s prime minister and the security forces he oversees. The attacks came as officials agreed at last to set a date in March for a national election.\nThe bombings, a coordinated assault on the capital, highlighted an ominous convergence of politics and violence, which American and Iraqi officials have long warned will mar the country\u2019s election. The vote, originally scheduled for January, was delayed by ethnic and sectarian disputes resolved only two days ago.\nFive bombs, at least three detonated by suicide attackers, struck a courthouse, two colleges, a mosque and a bank. They created chaos across the city, locking down entire neighborhoods, overwhelming the police and rescue workers, and filling hospitals with the wounded. In one, a woman with her hair scorched and neck bloodied agonized as her child lay dying in a hallway.\nAt least 121 people were killed and more than 400 were wounded, according to police and hospital officials.\nThe attacks appeared intended to cripple the government\u2019s basic ability to function, and at least in part they succeeded. Two government institutions struck on Tuesday, the Finance Ministry and an appeals court, had only just relocated to new buildings after similar attacks destroyed their old offices in August and October.\nMany victims, standing amid debris and carnage, blamed Iraq\u2019s army and police force, which have taken charge of security as American forces have withdrawn from cities. They also linked the attacks to the protracted political jockeying over the election. \u201cAre we cursed?\u201d yelled a young woman near the mosque that was struck in Qahira, in northeast Baghdad. She had burns over her arms and legs. \u201cWhen will we be finished with this election issue?\u201d Prospective candidates blamed the security forces and the government for once again failing to protect the heart of Baghdad.\nThe attacks were the worst in Iraq since twin suicide bombings destroyed three government agencies on Oct. 25, killing at least 155. They fit a pattern of spectacularly lethal attacks in the capital, followed by weeks of relative calm. In August, two suicide car bombs struck the country\u2019s Finance and Foreign Ministries, killing at least 122. Those attacks became known as Bloody Sunday and Bloody Wednesday, respectively. Officials and average Iraqis promptly added the adjective to Tuesday, as well.\n\u201cWe can only hope that not every day will turn into Bloody Days,\u201d Wathab Shakir, a Sunni lawmaker, declared during a stormy session of Parliament convened hours after the attacks.\nThe bombings underscored the inability of Iraq\u2019s security forces to stop carefully orchestrated attacks, despite an overwhelming presence at checkpoints that punctuate every major street in Baghdad.\nNot one of dozens of lawmakers who fulminated in Parliament expressed any confidence in Iraq\u2019s security, a rare display of unity across political and sectarian divisions.\nThe session included calls for the resignations of senior military and police commanders, particularly the head of the Baghdad Operations Command, Gen. Aboud Qanbar, appointed by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. \u201cThe Iraqi government holds a great deal of responsibility for the bombings today and those in the past because of its negligence,\u201d said Hassan al-Shimary, a member of Parliament from Fadhila, a party that joined a Shiite-led coalition challenging Mr. Maliki in the coming election.\nThe blasts began shortly after 10 a.m. and reverberated through the city for the next 50 minutes, sending enormous plumes of black smoke skyward. The first occurred in Dora, in southern Baghdad, when a suicide bomber detonated his car as he passed a police patrol near the entrance to a vocational college.\nAt least nine people were killed there, including three police officers. At least 31 others were hospitalized, many of them students. Broken glass, body parts, blood and sewage covered the street.\nOne of the deadliest attacks struck the headquarters of the Rafaidyan Bank downtown, where many workers from the Finance Ministry had moved after the ministry\u2019s building was destroyed in the August bombings. Dozens died there, though officials did not have an exact toll.\n\u201cThe bomber wanted numbers,\u201d Capt. Saif al-Dairi of the Federal Police said at the scene in Dora. \u201cHe wanted to kill as many people as possible.\u201d\nAmerican helicopters and surveillance drones circled the city in the immediate aftermath, while sporadic gunfire erupted. American soldiers, including explosives experts, joined Iraqi security forces responding to the attacks, a military spokesman, Maj. Joseph E. Scrocca, said in a statement.\nIn the attacks in August and October, Iraqi forces kept the Americans at arm\u2019s length, allowing them to play a minimal, and belated, role.\nAnother bomb struck a compound in western Baghdad that included the new offices of the Cassation Court, a federal appeals body. A suicide bomber plowed his car through the main checkpoint leading into the compound and denoted explosives hidden inside. The city\u2019s Art Institute, next to the court, was also damaged; art students poured from the building covered in bloodied dust.\n\u201cThey looked like they had just risen from the tomb,\u201d said Haydar Mohsin, a passer-by.\nThe office of a former prime minister, Ayad Allawi, is located 300 yards from that blast. Its windows were shattered, its doors wrenched from their jambs.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Allawi, who has announced a political coalition with a senior secular Sunni leader, Saleh al-Mutlaq, released a statement denouncing the failure of Mr. Maliki\u2019s government to stop such attacks. \u201cThe government always forms investigation committees after each explosion, but it comes up with nothing later,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\nMr. Maliki blamed \u201cthe black fingerprints\u201d of the Baath Party and Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, as he did after the August and October bombings.\n\u201cThe timing of these cowardly terrorist attacks that took place in Baghdad today, after the Parliament succeeded in overcoming the last obstacle to conducting elections, confirms that the enemies of Iraq and its people are aiming to create chaos in the country, blocking political progress and delaying the elections,\u201d Mr. Maliki said in a statement.\nThe elections, widely seen as a test of the country\u2019s political progress, will be only the second since the American invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein. But even in the decision on a date, at last, there was some discord. The government first said the vote would be held March 6, then changed it to March 7 after Kurds complained.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/world/middleeast/09iraq.html", "title": "Election Date Set in Iraq as Bombs Kill Scores", "author": "STEVEN LEE MYERS and MARC SANTORA"}

But on just the 15th day of the proceedings, the accused abruptly shifted tactics.\nThe four defendants notified the court on Tuesday that they planned to change their pleas to guilty, a court official and defense lawyers said, although the change will not be official until the trial resumes in two weeks.\nGerman authorities arrested three of the suspects in September 2007 with 26 military detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide, more explosive material than was used in the 2004 bombings of commuter trains in Madrid. The fourth man was arrested a few months later in Turkey.\nGerman security officials said the suspects had visited terrorist training camps in the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan. They are accused of being members of the Islamic Jihad Union, a radical group based in Central Asia with roots in Uzbekistan. The four men are accused of planning attacks against a list of targets, including the airport in Frankfurt and Ramstein Air Base, an American installation in Germany.\nThe men have been held without bail.\nThe change of heart by the defendants, known in Germany as the Sauerland Cell after the region where they were arrested, was a testament to the more than 500 file folders of evidence gathered by the police and the case put together by prosecutors, defense lawyers said. Prosecutors had begun to lay out that case in court since the trial opened in April.\nYet the decisive twist in this case may have hinged at least in part on simple boredom.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less how long you give me, whether it\u2019s 20 or 30 years,\u201d Adem Yilmaz, a Turkish man raised in Germany, declared in open court on Tuesday, according to the German news agency dpa. \u201cI just want to get what we\u2019re doing here over and done with. It\u2019s boring.\u201d\nAfter Mr. Yilmaz announced his intention to confess, the presiding judge, Ottmar Breidling, had plain words of his own for him and the other defendants, telling them that it was time to come clean and stop playing games. \u201cAll cards on the table out in the open and not marked,\u201d Judge Breidling said.\nThe trial recessed so the four accused men could meet privately with one another, under guard but without lawyers present, said Ulrich Egger, a spokesman for the court.

Similar sympathy strikes are under way in Ottawa, London, Berlin, Stockholm and The Hague.\nIn addition to those killed, hundreds of other members of the exile group were wounded when Iraqi forces, newly empowered by the pullback of American combat troops, tried to forcibly take over their camp, Ashraf, north of Baghdad, at the end of July. The group fears mistreatment and expulsion at the hands of the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government, which has many ties to Iran.\nThe protesters are calling for the resumption of American protection of the camp until a United Nations presence can be arranged and for the release of 36 members who have been detained since the clash at Camp Ashraf, which is home to about 3,400 people.\nA local Iraqi court has ordered the detainees\u2019 release, but the government has appealed.\nSo far, the pleas from the protesters in Washington have elicited little reaction from the White House. But then the People\u2019s Mujahedeen, also known as the M.E.K. and Mujahedeen Khalq, has a complicated history and still-disputed connections to enemies of the United States.\nIt remains on the State Department list of foreign terrorist groups (though Britain and the European Union have dropped that designation); it was linked to the assassinations of senior Iranian figures; it has been called \u201cfar left\u201d and \u201ccultlike\u201d by analysts; and at one time it had friendly relations with Saddam Hussein, who provided space for its camp when the exiles \u2014 enemies of his enemy \u2014 needed a home.\nThe group\u2019s defenders say its thinking has evolved as it has sought wider acceptance. It renounced violent tactics in 2001. In 2003, at the United States\u2019 urging, it proclaimed neutrality in the Iraq war and turned over its weapons to American troops. Its members were declared by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in 2004 to be \u201cprotected persons\u201d under the Fourth Geneva Convention, and now it is pressing to be dropped from the United States terrorist list.\n\u201cTimes have changed; we\u2019ve grown up,\u201d said Ali Safavi, a spokesman.\nAnalysts say the Obama administration is torn. The group\u2019s fierce opposition to the Tehran government and its help in providing intelligence about the Iranian nuclear program have made it useful to those in the administration seeking to contain that threat, but awkward for those seeking dialogue and reconciliation with Iran.\n\u201cThis is not a black-and-white situation,\u201d said Jon B. Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\u201cThere\u2019ve long been people in the U.S. government who thought the M.E.K. was useful as a way to put pressure on the Iranian government,\u201d said Mr. Alterman, a former senior policy planner at the State Department. \u201cAnd there are people who\u2019ve said these are not the kinds of people we should be hanging out with.\u201d\nAsked about the group this week, a White House spokesman, Tommy Vietor, said, \u201cThe U.S. government continues to urge the government of Iraq to honor its public commitments to treat the M.E.K. humanely and in accordance with Iraqi and international law.\u201d\n\u201cWe are working with international organizations to help address the difficult situation of this group in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cWe empathize with and respect the concerns that many have expressed for their friends and loved ones in Iraq.\nDespite the administration\u2019s stance, the group has garnered support from some of the most staunch conservatives in Congress, and some liberals.\nThe Iranians, said one of the conservatives, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, were \u201can imperfect group.\u201d But, he added in a phone interview, \u201cMy belief is that we should be helping anybody who\u2019s dedicated to bringing down the mullah regime in Iran.\u201d\nRepresentative Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, said, \u201cThe United States has a moral and legal obligation to protect these Iranian political dissidents and Camp Ashraf.\u201d\nRepresentative Sheila Jackson-Lee, a Texas Democrat, has expressed particular concern about the welfare of the estimated 1,000 women at Camp Ashraf.\nBut many American officials remain deeply skeptical of the group, including the claims that the 36 detainees in Iraq are on their own serious hunger strike.\nThe protesters in Washington say they are limiting themselves to tea, water, sugar and Gatorade. Dr. Gary Morsch, 58, an Army Reserve doctor who served at Camp Ashraf in 2004 \u2014 and expresses sympathy for the Iranians\u2019 cause \u2014 said that situation was precarious.

The oldest member was a 79-year-old woman.\nThey never got to protest; within an hour of being interviewed by The New York Times about their plans, they were detained by scores of plainclothes police officers who had followed them from their home in the Guangxi Autonomous Region. They were then driven back south. The daughter, a woman whose name is Ms. Dang, said no one had been allowed to see Ms. Zhong since she was driven back to her hometown.\nAnother daughter who had come to Beijing with Ms. Zhong is also being detained, said Ms. Dang, who asked that only her surname be used, citing fear of government reprisal.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how her health is,\u201d Ms. Dang said of her mother. \u201cOf course I\u2019m anxious.\u201d\nMs. Zhong\u2019s original plan when she flew to Beijing was to apply for a permit to hold a protest. During the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the Chinese government had said anyone could apply to hold a protest in one of three designated parks in Beijing. In the end, no permits were granted, and the government even detained some people who had applied, including two frail grandmothers in their 70s.\nMs. Zhong, who had heard about the earlier detentions, said she became too scared to apply for a permit when she heard that she had to do so in person. So on Sept. 10, she and one of her daughters walked out of an apartment in Beijing where Liuzhou\u2019s would-be protesters had been hiding. They were on their way to hold their protest when they were picked up by the police from Guangxi.\nThe other people in the apartment were also detained when they walked out the same afternoon.\nOne of the other women, Huang Liuhong, and her 4-month-old son have not been seen since September, when the two were put under arrest in a government hotel in Liuzhou, said one of her sisters.\nTwo other sisters and Ms. Huang\u2019s mother, 79, had also gone for the protest and were arrested in September. The mother has been released, but the other sisters are still in jail.\nAs Ms. Huang was being driven back to Liuzhou in September, she said by cellphone that the police had stripped her of her clothes so she would not flee.\n\u201cI have no idea where they are,\u201d the sister said Saturday. \u201cThe police won\u2019t let me see them.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/world/asia/22beijing.html", "title": "After 5 Months, China to Try Would-Be Protester", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}
{"date": "Fri, 06 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ROME \u2014 The Italian government on Friday passed an emergency decree to keep a woman in a vegetative state alive on a feeding tube, circumventing a high court decision and ignoring a warning from the Italian president that he would refuse to sign the decree.\nPrime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s cabinet introduced the measure the day a private clinic was to begin removing the feeding tube of Eluana Englaro, 38, who has been in a coma since a car accident in 1992. Her father has won several court battles to remove the tube, saying it was his daughter\u2019s wish not to be kept alive artificially.\nThe case has caused intense polemics and divided this mostly Roman Catholic country, where it has been compared to the case of Terri Schiavo in the United States. Ms. Schiavo was allowed to die in 2005 after a long legal battle by her husband to get her feeding tube removed.\nThe Catholic Church has been vehemently opposed to removing Ms. Englaro\u2019s feeding tube, saying it was tantamount to euthanasia, which is illegal in Italy. On Friday, high-ranking Vatican officials praised the government\u2019s action, while some center-left politicians and constitutional scholars criticized it.\nThe decree on Friday also created an unprecedented clash between Mr. Berlusconi and President Giorgio Napolitano of Italy over whether the case required emergency action. Mr. Napolitano called the decree unconstitutional and said he would not sign it in order to make it legally binding.\nInstead, the cabinet late Friday evening drafted the measure into a bill, which it planned to introduce within the next three days in Parliament, where Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s center-right coalition has a solid majority.\nThe emergency decree passed on Friday states that feeding a patient through a tube \u201ccan in no case be suspended.\u201d Mr. Berlusconi said the government acted because Italy lacks clear legislation on the matter. Italy has no laws governing whether a person can specify treatment in the event he or she becomes incapacitated.\nMr. Berlusconi said at a news conference that not acting \u201cwould make me feel responsible for not coming to the rescue of a person whose life is in danger.\u201d\nHe said that Ms. Englaro \u201cbreathes on her own,\u201d that her \u201cbrain cells send electric signals,\u201d and that she could \u201cin theory, have a child.\u201d Meanwhile, lawyers for the family said that previous court rulings, not the decree on Friday, were the binding authority on the issue, and that they were moving forward with plans to have the tube removed.\nThe clinic had not yet pulled the tube, according to the ANSA news agency, but it was carrying out a procedure to reduce Ms. Englaro\u2019s nutrition intake. Doctors were expected to reduce it further on Saturday and Sunday and then stop it entirely, the news agency reported.\nIn 2005, Ms. Schiavo died 13 days after her feeding tube was removed.\nIn a letter to the cabinet, Mr. Napolitano said he did not believe this individual case required an emergency decree. He said the \u201creciprocal respect between powers and organs of the state\u201d would suffer if the government intervened in a matter already decided by the courts. Mr. Napolitano had said that legislation would be the proper way to proceed, and late Friday he signed off on the bill, releasing it for parliamentary debate.\nThe government\u2019s 11th-hour intervention comes after a lengthy legal saga. In November, Italy\u2019s highest court ruled that Ms. Englaro\u2019s father, Beppino Englaro, could remove his daughter\u2019s feeding tube. The Italian government subsequently blocked the decision, but the Constitutional Court later ruled that the government could not interfere in a matter already decided by the highest court.\nEarlier this week, Ms. Englaro was moved to a private clinic in Udine, in northeast Italy, that agreed to remove the feeding tube after other public clinics refused.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/world/europe/07italy.html", "title": "Italy Moves to Keep Alive a Woman in a Coma", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}

Their goal was to provide a fig leaf of security at the embassy, and to pray to God that nobody got killed.\u201d\nMr. Gordon and another former supervisor, John Gorman, said they warned State Department officials in Kabul several times that ArmorGroup was plagued with problems and that it was determined to cover them up. They said that as a result of their efforts to correct the problems and to make the government aware of the issues, ArmorGroup forced them to leave their jobs.\nAs evidence to support his assertions, Mr. Gorman provided a packet of memos and e-mail messages that he said he and two other former employees gave State Department officials in June 2007, including a three-page memo in which he outlined an array of contract violations. Among them, he wrote: \u201cThe training program run for new hires has been plagued with hazing and intimidation of students by students. This included physical threats and perversions.\u201d\nSenior State Department officials said they were unaware that guards had engaged in that kind of activity at their living quarters at a base in Kabul. The officials spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak about a continuing investigation.\nThe charges echoed those in a report released last week by an independent group, the Project on Government Oversight, which accused the guards and supervisors of deviant behavior. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton ordered an investigation, and about 16 guards and supervisors were fired or have resigned.\nArmorGroup North America, based in McLean, Va., was acquired in 2008 by a Danish security company, G4S, and its American subsidiary, Wackenhut Services Inc. In a written statement, Wackenhut described Mr. Gordon\u2019s allegations as \u201coverstated, ill-founded, not based on any personal knowledge or otherwise lacking in legal merit.\u201d\nA State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, said that the investigation into ArmorGroup\u2019s activities was continuing. He said that more than 150 interviews had been conducted in Kabul and that so far the inquiry had shown that the department had \u201caggressively\u201d overseen the contract since it began.\nHe said that on several occasions since 2007, the State Department had notified the company about problems, and that the contractor responded with \u201csatisfactory\u201d plans to correct them. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s important that at no time, in our view, was the security of the embassy ever threatened or compromised.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/world/asia/11contractor.html", "title": "2 Say They Reported Abuses at Embassy", "author": "GINGER THOMPSON"}

Mr. Huang, a well-known blogger and civil rights campaigner, is accused of possessing state secrets, which carries a sentence of five years to life. The second defendant, Tan Zuoren, a writer and also a prominent rights advocate, faces a potential five-year sentence for subversion and is to go on trial Wednesday.\n\u201cThese trials are not about a reasonable application of the law, but about silencing government critics whose work has considerable public benefit and sympathy,\u201d Sophie Richardson, the Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group based in New York, said in a written statement released Tuesday. \u201cThe government is likely seeking to squelch those who cause it embarrassment, but in the process it is undermining domestic and international confidence in its ability to cope in a transparent way with natural disasters.\u201d\nMr. Huang\u2019s wife, Zeng Li, said in a telephone interview that her husband\u2019s trial began at 10:30 a.m. and continued for three hours. It was unclear Wednesday night when the trial, closed to the public, would resume.\nThe May 2008 earthquake was the most devastating natural disaster in China in decades, killing nearly 69,000 people and leaving about 18,000 missing, all presumed dead, according to official estimates. Initial reports from the official news media said about 7,000 schoolrooms collapsed and as many as 10,000 schoolchildren might have died. In May, the government released the first official toll of students killed in the quake, saying 5,335 students were dead or missing.\nMany of the schools collapsed even though buildings next to them remained standing, which grieving parents and advocates attributed to shoddy construction and corruption. Officials in Sichuan blamed the earthquake itself, not bad construction.\nMr. Huang, who tried to help five bereaved fathers push for investigations and compensation, was detained by the police in June 2008 and formally charged the next month. Mr. Huang ran the Tianwang Human Rights Center, an informal advocacy group, in Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, and discussed rights issues on his Web site, www.64tianwang.com.\nMr. Tan was detained in March and charged in April.

The front page of Bild, the country\u2019s largest newspaper and a tabloid not known for its subtlety, rhymed the famous Obama slogan with the words \u201cYes we g\u00e4hn,\u201d which means \u201cyawn.\u201d\nAfter Mrs. Merkel praised their common work on the financial crisis, one of the moderators made the comment, so widely cited in Germany on Monday it seemed all but certain to go down as the unofficial name of the debate, saying, \u201cBut Mrs. Merkel, that sounds now more like a duet and less like a duel.\u201d\nThe problem is that Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Steinmeier are paired as chancellor and vice chancellor in the current government, an alliance of Mrs. Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats and Mr. Steinmeier\u2019s left-leaning Social Democrats. And it is pretty hard to attack an opponent\u2019s record when it is the same as one\u2019s own, especially when they could well end up also governing together after the election.\nThe smaller opposition parties, whose candidates were shut out of the debate, claimed that their absence all but ruled out any pointed discussion of the issues. Claudia Roth, leader of the Green Party, called it \u201ca political air guitar championship.\u201d Guido Westerwelle, leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, who hope to supplant the Social Democrats as the junior party in a government with Mrs. Merkel, said that \u201ca television duel without the opposition is like a football game without the second team.\u201d\nWhile there were just two candidates, the television stations that broadcast the event only whittled down the number of moderators to four. An editorial in the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung was one of several suggesting that there had been more clashes between the journalists asking the questions than the candidates answering them.\nThere were a few points of contention. Mr. Steinmeier spoke out most forcefully on the need for a minimum wage, while Mrs. Merkel said she would cut taxes to promote economic growth and create jobs. Mrs. Merkel also said she would consider extending operation of nuclear power plants, which by law are supposed to be phased out in Germany by 2021.\nPolls showed that the 90-minute debate ended in essentially a draw, though Mr. Steinmeier, who is foreign minister as well as vice chancellor, surpassed viewers\u2019 expectations. Mrs. Merkel seemed cranky.\nVoter enthusiasm has been so low throughout the campaign season that Bild last week offered the chance to win one million euros, or roughly $1.5 million, to someone who correctly guesses the outcome of the election and can prove that he or she actually voted.\nBoth parties claimed momentum coming out of the debate.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/world/europe/15germany.html", "title": "German Candidates\u2019 Debate Hits Soft Notes", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH"}

Holbrooke, told reporters on the margins of the Group of 8 conference in the northern Italian city of Trieste, Reuters reported. \u201cThey did not result in any damage to the Taliban, but they put farmers out of work and they alienated people and drove people into the arms of the Taliban.\u201d\nMr. Holbrooke said the United States would begin phasing out eradication efforts, which generally have involved spraying or plowing under poppy fields, often under fire from Taliban militants or angry farmers. Instead, he said, more emphasis would be placed on helping Afghan farmers make a living through other crops and on seizing both drugs coming out of the country and growing and processing supplies coming in.\nThe Bush administration had put steady pressure on President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan to step up eradication efforts, arguing that defeating the Taliban would require depriving it of drug revenue. But in recent years, some American diplomats have argued that eradication was costly and difficult to carry out. And Mr. Karzai had resisted those efforts, arguing that crop substitution and foreign aid to stimulate the economy would be more effective.\nMr. Holbrooke said Saturday that the United States had \u201cwasted hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d on the eradication program. \u201cThe poppy farmer is not our enemy. The Taliban are,\u201d he was reported as saying.\nThe Afghan minister of counternarcotics, Gen. Khodaidad, who uses just one name, said Saturday that Mr. Karzai and the Afghan government wanted to see the details of the policy shift before commenting fully.\n\u201cWe are still waiting to see what kind of changes they have made in the new policy,\u201d General Khodaidad said. \u201cIf the strategy is not in accord with Afghan culture and tradition, any such changes would have no real effect.\u201d\nForeign Minister Franco Frattini of Italy said Saturday that he and the other leaders at the Group of 8 meeting \u201cstrongly appreciated\u201d the new United States policy, a spokesman for Mr. Frattini said.\nAnd Antonio Maria Costa, the head of the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, praised the shift, calling eradication efforts \u201ca sad joke\u201d \u2014 sad because so many Afghan security forces had been killed in the efforts, though only \u201cabout 3 percent of the volume\u201d had been eradicated, Reuters said.\nMr. Holbrooke\u2019s comments on Saturday were a continuation of a discussion in Washington in recent months over policies toward Afghanistan.\nLast week, in remarks to Congress, Mr. Holbrooke said the United States was \u201cdowngrading crop eradication\u201d and shifting resources toward \u201cinterdiction, rule of law, going after the big guys and \u2014 and those involved people in the government,\u201d he told the House Oversight Committee, according to a transcript of the hearing.\nHe said that drugs were \u201can important, but not the primary source of funding\u201d for the Taliban. \u201cThey get a lot more money out of the gulf, according to our intelligence sources,\u201d he added, referring to donors living in Persian Gulf countries.\nAfghanistan supplies more than 90 percent of the world\u2019s heroin, and the drug trade is estimated to account for about half of Afghanistan\u2019s economy.

Monsoon rains are expected to begin in little more than a month, and many aid groups worry that the hastily built camps will not survive the inundation.\n\u201cIf only three or four hours of rain cause this much chaos, only imagine what a full monsoon can cause,\u201d said David White, country director for Oxfam.\nThe camps occupy vast tracts of formerly forested land near the northern town of Vavuniya. Because the ground on which many of the camps were built was cleared of trees recently, the soil is soft and porous. It turns into mud almost instantly, making it nearly impossible to get trucks through to deliver food, water and medicine, aid officials said.\nLife in the camps was already tough, but the rain has made it almost unbearable, according to people who have visited the camps in the last 24 hours. The pegs holding down plastic tents have come loose, leaving some families without shelter. Latrines have collapsed, sending waste spilling into nearby rivers. Silt has clogged water treatment plants that are essential for providing drinking water and preventing the spread of waterborne disease.\nGroundviews, a citizen journalism Web site in Sri Lanka, published photographs that showed a grim scene of mud and squalor. Aid workers said that they were able to restore some services, like food deliveries, and get temporary shelters for families that lost their tents.\nThe people in the camps are displaced ethnic Tamils. Most were trapped, along with the last fighters of the Tamil Tiger separatist group, on a narrow strip of land in northwestern Sri Lanka. Government troops wiped out the senior leadership of the rebel group after a fierce battle in May. Thousands of civilians died alongside the fighters, according to the United Nations.\nThose who survived fled to camps around Vavuniya, where they have been held ever since. The government has said it cannot allow the displaced people to go home because the areas they fled are sown with land mines, and because Tamil Tiger fighters remain hidden among them. Human rights organizations and several Western governments have criticized the government\u2019s handling of the displaced, calling it tantamount to internment.\nAs the heavy rains approach, the government will need to move much faster to get displaced people out of the camps, Mr. White said. The government has pledged to get most of the displaced out of the camps by the end of the year.\n\u201cReally, we have run out of options and the only option that is left is to speed up the resettlement process,\u201d Mr. White said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/world/asia/16lanka.html", "title": "Downpours Flood the Camps of Sri Lankan Refugees", "author": "LYDIA POLGREEN"}
{"date": "Tue, 14 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SEKISEI LAGOON, Japan \u2014 Beneath the waves of this sapphire-blue corner of the East China Sea, a team of divers was busily at work.\nHovering along the steep, bony face of a dying coral reef, some divers bored holes into the hard surface with compressed-air drills that released plumes of glittering bubbles. Others followed, gently inserting small ceramic discs into the fresh openings.\nEach disc carried a tiny sliver of hope for the reef, in the shape of fingertip-size sprigs of brightly colored, fledgling coral.\nThis undersea work site may look like a scene from a Jules Verne novel, but it is part of a government-led effort to save Japan\u2019s largest coral reef, near the southern end of the Okinawa chain of islands. True to form in Japan, the project involves new technology, painstaking attention to detail and a generous dose of taxpayer money.\nThe project has drawn national attention, coming after alarming reports in the last decade that up to 90 percent of the coral that surrounds many of Okinawa\u2019s islands has died off. This raised a rare preservationist outcry in a heavily industrialized nation whose coastal vistas tend toward concrete sea walls and oil refineries.\nThe result has been what marine biologists call one of the largest coral restoration projects in the world, begun four years ago. The goal, say biologists, is to perfect methods that could be used around the world to rescue reefs endangered by overfishing, pollution and global warming.\nThey say they are using the Sekisei Lagoon Reef, which is named after the broad, shallow lagoon that it created, as a test bed for new techniques that they hope will one day make transplanting coral in the sea as routine as raising tree saplings on land.\n\u201cWe have been replanting forests for 4,000 years, but we are only just now learning how to revive a coral reef,\u201d said Mineo Okamoto, a marine biologist at Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, who has led development of the palm-size ceramic discs. \u201cWe finally have the technology.\u201d\nCritics, however, say the project might be wasted effort. They say transplanting is futile without addressing the problems that caused the reefs to deteriorate in the first place, like coastal redevelopment and chemical runoff from terrestrial agriculture. There is also the bigger problem of rising ocean water temperatures, for which there may be no easy fix.\nHere in the Sekisei Lagoon, which sits between the tropical islands of Ishigaki and Iriomote, another problem also becomes apparent: the puny size of the efforts to save a reef that stretches as far as the eye can see in almost every direction.\nSince 2005, the project has planted around 13,000 pieces of coral, at a cost of some $2 million, said Hajime Hirosawa, a preservation officer at the Environment Ministry who helps oversee the transplanting. This is a far cry, he admits, from the tens of millions of pieces that need to be transplanted in this reef alone, which stretches over an area of about 100 square miles.\nWorse, survival rates have been low, Mr. Hirosawa said. Only a third of the coral sprigs transplanted in 2005 have survived threats ranging from predators like the Crown-of-Thorns starfish to \u201cbleaching,\u201d an ultimately fatal condition caused when rising water temperatures turn coral a sickly white.\n\u201cSaving the reef is not something that we can do in three to four years,\u201d Mr. Hirosawa said, \u201cbut more like 30 to 40 years.\u201d\nStill, say Mr. Hirosawa and others, the techniques have steadily improved, lifting survival rates. One change was to shift from placing new coral on flat sea bottoms, which proved vulnerable to typhoon-driven surface waves that broke off coral, to more protected vertical reef faces.\nAnother advance was the ceramic discs, which are baked at 2,700 degrees until hardened, but whose surface contains tiny pores that allow coral larvae to take root. Every spring, a team of a dozen divers has spent up to two weeks drilling holes and gluing in the discs.\nWhile labor intensive, this method offers a more secure footing for the young coral than previous methods, like attaching coral pieces with wire and nails, Dr. Okamoto said.\nThe improved transplanting methods have become promising enough that the Environment Ministry says it plans to double the number of coral pieces planted next year, to 10,000.\nWhile the project\u2019s main goal is environmental, there are also geopolitical motivations. Tokyo plans a much larger and more expensive coral transplantation to try to strengthen the reef protecting Okinotori, a tiny, remote islet that Japan uses to claim economic control of a vast swath of the Pacific Ocean. The government wants to prevent a strong typhoon from wiping away the tiny outcropping, and with it the basis for Japan\u2019s territorial claims, which have already been challenged by China.\nThere is also a friendly race among global scientists trying to develop the best coral transplantation method. Competing ideas vary from creating coral habitat with large concrete \u201creef balls\u201d to the use of mild electric current to speed coral growth.\nFor now, the most common transplanting technique involves breaking off pieces of adult coral and affixing them elsewhere on the reef. Besides damaging the host coral, this method, while quick and easy, also means that most of the transplanted pieces share the host\u2019s DNA, giving the reef a smaller and less healthy gene pool.\nIn the Japanese method, the discs are stacked underwater for 18 months near a healthy stretch of reef, allowing coral larvae released during spawning to naturally attach and grow on the ceramic surface. This ensures that each disc carries genetically distinct coral organisms, more closely replicating the results of natural reproduction.\n\u201cJapan\u2019s methods are expensive and labor intensive, but they also bring more genetic diversity and thus healthy reefs,\u201d said Baruch Rinkevich, a specialist in coral transplantation at Israel\u2019s National Institute of Oceanography in Haifa.\nIn Sekisei Lagoon, healthy reefs are increasingly found only along the lagoon\u2019s north side, where most coral still flourishes. This has led scientists to speculate that the north side may have evolved coral species adapted to surviving in warmer oceans. Starting next year, the divers will transplant northern coral to the lagoon\u2019s more decimated southern side, said Shuichi Fujiwara, the diving team leader.\n\u201cThis is absolutely worth doing,\u201d said one of the team\u2019s divers, Ryo Isobe, 26, who works as a diving instructor during the summer tourist season. \u201cWhen I think of how colorful these reefs used to be, I know we need to do all we can.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/world/asia/15coral.html", "title": "Coral Transplant Surgery Prescribed for Japan", "author": "MARTIN FACKLER"}
{"date": "Fri, 13 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 The Chinese government had a special message for President Obama on Thursday: He is black, he admires Abraham Lincoln, so he, of all people, should sympathize with Beijing\u2019s effort to prevent Tibet from seceding and sliding back into what it was before its liberation by Chinese troops: a feudalistic, slaveholding society headed by the Dalai Lama.\n\u201cHe is a black president, and he understands the slavery abolition movement and Lincoln\u2019s major significance for that movement,\u201d Qin Gang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a news conference.\nMr. Qin added: \u201cThus, on this issue we hope that President Obama, more than any other foreign leader, can better, more deeply grasp China\u2019s stance on protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d\nFor many Americans, Mr. Qin\u2019s analogy might sound like a stretch, but it revealed which issues Chinese leaders see as among their top priorities, ones that Mr. Obama will no doubt have to grapple with after he arrives in China on Sunday for his first trip here.\nWhile much attention will be focused on broad international issues like trade and currency values, climate change and the ailing world economy, questions of sovereignty and territory remain an obsession of Chinese foreign policy. Some scholars and analysts see this as an expression of an aggressive expansionism that will only deepen as China moves toward superpower status. Others argue that China is driven more by the need to recover territory wrested from it during the decades it was known as the Sick Man of Asia, when pieces of it were humiliatingly annexed by European powers and Japan.\nAs a result, Mr. Obama can expect to get an earful from Chinese officials not only on the Dalai Lama, whom the president says he will meet after the China trip, but also on Taiwan, the self-governing island that China says is a rebel province. Taiwan receives annual arms shipments from the United States.\n\u201cTibet and Taiwan are, from China\u2019s perspective, the two core sovereignty issues, and they rank above all others in Chinese diplomacy,\u201d said David Shambaugh, a visiting scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\nDisputed territory is also the biggest obstacle in relations between China and its largest neighbor, India. On Tuesday, Mr. Qin denounced the Dalai Lama for his visit this week to the Tibetan Buddhist enclave of Tawang in the Indian Himalayan state of Arunachal Pradesh.\nTawang is one of the most potent symbols of China\u2019s unresolved sovereignty issues. China says it was once part of Tibet, which the Chinese military seized in 1951, and so belongs to Beijing. India says that Tibetan leaders ceded it to British-ruled India in a 1914 treaty. Tawang figured centrally in a border war between China and India in 1962.\nPart of the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party lies in the notion, rightly or wrongly held, that it ousted foreign influence from the country and has tried to reunite fragments of China to return the boundaries of the modern nation to roughly those of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) at its height. That includes Taiwan, Tibet, the western region of Xinjiang and, by China\u2019s calculation, Tawang.\n\u201cIn most respects, the People\u2019s Republic of China, of course, inherits the fixed boundaries of its predecessor nation-state, the Republic of China, which declared as its territorial boundaries what had been mostly the messy frontiers of the Qing empire,\u201d Alice Miller, a historian and research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, wrote in a China discussion forum posting that she agreed to make public.\n\u201cMessy\u201d is the operative word here. In the age of empires, there were no hard and fast borders, whether the imperial rulers were the Ottoman Turks or the Manchus or the Moghuls. The seat of empire had its sphere of influence, radiating outward, with tributary states occupying the borderlands but rarely being governed in the same way as regions within a modern nation today.\nTrying to define national borders along the contours of an old empire is a daunting task. If, for example, Tibet paid tribute to the Qing emperor at certain points in history, should Tibet be part of modern China? If Tawang did the same with Tibetan rulers in Lhasa, should Tawang be part of modern Tibet?\nAlong with India and Indonesia, China is one of a handful of vast, multiethnic nations that follow the contours of fallen empires. Because of their size and history, all three nations grapple with the same issues: border disputes, ethno-nationalism, occasionally violent movements by disaffected ethnic or religious minorities.\nChina is often criticized as handling uprisings harshly in Tibet and Xinjiang, which the country\u2019s ethnic Han leaders consider internal issues of sovereignty. But in dealing with its neighbors on territorial issues, China has in the recent past generally sought to settle conflicts through negotiation, scholars say.\nSince 1949, it has resolved 17 of 23 border disputes, offering concessions in 15 of those instances and, over all, receiving less than half of the contested territory, said M. Taylor Fravel, an associate professor of political science at M.I.T. The compromises have generally come at times of regime instability, when the Communist Party has felt threatened by external or internal forces, he added.\nThe big question, then, is whether Chinese leaders will continue to show flexibility on border issues as China becomes a greater world power, and as it stamps out internal threats.\nChina\u2019s maritime disputes have proven harder to settle than those on land. In the resource-rich seas to its east and south, China is trying to assert control of various islands \u2014 most notably the Spratly, Paracel and Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands \u2014 that are also claimed in whole or in part by other Asian countries. In March, official Chinese news organizations reported that the government intended to send six more patrol vessels to the South China Sea in the next three to five years.\nEven the United States has run directly afoul of China\u2019s maritime border claims: On March 8, five Chinese vessels harassed an American surveillance ship in what Pentagon officials said are international waters. The Chinese insisted that the American ship, the Impeccable, was conducting illegal surveillance in waters under their jurisdiction.\nDennis C. Blair, the national intelligence director, told Congress that China\u2019s general behavior in the South China Sea was \u201cmore military, aggressive, forward-pushing than we saw a couple of years before.\u201d\nThis all speaks to how a bolder, brasher China might handle issues of sovereignty and territory, comparisons to Abraham Lincoln notwithstanding.\n\u201cThe biggest unknown is how a stronger China will behave in its outstanding disputes,\u201d Mr. Fravel said. \u201cWhen it has compromised in the past, mostly in disputes on its land border, it was a relatively weak state. The question now becomes: how will a stronger China behave in its remaining territorial disputes over maritime sovereignty and with India?\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/world/asia/14beijing.html", "title": "China Focuses on Territorial Issues as It Equates Tibet to U.S. Civil War South", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

The service at the fancy French restaurants in the chic Louis district is immaculate, and at the luxury hotel on the sea the call girls dress like fashion models.\nThe futuristic government palaces on Omar Bongo Triumphal Boulevard, with their flying-saucer and rocket-ship outcroppings, marbled interiors and expanses of plate glass, would make the pedestrian feel humble, if there were any. It is almost as if you could be in a prosperous city in Texas.\nBut you are in Gabon, and behind the late ruler\u2019s palaces, which line the wide empty boulevard, are shacks and shanties stretching to the horizon, dirt roads and street vendors eking out a living selling cigarettes and imported vegetables. Most live on less than $2 a day in this little Central African country, rich in both oil and poor people. Evidence of the gulf between the haves (Mr. Bongo\u2019s extended clan) and the have-nots (everybody else) is always just around the corner.\nThis is the late Mr. Bongo\u2019s legacy: Libreville as a pop-up book representation of his regime of \u201cill-acquired goods,\u201d as the French good-government activists who sued him last year call it.\nThe \u201cBongo system,\u201d as people here refer to it \u2014 forsaking roads, schools and hospitals for the sake of Mr. Bongo\u2019s 66 bank accounts, 183 cars, 39 luxury properties in France and grandiose government constructions in Libreville \u2014 is etched in the streets of this languid seaside capital, where he ruled for 41 years, and also in the minds of its inhabitants.\nEven his inheritor-son Ali, the winner of a contested presidential election last month, tacitly acknowledged the stunning inequality left behind by his father, as nakedly evident as the contrast between the beguiling palm-fringed seafront, with high-rises that would not be out of place in Nice, and the slums close behind.\nMr. Bongo, who died in June, envisioned his capital as a monument to himself: legislators meet in the Palais Omar Bongo Ondimba; students go to the Universit\u00e9 Omar Bongo; athletes compete in the Gymnase Omnisport Omar Bongo. Instead, it is a kind of living museum of \u201ckleptocracy,\u201d as a Western development official here put it, a shrine to the ruthlessly acquisitive tendencies sometimes found among Africa\u2019s rulers.\n\u201cDid you go behind the buildings? What did you see?\u201d asked Marc Ona, an environmental activist and antigovernment dissident imprisoned under the late president for his work. \u201cMisery is everywhere,\u201d Mr. Ona said. \u201cCorruption is everywhere.\u201d\nA Western family here spoke of embarrassment at visiting a government minister whose house is packed with the latest flat-screen televisions and other expensive electronic gadgets, and whose garage was full of luxury cars. The top aide to a leading opposition figure, discussing the \u201cBongo system,\u201d said: \u201cYou had to bring a suitcase to the palace. Bongo didn\u2019t write checks.\u201d The president, he said, \u201ccalls everybody to the palace, and the money is handed out. That\u2019s how the country was run.\u201d\nHe spoke of a \u201csandwich system\u201d of vote-buying employed by the ruling party in rural districts: notables are called together for a meeting, and at the end, when all are tired, a tray of \u201csandwiches\u201d is passed around. Inside each \u201csandwich\u201d is up to $600.\nLooking around at an outdoor restaurant, he asked not to be named because he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a police state. They mess up your life.\u201d\nSecurity officials routinely shake down citizens for services, sometimes with the tongue-and-cheek explanation, \u201cso we can go get some juice.\u201d\nThe example was set at the top. \u201cThe money from oil kept the patronage machine going, from whence, generalized corruption,\u201d said Mr. Ona, who recently won the prestigious American-based Goldman Environmental Prize for fighting a Bongo mining deal.\nOn paper, the government\u2019s budget allocations for health, education and transportation were impressive, \u201chuge,\u201d said the Western development official. \u201cBut in reality, it was actually about 20 percent of what was on paper,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe rest was embezzled,\u201d he added, asking to remain anonymous because identifying him would complicate his work in the country.\nThe fortress-like presidential palace is an immense edifice occupying a big chunk of the seafront. In interview after interview, citizens here were angry about the effects of the \u201cBongo system,\u201d especially given how easy it is to distinguish the top government officials \u2014 beneficiaries of the \u201csystem\u201d \u2014 from everybody else. They are the ones wearing nicely-tailored suits.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tiny number that benefits from the country\u2019s riches,\u201d said a cigarette vendor, Price Nyamam, squatting on the pavement in the poor Rio district. He said he had degrees in economics and sociology. \u201cYou are obliged to do work that doesn\u2019t correspond to your aspirations.\u201d\nSeveral times during his long reign, Mr. Bongo had to contend with unrest and rioting, just as his son did last week; a Bongo family compound, walled from the street, stretches for hundreds and hundreds of yards at the edge of town and abuts, perhaps not coincidentally, the big French military base here.\n\u201cOnly the presidential family can enter,\u201d said Elie Ithengui, a chauffeur, surveying the endless pastel-colored wall from across the road. It was the day before Ali Bongo\u2019s win was announced, and Mr. Ithengui was already contemplating, sadly, the continuation of Bongo family rule. \u201cWhat can I call it?\u201d he said \u201cForce. We have been under the thumb of a single party.\u201d The opposition, Mr. Ithengui said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the weapons. Doesn\u2019t have the soldiers.

{"date": "Sat, 16 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "A pair of new studies say that more people than ever lie in harm\u2019s way from earthquakes, droughts, floods and other disasters, largely because of a surge in urban populations in developing countries.\nSmaller or poorer countries can be devastated by disasters that are relatively inconsequential in places shielded by size or wealth, said one of the reports, a United Nations study that is being released Sunday in Bahrain.\nThat study, the Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, compared the impact of cyclones in the Philippines and Japan, for example. While more people in Japan are exposed to cyclones, the estimated annual death toll from such storms is 17 times higher in the Philippines, the study said.\nYet the report\u2019s authors concluded that the level of vulnerability does not always mirror economic conditions, with high rates of disaster losses seen in a mix of developing countries with growing or weak economies.\nThe other study, conducted by the Global Network of Civil Society Organizations for Disaster Reduction, a coalition of private nongovernmental groups, notes some isolated examples where communities acting on their own have found ways to reduce disaster losses. But it warned that many governments were lagging in efforts to make such resilience the norm, not the exception, despite having pledged to do so in a declaration in 2005.\nThe United Nations report is the most ambitious effort ever to compare data on all kinds and scales of disasters against population and economic trends, development and disaster experts said. It is available online at unisdr.org.\nIt offers hints of progress. While the economic cost from disasters has risen, the cost as percentage of the global economy has been flat. The mortality rate has been declining in many areas. But in hot spots combining dense populations with the risk of earthquakes, floods and other hazards, the potential for catastrophic impact is growing.\nAdditionally, the study shows how deep poverty and rapid economic growth can increase vulnerability to disasters.\nIn a telephone interview, Andrew Maskrey, the report\u2019s lead author, noted, for example, that the breakneck pace of economic growth in China since 1990 had brought tens of millions of people to the eastern seaboard, \u201can extremely hazard-prone area that is regularly threatened by flooding and cyclones.\u201d \u201cThe country has not yet developed the institutional mechanisms to reduce the risk that entails,\u201d he said.\nHe pointed to the collapse of recently built schools last year in central Sichuan Province, another fast-growing area, as a sign of the problem. \u201cWithout governance capacity, the faster you develop, it\u2019s almost like the faster you\u2019re building disasters,\u201d Mr. Maskrey said.\nHe added that Myanmar\u2019s enormous losses in cyclone-driven floods last year resulted from virtually the opposite condition: no economic development. \u201cThere, people were killed not by schools falling down, but by a lack of schools and other buildings to shelter in,\u201d he said.\nAt the same time, Mr. Maskrey said, there is evidence that a willingness to make disaster risk reduction a priority can forge progress even in struggling places.\nBangladesh has created effective evacuation programs for coastal flooding with scant resources, and Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, has found the means to greatly bolster buildings against earthquakes.\nSub-Saharan Africa and other rural areas dependent on rain-fed agriculture remain hot spots for drought-related mortality. But the dominant factor raising death tolls and economic losses from disasters is humanity\u2019s hastening transformation into a mainly urban species, with a surge of people in search of work settling in marginal urban lands and shoddy housing.\n\u201cSome of the statistics are almost hallucinatory,\u201d Mr. Maskrey said. \u201cSome time before 2050, the urban population of India will rise by 500 million people. Mumbai and Calcutta are already very poor about providing land and housing. How will they accommodate tens of millions more? And both cities are in very hazard-prone locations.\u201d\nThe other study of disaster risks took a very different approach from the United Nations analysis, using fewer official databases and relying more on 5,000 interviews with people in vulnerable urban and rural communities in 47 countries, said Marcus Oxley, its lead organizer.\nIt detailed some innovations that have helped some communities reduce their exposure. In one rural Indian village, the report\u2019s authors said, cellphones have become a lifeline, allowing residents to track approaching cyclones through text messages sent by relatives watching Web sites in the United States devoted to weather conditions.\nThe report, \u201cThe View From the Frontline,\u201d is to be released next month an international meeting on disasters, but organizers provided a draft to The New York Times to provide context for the United Nations report.\nThe isolated success stories are encouraging, Mr. Oxley said. But he added that the sweeping scale of vulnerability to disasters showed the need for systemic changes in policy by governments, aided by institutions like the World Bank and the United Nations.\nEducation in local communities is needed to overcome a tendency to accept high disaster tolls as a matter of fate, instead of, for example, lax building codes or warning systems.\nBen Wisner, a retired geography professor in Oberlin, Ohio, who is involved with the coalition and focuses on making schools in disaster hot spots safer, said the lack of accountability in many countries, and the tendency of international institutions to focus on symbolism more than concrete change, was blocking progress.\nHe cited a recent United Nations program that distributed posters and textbooks about disasters. \u201cDoes it make sense to teach lessons about natural hazards and disaster risk in a classroom that is a liable to collapse and kill students and teachers alike?\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is a long, long way to go, and unless and until the U.N. system has the support and political will to name and shame, and to hold countries to account for failing to protect their citizens from avoidable harm in extreme natural events, most national governments won\u2019t prioritize disaster risk reduction.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/world/17WebDisaster.html", "title": "2 Studies Tie Disaster Risk to Urban Growth", "author": "ANDREW C.

From exile in South Africa, he asked whether Haitian election officials were trying to organize an election or \u201cto make a selection.\u201d\nMr. Aristide, a former Roman Catholic priest, became Haiti\u2019s first freely elected president in 1991 and won a second election in 2000. His Lavalas Family party is still considered the most popular political force in Haiti, an impoverished Caribbean nation of nine million people.\n\u201cThe Lavalas Family party will not be allowed to participate in the next election, because the electoral council\u2019s legal counsel said the party did not meet all legal requirements,\u201d the electoral council president, Gaillot Dorsinvil, told local radio stations.\nHe did not specify which requirements the party had failed to meet.\nAll but one of the 99 seats in the Parliament\u2019s Chamber of Deputies will be at stake in the February elections, along with one-third of the 30-member Senate. The vote for the one remaining lower house seat will be held later.\nMr. Aristide faced accusations of corruption and despotism when he was forced from power in February 2004 during a bloody armed rebellion. He was also under pressure to quit from the United States and France.\nOfficials familiar with the electoral council\u2019s deliberations said that the decision to bar Mr. Aristide\u2019s party was motivated by suspicions that the signature on a faxed letter sent by Mr. Aristide, authorizing local representatives to register the party, had been falsified.\nLast week, the council asked a Lavalas Family official, Maryse Narcisse, to provide the original copy of Mr. Aristide\u2019s letter. It was provided to election officials, who then decided to bar the party.\nIn a rare interview, Mr. Aristide confirmed Wednesday on Haiti\u2019s Radio Solidarity that he had given Ms. Narcisse the authority to register the party, and he questioned whether Haitian officials really wanted to hold fair and democratic elections.\n\u201cThat will depend on whether the electoral council wants to organize an election or to make a selection,\u201d Mr. Aristide said in a telephone interview from South Africa with the radio station. \u201cIf they want to organize elections, I encourage them. But if they want to make a selection I urge them not to take that path, because it will not serve the country\u2019s interests.\u201d\nThe Lavalas Family party was barred from previous elections over accusations that it had failed to meet legal requirements. Mr. Aristide\u2019s allies accused election officials of dismissing their party to aid a new coalition close to President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val. The coalition, called Unity, succeeded a previous coalition known as Lespwa.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/world/americas/26haiti.html", "title": "Haiti Bars Ex-President\u2019s Party From Elections for Parliament", "author": "REUTERS"}

The government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa tightened access to the facilities early last week, as its military tried to root out suspected rebels hiding among the civilians.\nMaking a 24-hour visit to Sri Lanka less than a week after the end of the 26-year civil war, Mr. Ban visited the country\u2019s biggest refugee camp and flew over a former battle zone in the northeast, getting a rare look into the effects of a war that the government here has tried to keep hidden from the outside world.\n\u201cThe government is doing its utmost best,\u201d Mr. Ban said after his meeting with Mr. Rajapaksa, according to Agence France-Presse. \u201cBut the government lacks the resources. There\u2019s a wide gap between what is needed and what can be done.\u201d\nThere was no response to Mr. Ban\u2019s request yet from either the government or Mr. Rajapaksa, who had rejected earlier calls from Western nations and international organizations, including the United Nations, to impose a cease-fire. Fighting since January has led to the deaths of 7,000 civilians, the United Nations said.\nOn Saturday, Mr. Ban flew by helicopter over the small northeastern strip of land where the rebel Tamil Tigers and tens of thousands of Tamil civilians had been cornered in the last weeks of the war. He also visited a sprawling refugee camp in the country\u2019s Vavuniya district, where most of the nearly 300,000 Tamil refugees are being kept in camps surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by soldiers.\nThe new restrictions have heightened suspicion among ethnic Tamils here in the capital and overseas, the very same groups to which the president appealed for unity a few days ago.\nA 42-year-old Tamil man living in Toronto said his mother and some 30 relatives in Kilinochchi, a northern town that had long served as the Tamil Tigers\u2019 de facto capital, had been trapped in the conflict zone. After weeks with no news, he said he had heard from former neighbors now living in Vavuniya that his relatives were alive and scattered in various camps in the area.\nThe man, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of endangering his relatives, said he flew to Sri Lanka and made it to Vavuniya last week.\n\u201cI wanted to see my mother and relatives, to bring them food and money,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Toronto, to where he had returned. \u201cBut the roads were blocked, there were checkpoints everywhere, and they weren\u2019t letting anybody visit the camps.\u201d\n\u201cThe government is hiding so many things \u2014 that\u2019s why they won\u2019t let people there,\u201d he added. \u201cI believe my mother is with her brother, my uncle, though I don\u2019t know whether they are in the same place.

The speaker specifically blamed the president for the Pakistani military\u2019s drive to retake an area in the Swat Valley that had recently come under the control of Taliban forces.\nThe speaker also blamed Mr. Obama for the \u201cone million Muslims\u201d who had to flee their homes because of the fighting. United Nations and Pakistani officials estimate that as many as three million people have been displaced by the conflict.\n\u201cObama has followed the footsteps of his predecessor in increasing animosity toward Muslims and increasing enemy fighters and establishing long-term wars,\u201d the recording said. \u201cSo the American people should get ready to reap the fruits of what the leaders of the White House have planted throughout the coming years and decades.\u201d\nThe recording, if verified, is a signal that Mr. bin Laden, the fugitive leader of Al Qaeda, remains alive and in touch with current events, and that he retains effective channels of communication with the outside world. The message was released a day after Mr. bin Laden\u2019s lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahri, issued an audiotape condemning the president.\nThe White House played down the import of the recording, played throughout the day on television reports accompanied by images of Mr. Obama arriving in Saudi Arabia.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising that Al Qaeda would want to shift attention away from the president\u2019s historic efforts and continued efforts to reach out and have an open dialogue with the Muslim world,\u201d said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, who added that intelligence officials had yet to verify the tape\u2019s authenticity. \u201cAmericans have seen these types of threats before.\u201d\nIf authenticated, the recording would be the first from the Qaeda leader since January, when Al Jazeera broadcast an audio message attributed to him during Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive and the last days of President George W. Bush\u2019s term.\nThe recording released Wednesday said the Pakistani authorities were doing Washington\u2019s bidding when they prevented the imposition of \u201cShariah law by fighting and killing and through bombings and destruction.\u201d\nThe recording continued, \u201cObama and his administration have planted new seeds to increase hatred and revenge.\u201d It added, \u201cThe number of those seeds is the same as the number of those harmed and displaced from Swat Valley and the tribal regions in North and South Waziristan and the number of their sympathizers.\u201d\nSome terrorism experts offered different interpretations of the motives for the new tape. Frank J. Cilluffo, director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University, said the new statements attributed to Mr. bin Laden showed \u201cperhaps more Al Qaeda\u2019s fear that they are increasingly becoming marginalized in the eyes and minds of some key constituencies in the Middle East, and their need to show they are still relevant.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/world/middleeast/04binladen.html", "title": "Message on Obama Attributed to bin Laden", "author": "MICHAEL SLACKMAN"}

Mr. Fayyad said it was meant to hasten the end of the Israeli occupation and pave the way to independent statehood, which he said \u201ccan and must happen within the next two years.\u201d\nThere was no immediate official Israeli comment, with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Europe. But two Israeli officials reacted with consternation over what they saw as a unilateral action. The United States consul general in Jerusalem expressed approval for the plan.\nMr. Fayyad, an American-educated economist and a political independent who has gained the confidence of the West and is largely respected in Israel, made the announcement in the West Bank city of Ramallah. He said the goal of the plan was \u201cto establish a de facto state apparatus within the next two years.\u201d\nHis plan was not meant to be \u201cin lieu of the political process, but to reinforce it,\u201d Mr. Fayyad said in an interview with The New York Times. Negotiations and state-building, he said, need to be pursued in parallel.\nThe Western-backed Palestinian leadership has recently been accused of passivity in its approach to peacemaking and pursuit of independence. Mr. Fayyad said the new program represented a proactive effort to form the foundation of the state. His announcement came on a day when Mr. Netanyahu met with Prime Minister Gordon Brown in London. On Wednesday, he is to meet there with George J. Mitchell, the Obama administration\u2019s Middle East envoy.\nJacob Walles, the American consul general, spoke of the plan in an interview here on Monday, before Mr. Fayyad\u2019s announcement. He said that it was the first time he had seen such a \u201cconcrete plan\u201d and that the Palestinians were working in a practical way toward their goal.\nMr. Walles added that under the premiership of Mr. Fayyad there had been \u201ca lot of progress in the West Bank\u201d in economic, security and other spheres.\nYuval Steinitz, the finance minister of the conservative Likud Party, called Mr. Fayyad\u2019s ideas \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\u201cThis is contrary to all the agreements signed between the sides,\u201d Mr. Steinitz told Israel Radio. \u201cThere is no place for unilateralism, no place for threats, and of course, there will be no Palestinian state at all, if any, without ensuring the state of Israel\u2019s security.\u201d\nDaniel Ayalon, the deputy foreign minister of the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu Party, said that \u201cartificial dates and arbitrary deadlines never worked in the past, but caused only damage and would not work now.\u201d\nMr. Fayyad\u2019s plan lays out a broad outline for a democratic Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The plan states, for example, that \u201cshelter, education and health insurance are basic rights which will be preserved and protected by the state,\u201d which also has \u201can enduring obligation to care and provide for the martyrs, prisoners, orphans and all those harmed in the Palestinian struggle for independence.\u201d\nAspirations for the economy include ridding it of outside hegemony and reversing its dependence on Israel. Goals for the Finance Ministry include reducing reliance on international aid by controlling spending and increasing domestic revenues. The government is to offer tax incentives to local and foreign investors.\nThe Palestinian Authority has instructed its Ministry of Transport to help develop legislation and plans for modern seaports, crossing points and airports, including an international airport in the Jordan Valley.\nMr. Fayyad acknowledges that the Palestinian national cause has been hampered by internal schism, which limits the authority of President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah and the Fayyad government to the West Bank and leaves Hamas, its Islamic rival, in control of Gaza.\nThe program could be adopted by any Palestinian government over the next two years, Mr. Fayyad said. \u201cIt is a rallying call for our people to unite behind our vision,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/26/world/middleeast/26mideast.html", "title": "Palestinian Leader Maps Plan for Separate State", "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER"}

Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, the spokesman for the security forces in Baghdad, accused him on Sunday of leading an armed military wing of the Baath Party, which is a violation of the Constitution.\nThe American military said Sunday that he was suspected of illegally searching and detaining Fadhil residents, extorting bribes of more than $160,000 a month from them and leading cells that organized attacks using homemade bombs and mortars. He also is suspected of colluding with Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and with another insurgent network, Jaish al-Islami.\nIraqi and American forces surrounded the neighborhood through the day on Sunday as American Apache helicopters buzzed overhead and Iraqi Army Humvees moved through the streets using loudspeakers to tell members of the Awakening group to hand over their guns.\nBy evening, the Iraqi Army was searching homes for more weapons, but pedestrians were able to enter and children were playing soccer.\nAt least one police officer, a member of the Interior Ministry\u2019s Quick Reaction Force, was killed and another was wounded during the fighting, according to a ministry statement.\nThe Awakening Councils are neighborhood-based groups of Sunnis, many of them former insurgents, who are now paid by the Iraqi government. They are credited, along with the increase in American troops, with helping to diminish violence in Iraq.\nSome members of the Fadhil Awakening Council expressed anger and shame that the group had been disarmed. They accused the Americans of betrayal, raising concerns about the anger in the neighborhood and in other Sunni areas in the coming days.\n\u201cThe Awakening is not present anymore,\u201d said Khalid al-Sammaraie, one of Mr. Mashhadani\u2019s deputies. \u201cMen whom we depended on handed over their weapons at the beginning.\n\u201cWe blame the Americans. We could not understand what is happening. It is a conspiracy against the Sunni.\u201d\nFive Iraqi Army soldiers, who were described on Saturday as having been kidnapped shortly after the shooting began, were able to leave the neighborhood on Sunday morning, Mr. Sammaraie said. His assertion was corroborated by an Iraqi Army officer.\n\u201cThose five soldiers were at a joint checkpoint with the Awakening and when the clashes started, they turned to us for help and told us, \u2018We are neutral, and we don\u2019t want to interfere and shoot at you, so we would like to stay here until morning,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sammaraie said.\nA young Iraqi Army officer patrolling Fadhil on Sunday afternoon gave a similar account. \u201cNobody kidnapped our soldiers,\u201d said Lt. Ahmad Ali. \u201cThey put down their weapons. Nobody forced them to do that.\u201d\nSome residents of the impoverished, war-battered neighborhood sounded a note of relief about Mr. Mashhadani\u2019s arrest. A few said he had bravely fought Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, an extremist Sunni group believed by American officials to have some foreign leadership, but others said he was a brutal strongman.\n\u201cAdil Mashhadani is involved in killing, stealing and displacing people according to their sect, and he buried people alive,\u201d said a man who would give his name only as Ibrahim because he feared reprisals from Awakening members. \u201cEveryone there is afraid of him.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Mashhadani was arrested, he was found with a stockpile of bullets, including 800 that would fit a BKC machine gun and more than 6,000 that would fit a Kalashnikov.\nElsewhere in Iraq on Sunday, there were multiple attacks on the police; the most elaborate was a coordinated ambush in a rural area south of Falluja, which seriously wounded three officers.\nA homemade bomb in Hamdan, south of Basra, which was aimed at a branch of the police that guards the oil pipelines, killed three civilians and one police officer. It was only the third attack in the area since last year\u2019s military operation in Basra to remove the militias that had controlled the city.\nA bomb in Kirkuk wounded eight police officers, and in Mosul two civilians were killed, one by gunfire and the other by a bomb.\nA bomb attack in the Adhamiya neighborhood of Baghdad killed an off-duty police officer and wounded at least four civilians, the Iraqi Army said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/world/middleeast/30iraq.html", "title": "Guns Go Silent After 24-Hour Face-Off in Baghdad, but Tensions Remain High", "author": "ALISSA J.

Mr. Peres did raise the issue of the missiles, known as S-300s, the official said, but Mr. Peres emphasized that Israel did not plan any military strikes on Iranian territory.\n\u201cAccordingly, there was no discussion on the presidential level of any contractual obligations of Russian organizations regarding the provision of military equipment to Iran,\u201d the official said.\nRussia signed a contract with Iran to deliver S-300 missiles, which have a much longer range and higher accuracy than Iran\u2019s present air defense systems. But amid the objections of Israel and the United States, Moscow has never delivered the missiles.\nMr. Peres spoke about the missiles at a morning news conference in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, after talks with Mr. Medvedev there on Tuesday. He said Mr. Medvedev \u201cgave a promise he will reconsider the sales of the S-300 because this affects the delicate balance which exists already in the Middle East, and will enforce, in my judgment, the aggressive intentions of Iran.\u201d\nIsrael and many Western nations suspect that Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon, while Iran says its nuclear program is solely for generating electricity. Israel has repeatedly raised the possibility of airstrikes to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear progress.\nBlocking the missile deal has been one of the United States\u2019 goals in its pursuit of improved relations with Moscow.\nAt the news conference, Mr. Peres suggested that Russian concessions on the missile contract could affect American plans for missile defense in Eastern Europe, which Russia objects to.\n\u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be for the Iranian missiles, maybe one of the thorny issues between Russia and the United States would disappear, namely the antimissile bases that the United States is building in Poland\u201d and the Czech Republic, Mr. Peres said.\nWhen asked about the missile contract in March, at a news conference in Geneva with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said that Russia would seriously consider American and Israeli concerns.\nHe said Russia supplied only \u201cnondestabilizing defensive types of weapons\u201d and, alluding to the United States\u2019 military assistance to Georgia, added that \u201cwe want our partners to behave with equal restraint in their military supplies to the countries who quite recently used those weapons close to our borders.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/world/europe/20russia.html", "title": "Israel Says Russia May Reconsider Plans to Sell Missiles to Iran", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}

Western diplomats have estimated that Ethiopia has had thousands of troops in the country.\nThe town that the soldiers left on Saturday, Balanbale, is in a region where Islamist militias have been fighting one another.\nMany here worry that an Ethiopian pullout will leave a power vacuum that Islamist factions will battle one another to fill. Those fears were exacerbated on Friday when an Islamist group took over three empty police stations here.\nThat faction, the Union of Islamic Courts, signed a cease-fire with the government in 2006 and is not allied with the Shabab, one of Somalia\u2019s most militant Islamic groups. The Shabab controls much of southern Somalia.\nSheik Abdirahim Isse Addow, the spokesman for the faction, said his group had decided to move into the police stations to \u201censure the security of the people.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is not a challenge against other Islamists.\u201d\nThe Ethiopian troops stormed into Mogadishu two years ago not only to bolster the transitional government, but to wipe out an Islamist administration that the Ethiopians considered a terrorist threat.

First came the packs of young Uighurs, then the Han Chinese mobs seeking revenge.\n\u201cTo those who have committed crimes with cruel means, we will execute them,\u201d Li Zhi, the top Communist Party official in Urumqi, said July 8.\nThe vow, broadcast repeatedly, has struck fear into Xiangyang Po, a grimy quarter of the city dominated by Uighurs, Turkic-speaking Muslims who have often had an uneasy relationship with China\u2019s Han majority. Uighurs are the largest ethnic group in Xinjiang, but in Urumqi, Han make up more than 70 percent of the 2.3 million residents.\nIt was here on the streets of Xiangyang Po, amid the densely packed tenements and stalls selling thick noodles and lamb kebabs, that many Han were killed. As young Uighur men marauded through the streets, residents huddled inside their homes or shops, they said; others claim they gave refuge to Han neighbors.\n\u201cIt was horrible for everyone,\u201d said Leitipa Yusufajan, 40, who spent the night cowering at the back of her grocery store with her 10-year-old daughter. \u201cThe rioters were not from here. Our people would not behave so brutally.\u201d\nBut to security officials, the neighborhood has long been a haven for those bent on violently cleaving Xinjiang, a northwest region, from China. Last year, during a raid on an apartment, the authorities fatally shot two men they said were part of a terrorist group making homemade explosives. Last Monday, police officers killed two men and wounded a third, the authorities said, after the men tried to attack officers on patrol.\n\u201cThis is not a safe place,\u201d said Mao Daqing, the local police chief.\nLocal residents disagree, saying the neighborhood is made up of poor but law-abiding people, most of them farmers who came to Urumqi seeking a slice of the city\u2019s prosperity. Interviews with two dozen people showed vehement condemnation of the rioters. \u201cThose people are nothing but human trash,\u201d one man said, spitting on the ground.\nStill, the police response has been indiscriminate, they said. Nurmen Met, 54, said his two sons, 19 and 21, were nabbed as riot officers entered the public bathhouse his family owns. \u201cThey weren\u2019t even outside on the day of the troubles,\u201d he said, holding up photos of his sons. \u201cThey are good, honest boys.\u201d\nMany people said they feared that their family members might be swallowed up by a penal system that is vast and notoriously opaque. Last year, in the months leading to the Beijing Olympics, the authorities arrested and tried more than 1,100 people in Xinjiang during a campaign against what they called \u201creligious extremists and separatists.\u201d\nShortly after the arrests, Wang Lequan, the region\u2019s Communist Party secretary, described the crackdown as a \u201clife and death\u201d struggle.\nUighur exile groups and human rights advocates say the government sometimes uses such charges to silence those who press for greater religious and political freedoms. Trials, they say, are often cursory. \u201cJustice is pretty rough in Xinjiang,\u201d said James Seymour, a senior research fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nIn a sign of the sensitivities surrounding the unrest, the Bureau for Legal Affairs in Beijing has warned lawyers to stay away from cases in Xinjiang, suggesting that those who assist anyone accused of rioting pose a threat to national unity. Officials on Friday shut down the Open Constitution Initiative, a consortium of volunteer lawyers who have taken on cases that challenge the government and other powerful interests. Separately, the bureau canceled the licenses of 53 lawyers, some of whom had offered to help Tibetans accused of rioting last year in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet.\nRights advocates say that if the trials in Xinjiang resemble those that took place in Tibet, many defendants will receive long sentences. \u201cThere is a lot of concern that those who have been detained in Xinjiang will not get a fair trial,\u201d said Wang Songlian, a research coordinator at Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group.\nResidents of Xiangyang Po say police officers made two morning sweeps through the neighborhood after the rioting began, randomly grabbing boys as young as 16. That spurred a crowd of anguished women to march to the center of Urumqi to demand the men\u2019s release.\nBut none of the detainees has come home, the residents say, and the authorities have refused to provide information about their whereabouts.\n\u201cI go to the police station every day, but they just tell me to be patient and wait,\u201d said Patiguli Palachi, whose husband, an electronics repairman, was taken in his pajamas with four other occupants of their courtyard house. Ms. Palachi said they might have been detained because a Han man was killed outside their building, but she insisted that her husband was not involved. \u201cWe were hiding inside at the time, terrified like everyone else,\u201d she said.\nAlthough it was impossible to verify the accounts of the residents, as Ms. Palachi spoke, more than 10 people gathered to share similar accounts.\nEmboldened by the presence of foreign journalists, the group decided to walk to the local police station to confront the police again. \u201cMaybe if you are with us, they will give an answer,\u201d said Memet Banjia, a vegetable seller looking for his son. \u201cProbably they will say nothing and the next day we will disappear, too.\u201d\nBut the meeting with the police was not to be. As the residents approached the station house, a squad car roared up and the crowd melted away. The foreigners were ordered into the car and driven to the station house. After an hour\u2019s wait, a pair of high-ranking security officials arrived with a lecture and a warning.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be here; it\u2019s too unsafe,\u201d one of them said as he drove the foreigners back to the heavily patrolled center of the city. \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/world/asia/20xinjiang.html", "title": "Countering Riots, China Rounds Up Hundreds", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}

Several hard-line members of the Iranian Parliament went even further, demanding that Iran pull out of the nonproliferation treaty and stop complying with international inspections under the agreement.\nOn Saturday, Mr. Salehi sought to assure that Iran had no interest in pulling out of the treaty, and he implied that any other suggestion was an attempt by Western countries to force Iran into a corner. \u201cI think the West is trying to force us out of the N.P.T.,\u201d he was quoted as saying on the Press TV Web site.\nThe speaker of Iran\u2019s Parliament, Ali Larijani, also urged moderation on Saturday, saying that the government should not be \u201cpushed into hasty reactions,\u201d the ISNA news agency quoted him as saying. \u201cYou should demand that authorities use all possible ways to serve national interests,\u201d he said.\nMr. Larijani characterized the United Nations nuclear agency\u2019s resolution as a \u201clight move\u201d that had then brought an \u201cinitial reaction\u201d by Iran.\nNuclear analysts viewed Iran\u2019s assertion that it would go ahead with 10 new enrichment facilities as not immediately achievable, as its main enrichment site at Natanz is still not fully operational after years of work.\nStill, the claim was seen in part as an attempt by the Iranian government to bolster its insistence that its nuclear program is geared toward generating electricity rather than creating nuclear weapons. That is because the Natanz site by itself is inadequate to fuel a nuclear reactor, but could still produce enough nuclear material for bombs, Western experts say.\nMr. Salehi seemed to be addressing some of that skepticism on Saturday. He said that the government might end up needing as many as 20 enrichment facilities down the road to meet its electricity demand.\n\u201cWe are in need of 20,000 megawatts,\u201d he said, adding that that would require roughly 20 times the amount of enriched uranium that the Natanz facility can now produce, roughly 30 tons per year.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/middleeast/06iran.html", "title": "Iran Will Not Quit Treaty, Its Nuclear Chief Asserts", "author": "NAZILA FATHI"}

She has repeatedly suggested that the money was a political donation.\nThe case against Ms. Wu is part of a complex web of charges that have captivated this island of 23 million people for months. They have seen her husband, former President Chen Shui-bian, stage a jailhouse hunger strike, her daughter lash out at the news media and her son plead guilty to other corruption charges.\nMs. Wu\u2019s appearance was her first in court since proceedings against her began in December 2006. She fainted early on in that session and was rushed to a Taipei hospital.\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Wu, who has been paralyzed since she was hit by a truck in 1985, arrived in a wheelchair, looking wan in an orange Burberry jacket and light gray trousers. After the session was adjourned, she told reporters that she regretted the upheaval her case had caused.\n\u201cI apologize for involving several innocent family members,\u201d she said, adding, \u201calso for causing turmoil in Taiwan society.\u201d\nIn December, Mr. Chen became the first former president to be indicted in Taiwan when he and more than 10 family members and aides were charged with various acts of corruption. He was charged with money laundering, forging documents, taking bribes and embezzlement, and spent 32 days in jail pending the completion of the investigation.\nOn Jan. 19 he pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.\nTwo days later, the couple\u2019s son, Chen Chih-chung, pleaded guilty to money laundering, as did their daughter-in-law and Ms. Wu\u2019s brother.\nHou Han-chun, a political scientist at National Taipei University, said Ms. Wu\u2019s insistence that large sums of money in her possession had come from political donations would make a bribery conviction difficult. \u201cProsecutors must prove that she sought to influence her husband after taking the money, and that will be pretty difficult,\u201d he said.\nTaiwan\u2019s brutally effervescent media, including six 24-hour cable television news stations, have chronicled every twist and turn of the case, fanning public interest. A favorite target has been the couple\u2019s daughter, Chen Hsing-yu, who has frequently lashed out at television reporters, most recently in New York.\nMr. Chen engaged in a 16-day jail hunger strike to buttress his claims that his successor was persecuting him to curry favor with China.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/world/asia/11taiwan.html", "title": "Former First Lady of Taiwan Admits Laundering $2.2 Million", "author": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}

This is a lottery,\u201d he said, according to the reports.\nCrew members of the ship, the Alakrana, had pleaded with their relatives on Thursday to press the Spanish government to do more to gain their release.\nThe relatives said that during telephone calls placed from the Alakrana, a 100-meter tuna-fishing vessel held off the Somali coast, captives briefly described their plight and said the pirates had followed through on their threat to start taking captives ashore. There are 16 Spaniards among a crew of 36.\nFamily members said the crew spoke at gunpoint, adding that they could hear in the background the explosion of a grenade that had been lobbed at a Spanish Navy frigate and shots fired into the air. The Spanish defense minister, Carme Chac\u00f3n, confirmed that a grenade had been thrown at the frigate but said that it had caused no damage or injuries. She said the pirates were using the relatives\u2019 anguish to gain the upper hand.\nThe Alakrana was hijacked in international waters off Somalia on Oct. 2. The next day, Spanish Special Forces captured two of the pirates as they headed to shore in a small boat.\nThe pirates are demanding that Spain release those two, who have since been arraigned and await trial in Spain charged with 36 counts of kidnapping, with each carrying a penalty of as much as five years, as well as armed assault.\nIn the phone calls Thursday, crew members told their relatives that the pirates would hand over three colleagues taken ashore to the relatives of the two Somali men jailed in Spain. The three men have not been identified.\n\u201cMy husband said we have to pressure the government because they have done this all wrong,\u201d said Silvia Alb\u00e9s, 32, wife of Pablo Costas, 33, from her home in Gondomar. \u201cThe pirates are furious because they haven\u2019t released the other two pirates here, and they\u2019ve said they won\u2019t negotiate until they do.\u201d\nMs. Alb\u00e9s said in a telephone interview that had she spoken for two minutes with her husband. \u201cThey have no food and very little water left,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPablo is panicking. He\u2019s terrorized. He wants to come home, and the government is not doing anything.\u201d\nSeveral other relatives of those being held strongly criticized the government through radio and television stations, accusing it of negligence, and even of blocking a negotiated solution.\nMs. Chac\u00f3n, the defense minister, defended the government\u2019s handling and said its priority was the well-being of the crew. She also said officials knew exactly where the three sailors were being held. Two Spanish Navy frigates have been monitoring the Alakrana from a distance.\nCrew members on the Alakrana are being held separately, said Juan Vieites, who is president of Euroatun, the umbrella group representing the European tuna industry, and who has been in close contact with the government, negotiators and relatives of the kidnapped crew members.\nMr. Vieites also criticized the government\u2019s actions. \u201cThey should have given us military protection onboard, like the French do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should have never brought the pirates to Spain and treated them like Guant\u00e1namo terrorists.

But her reference to it in talks with an Arab state is noteworthy because it offered a foreign audience a glimpse into the calculations of the Obama administration.\nAmerican officials privately say an overture to Iran could pay off, no matter how it reacts. A positive response would be a breakthrough, while a rebuff could put Tehran on the defensive, potentially undermining the posturing of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at home and encouraging America\u2019s allies to intensify sanctions against the government.\nPressed for details on her comments about Iran, Mrs. Clinton declined to elaborate but said she told several Arab officials that the United States would \u201cconsult constantly\u201d with them on its policy toward Tehran.\nMrs. Clinton also sought to open a fresh American chapter in the Middle East, declaring to Arab and European leaders that the United States was \u201ccommitted to a comprehensive peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors\u201d and would \u201cpursue it on many fronts.\u201d\nThe United States pledged more than $900 million in aid to the Palestinians, $300 million of which is relief for Gaza. The donors\u2019 conference, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik, raised nearly $4.5 billion, according to the Egyptian government, which acted as host.\nMrs. Clinton did not signal any shifts in American policy, but the broad scope of her remarks suggested that the Obama administration was open to new approaches toward the intractable problems of the region.\n\u201cWe are reaching out to determine what, if any, areas of cooperation and engagement are productive, and that includes Syria,\u201d she said at a news conference at the end of the meeting. In expressing her commitment to peace, Mrs. Clinton invoked her background as an advocate for children and the efforts of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to broker a peace deal. \u201cThis is something that is in my heart, not just my portfolio,\u201d she said to applause from a room of Arab journalists.\nBut Mrs. Clinton can go only so far. On delicate issues \u2014 like whether to deal with a Palestinian government that includes the militant group Hamas \u2014 the United States is yet not ready to shift course.\nMrs. Clinton reaffirmed that the United States would deal only with a Palestinian unity government that renounced terrorism and recognized the right of Israel to exist. That would clearly exclude Hamas, which, she noted, continues to launch rockets at Israeli towns.\nThe American aid money, she said, would go only to the Palestinian Authority and would have strings attached to guarantee that it \u201cdoes not end up in the wrong hands\u201d \u2014 another reference to Hamas.\nSome European countries are more receptive to dealing with a unity government that would include Hamas. Europeans have also pressed Israel harder than has the United States to open border crossings to Gaza, something it has refused to do for fear of strengthening Hamas.\nHamas has demanded the opening of the crossings as part of negotiations for a truce with Israel. Israel is insisting on an end to rocket fire from Gaza, a halt to weapons smuggling and the release of a captive Israeli soldier.\nAfter a day of meetings, European officials seemed convinced that the United States would increase its pressure on Israel during Mrs. Clinton\u2019s talks with Israeli leaders here on Tuesday.\n\u201cShe will certainly make the case for that, that we are making,\u201d said Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European commissioner for external relations. \u201cWe are not yet satisfied with the openings.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton said later that she would only raise specific issues with the next Israeli government. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud leader who is putting together that government, may end up with a narrow right-wing coalition that would be reluctant to loosen border controls.\nThe head of the United Nations Development Program in Gaza, Khaled Abdel Shafi, expressed worries about how much of the aid would actually reach people. \u201cThe problem is not only with the money,\u201d he said, \u201cbut with the siege, cease-fire and national reconciliation.\u201d\nDuring her meetings with Palestinian leaders in the West Bank on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton is likely to hear anger over Israel\u2019s continuing construction of settlements on occupied land there.\nNearly 300,000 Israelis live in such settlements, in addition to another 250,000 in East Jerusalem, also on land captured in the 1967 war. The Palestinians hope to build their state on that land and argue that settlement building drives that goal further and further away.\nPeace Now, an Israeli advocacy group that opposes the settlements, issued a report on Monday alleging that tens of thousands of new housing units were in the planning stage.\nThe report, clearly issued to coincide with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s arrival, said some 6,000 new units had been approved and another 58,000 were awaiting approval. \u201cIf all the plans are realized,\u201d the report said, \u201cthe number of settlers in the territories will be doubled.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/world/middleeast/03diplo.html", "title": "Clinton Not Optimistic About Iran-U.S. Thaw", "author": "MARK LANDLER"}
{"date": "Sun, 22 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BARA, Pakistan \u2014 More than 70 United States military advisers and technical specialists are secretly working in Pakistan to help its armed forces battle Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the country\u2019s lawless tribal areas, American military officials said.\nThe Americans are mostly Army Special Forces soldiers who are training Pakistani Army and paramilitary troops, providing them with intelligence and advising on combat tactics, the officials said. They do not conduct combat operations, the officials added.\nThey make up a secret task force, overseen by the United States Central Command and Special Operations Command. It started last summer, with the support of Pakistan\u2019s government and military, in an effort to root out Qaeda and Taliban operations that threaten American troops in Afghanistan and are increasingly destabilizing Pakistan. It is a much larger and more ambitious effort than either country has acknowledged.\nPakistani officials have vigorously protested American missile strikes in the tribal areas as a violation of sovereignty and have resisted efforts by Washington to put more troops on Pakistani soil. President Asif Ali Zardari, who leads a weak civilian government, is trying to cope with soaring anti-Americanism among Pakistanis and a belief that he is too close to Washington.\nDespite the political hazards for Islamabad, the American effort is beginning to pay dividends.\nA new Pakistani commando unit within the Frontier Corps paramilitary force has used information from the Central Intelligence Agency and other sources to kill or capture as many as 60 militants in the past seven months, including at least five high-ranking commanders, a senior Pakistani military official said.\nFour weeks ago, the commandos captured a Saudi militant linked to Al Qaeda here in this town in the Khyber Agency, one of the tribal areas that run along the border with Afghanistan.\nYet the main commanders of the Pakistani Taliban, including its leader, Baitullah Mehsud, and its leader in the Swat region, Maulana Fazlullah, remain at large. And senior American military officials remain frustrated that they have been unable to persuade the chief of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, to embrace serious counterinsurgency training for the army itself.\nGeneral Kayani, who is visiting Washington this week as a White House review on policy for Afghanistan and Pakistan gets under way, will almost certainly be asked how the Pakistani military can do more to eliminate Al Qaeda and the Taliban from the tribal areas.\nThe American officials acknowledge that at the very moment when Washington most needs Pakistan\u2019s help, the greater tensions between Pakistan and India since the terrorist attacks in Mumbai last November have made the Pakistani Army less willing to shift its attention to the Qaeda and Taliban threat.\nOfficials from both Pakistan and the United States agreed to disclose some details about the American military advisers and the enhanced intelligence sharing to help dispel impressions that the missile strikes were thwarting broader efforts to combat a common enemy. They spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the increasingly powerful anti-American segment of the Pakistani population.\nThe Pentagon had previously said about two dozen American trainers conducted training in Pakistan late last year. More than half the members of the new task force are Special Forces advisers; the rest are combat medics, communications experts and other specialists. Both sides are encouraged by the new collaboration between the American and Pakistani military and intelligence agencies against the militants.\n\u201cThe intelligence sharing has really improved in the past few months,\u201d said Talat Masood, a retired army general and a military analyst. \u201cBoth sides realize it\u2019s in their common interest.\u201d\nIntelligence from Pakistani informants has been used to bolster the accuracy of missile strikes from remotely piloted Predator and Reaper aircraft against the militants in the tribal areas, officials from both countries say.\nMore than 30 attacks by the aircraft have been conducted since last August, most of them after President Zardari took office in September. A senior American military official said that 9 of 20 senior Qaeda and Taliban commanders in Pakistan had been killed by those strikes.\nIn addition, a small team of Pakistani air defense controllers working in the United States Embassy in Islamabad ensures that Pakistani F-16 fighter-bombers conducting missions against militants in the tribal areas do not mistakenly hit remotely piloted American aircraft flying in the same area or a small number of C.I.A. operatives on the ground, a second senior Pakistani officer said.\nThe newly minted 400-man Pakistani paramilitary commando unit is a good example of the new cooperation. As part of the Frontier Corps, which operates in the tribal areas, the new Pakistani commandos fall under a chain of command separate from the 500,000-member army, which is primarily trained to fight Pakistan\u2019s archenemy, India.\nThe commandos are selected from the overall ranks of the Frontier Corps and receive seven months of intensive training from Pakistani and American Special Forces.\nThe C.I.A. helped the commandos track the Saudi militant linked to Al Qaeda, Zabi al-Taifi, for more than a week before the Pakistani forces surrounded his safe house in the Khyber Agency. The Pakistanis seized him, along with seven Pakistani and Afghan insurgents, in a dawn raid on Jan. 22, with a remotely piloted C.I.A. plane hovering overhead and personnel from the C.I.A. and Pakistan\u2019s main spy service closely monitoring the mission, a senior Pakistani officer involved in the operation said.\nStill, there are tensions between the sides. Pakistani F-16\u2019s conduct about a half-dozen combat missions a day against militants, but Pakistani officers say they could do more if the Pentagon helped upgrade the jets to fight at night and provided satellite-guided bombs and updated satellite imagery.\nGeneral Kayani was expected to take a long shopping list for more transport and combat helicopters to Washington. The question of more F-16\u2019s \u2014 which many in Congress assert are intended for the Indian front \u2014 will also come up, Pakistani officials said.\nThe United States missile strikes, which have resulted in civilian casualties, have stirred heated debate among senior Pakistani government and military officials, despite the government\u2019s private support for the attacks.\nOne American official described General Kayani, who is known to be sensitive about the necessity of public support for the army, as very concerned that the American strikes had undermined the army\u2019s authority.\n\u201cThese strikes are counterproductive,\u201d Owais Ahmed Ghani, the governor of North-West Frontier Province, said in an interview in his office in Peshawar. \u201cThis is looking for a quick fix, when all it will do is attract more jihadis.\u201d\nPakistani Army officers say the American strikes draw retaliation against Pakistani troops in the tribal areas, whose convoys and bases are bombed or attacked with rockets after each United States missile strike.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/world/asia/23terror.html", "title": "U.S. Unit Secretly in Pakistan Lends Ally Support", "author": "ERIC SCHMITT and JANE PERLEZ"}
{"date": "Fri, 25 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran was all bluster on Friday afternoon as he made light of the Western accusation that the Islamic republic had been caught hiding another crucial piece of its nuclear development program. \u201cThey probably thought they had some winning card here,\u201d he said dismissively at a Midtown Manhattan news conference.\nDespite the bold facade, Iranian officials are probably less sanguine: The revelations accented the problem Mr. Ahmadinejad and his government already faced in gaining acceptance months after a messy presidential election.\nAccusations that the June election was stolen have lingered, along with continuing demonstrations and serious allegations that arrested protesters were murdered, raped and tortured.\nWhile Mr. Ahmadinejad always seems to revel in the spotlight at the United Nations General Assembly, this year it must have seemed more important to counter the domestic turmoil.\nThen came the revelation that Iran had been hiding nuclear centrifuges in a mountain near the holy city of Qum. Suddenly Washington and its allies had added leverage to their demand, previously spurned, that Iran accept a tougher inspections regime.\nThe great powers appeared lined up against Mr. Ahmadinejad with the dramatic revelation, seeming to recruit Russia among their ranks and forcing him into spin mode.\nSeated at a green dais and flanked by red bouquets, Mr. Ahmadinejad said that with the new accusations, the outside powers thought that with their winning card \u201cthey could kind of make some noise and start commanding, \u2018Iran must do this and that.\u2019 \u201d\nHe asserted that Iran was fully in compliance with the reporting regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency and invited the agency to inspect the nuclear enrichment plant.\nTehran\u2019s stance hinges on different interpretations of the agency\u2019s regulations, said Graham Allison, the director of Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center and an Iran nuclear expert.\nFor two decades, the agency required Iran to report only when nuclear material was introduced to a facility. By 2003 it rescinded that, in line with the guidelines for most countries, demanding reporting when construction began, Mr. Allison said. But the agency never declared Iran out of compliance when Tehran claimed the old agreement was still in place.\nThe political difficulty for Mr. Ahmadinejad, deepened by the domestic crisis, is to keep three plates spinning in the air simultaneously. Signs of ending Iran\u2019s isolation might placate some protesters. But if he wanders away from the Islamic republic\u2019s longstanding confrontational stance toward the West, he could alienate his conservative base.\nYet he has to offer enough to quiet Western demands for transparency to prove that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons.\n\u201cThis is the contradiction,\u201d said Mohsen Sazegara, a founder of the Revolutionary Guards living in exile in the United States. \u201cThey need the international community, especially the United States, to say we are established, we are legitimate,\u201d he said.\nBut the Americans are likely to insist on stricter adherence to inspections established under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, including an additional protocol that allows for more intrusive inspections of possible nuclear facilities.\nIf the Iranians sign the protocol they will look even weaker domestically because they have been railing against it for years, Mr. Sazegara and other analysts said, but if they do not sign it they will face further economic sanctions and lose the chance to gain international approval.\nWestern leaders, particularly President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, demanded during a special Security Council session on nonproliferation that Iran provide solid assurances that its nuclear program was not for weapons. Top officials said the revelation would help. \u201cIt\u2019s like further grist in the mill that they have a long way to go to regain the credibility of the international community,\u201d David Miliband, the British foreign secretary, said in an interview.\nBan Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, added a rare rebuke of a member state in a statement issued after meeting with Mr. Ahmadinejad late Friday. He expressed concern about the new uranium enrichment facility, the human rights situation and the president\u2019s repeated denials of the Holocaust. Iran should accept a visit by a human rights rapporteur, he said.\nMr. Ahmadinejad was dismissive at his news conference, although he said several times that he hoped the American president would stick to his vision of a United States that consults rather than confronts.\n\u201cMr. Sarkozy and Mr. Brown are not very important to us,\u201d he said. When a reporter quoted President Obama as saying the new centrifuge site seemed inconsistent with a peaceful program, Mr. Ahmadinejad shot back, \u201cI don\u2019t think Mr. Obama is a nuclear expert.\u201d\nAsked if Iran had yet more hidden nuclear sites, Mr. Ahmadinejad repeated his position that Iran complies with reporting to the I.A.E.A. The reporters called on did not press Mr. Ahmadinejad \u2014 none asked whether Iran tried to make a pre-emptive revelation because it learned that the United States was about to, nor what transparency measures Iran was prepared to bring to next week\u2019s talks.\nThe revelation will make the talks, the first in a year, even more fraught. Expectations of any breakthrough became even more muted as no Iranian government, and particularly not this one, can seem to cave to outside pressure.\n\u201cExpectations ought to be pretty low,\u201d said one Iran analyst, speaking anonymously because he still travels there. \u201cThe best outcome for the first meeting is that there is a second meeting. If the vulnerability gets them to a second meeting, that is success.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/world/middleeast/26iran.html", "title": "Iran\u2019s Leader Mocks West\u2019s Accusations", "author": "NEIL MacFARQUHAR"}

It was China\u2019s first official accounting of the number of people killed by the police and paramilitary troops during the chaos in Urumqi, the capital of the restive Xinjiang region.\nNur Bekri, the governor of Xinjiang, said police officers had shot and killed the 12 people after first firing into the air, Xinhua reported Sunday. Mr. Bekri, who called the shooting victims \u201cmobsters\u201d and \u201cthugs,\u201d did not identify their ethnicity. Chinese officials rarely give an accounting of people killed or injured by security forces during episodes deemed politically delicate.\nIn the past two weeks, talk has spread quickly among ethnic Uighurs in Urumqi that Chinese security forces killed many Uighurs during the rioting, fueling anger toward the government.\nFurthermore, many residents of Urumqi are denouncing the police and the local government for failing to halt the violence even though government officials say they knew beforehand that a protest was going to take place.\nAt least 197 people were killed and 1,721 were injured during several hours of ethnic bloodletting in Urumqi on July 5, officials say. The vast majority of the victims, according to the government, were ethnic Han civilians who were pummeled or stabbed to death by young Uighurs. In many cases, the heads of the Han victims were bashed in with sticks and stones.\nThe Han are the dominant ethnic group in China, but the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking ethnic group of mostly Sunni Muslims, are the largest ethnic group in Xinjiang. Many Uighurs say they face intense discrimination throughout Xinjiang.\nUighurs in Urumqi say the government has underestimated the number of Uighurs killed by security forces, and they assert that many Uighurs were killed by roving bands of Han vigilantes in the days that followed the rioting on July 5.\nThe government has given no estimate for the number of people killed or wounded in the revenge attacks. Hospital officials in Urumqi have generally declined to allow foreign reporters to interview injured Uighurs, but they have allowed them to interview injured Han.\nThe Chinese government insists the attacks were organized and points to Rebiya Kadeer, an exiled Uighur businesswoman living in the Washington D.C. area, as the orchestrator. She has denied the charge.\nThe government said through a Xinhua report on Sunday that violence had broken out in 50 locations around Urumqi by 9 p.m. on July 5. The government also said that the rioters appeared to have prepared caches of simple weapons in advance, and that women in black robes and headscarves issued \u201ccommands\u201d to followers.\nThough surveillance cameras are used to monitor the major avenues and plazas in Urumqi, the government has not released any tape from those cameras to show what actually happened on July 5.\nAn American teacher living in the Uighur quarter, Adam Grode, said in an interview that much of the violence he witnessed appeared to be spontaneous. He said clashes began after 7 p.m. when rock-throwing Uighur men and paramilitary troops with batons attacked each other as the troops were trying to contain a protest.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like there was anything organized about it,\u201d Mr. Grode said.\nGovernment officials also say that the police knew as early as 1 a.m. on July 5 that Uighurs were going to hold a protest in the city center. But angry Han residents say that there were few police officers in the heart of the Uighur bazaar during the rioting, and that police officers did not show up in many of the worst-hit neighborhoods until five hours after the killings began.\nBy then it was too late.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/world/asia/21china.html", "title": "China Says Its Forces Killed 12 in Xinjiang", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

Judge M. L. Tahiliyani said the lawyer, Anjali Waghmare, could not represent him because she was also representing a witness to the attacks in a separate civil proceeding.\nThe judge said another lawyer would have to be appointed for Mr. Kasab, though it was unclear how soon that would happen.\nMr. Kasab, 21, was arrested in late November after 10 gunmen killed more than 160 people in luxury hotels, a Jewish center and a busy railroad station. The attacks heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, which have fought several wars since they became independent in 1947.\nThe trial, in which prosecutors have charged Mr. Kasab with 12 crimes, including murder and waging war against India, had previously been delayed because of security concerns. The government has significantly increased security, including building a bomb-proof courtroom and installing a teleconference system through which the judge has previously talked to Mr. Kasab.\nThe start of the trial on Wednesday was the first time Mr. Kasab had been seen in public since he was arrested. He was barefoot and wore a T-shirt and blue sports pants.\nMr. Kasab asked the judge to appoint a Pakistani lawyer to represent him. The judge replied that a previous request had already been forwarded to Pakistani authorities but that there had been no response. Mr. Kasab asked him to try again.\nPakistan and India have been trading criticism over the investigation.

It was, she conceded, hard to say exactly when over the course of a very long evening the phone had disappeared, because the 139-pound, 22-year-old student drank nearly 10 pints of strong Oktoberfest beer.\n\u201cI\u2019d given up,\u201d said a visibly relieved Ms. Friedensburg, who found her phone \u2014 and more important, the phone numbers of all her friends \u2014 in one of the drawers, carefully segregated by manufacturer, next to the umbrella stand that also held a pair of crutches and a fishing rod waiting to be claimed. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have it in me to start over with everything,\u201d she said.\nMany festival visitors do not even realize that there is a central lost and found, run by the city workers who run Munich\u2019s year-round lost and found and reinforced by temps and interns from other departments. But the Fundb\u00fcro, as it is called in German, is locally famous for what has ended up there over the years, including a prosthetic leg, a wheelchair, a Superman costume, handwritten notes by the composer Johann Sebastian Bach and 15,000 marks in a soiled pair of lederhosen, eventually returned to the embarrassed owner who abandoned them.\nBut as the staff must tell teary-eyed teenage girls every year, they do not keep track of lost boyfriends.\nThe police, waiters and partygoers bring in the items discovered under the benches of the cavernous Oktoberfest tents, the biggest of which hold up to 10,000 singing, inebriated revelers. The half-dozen workers at the lost and found, some themselves clad in lederhosen and dirndls, peck away at old typewriters as they fill out the index cards detailing where and when the traditional Bavarian Janker jacket or brand-new iPhone was discovered, doing their best to bring order to disorder.\nOktoberfest proves that Germans can, in fact, loosen up and have fun. But they are going to have a system in place and prepare themselves for every eventuality first.\nPreparedness turned into an unexpectedly significant theme at this year\u2019s Oktoberfest after terrorist threats were made against the festival, part of an effort by Islamist militants to intimidate Germans over the country\u2019s troop presence in Afghanistan ahead of last Sunday\u2019s election. To discourage would-be attackers, the Munich police increased the number of officers to 700 from 400 and closed more streets around the party.\nBut the menacing intrusion of the outside world does not seem to have dampened the moods of visitors. Organizers estimated that in the first week of the two-week festival, which ends this Sunday, 3.3 million people, 100,000 more than in 2008, came to sample the products of the city\u2019s famous breweries like Paulaner, Augustiner and the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus. Among them they downed nearly a million gallons of beer.\nOktoberfest, which got its start with the marriage of Crown Prince Ludwig in 1810, is more than just an exercise in binge drinking and loud renditions of favorite songs like \u201cEin Prosit\u201d and, somewhat improbably, John Denver\u2019s \u201cCountry Roads.\u201d Children dash from roller coaster to carousel rides and families dig into heaping plates of ox and chicken. But the party mood is dominant.\nStrapping men in leather shorts with suspenders and brightly checked shirts and women in peasant dresses are ready to forget not just their troubles, but also their wallets and wedding rings, or as Stephan Weiler did, the keys to his apartment.\nLike one of the characters in the recent hit film \u201cThe Hangover,\u201d Mr. Weiler, 28, a bioengineer, was piecing the events of the previous evening together with the help of photographs on his digital camera. As he surveyed the white wall by the entrance studded with hooks bearing over a hundred keys, none of them his, he said he had not given up hope.\nEmployees said they were bracing for the coming final weekend, when thousands of people would descend on the lost and found to search for their missing objects, most operating under the false impression that it would be their last chance. In fact, the staff spends months working with consulates to return passports, banks to find the owners of A.T.M. cards and telephone companies to hand over the misplaced cellphones.\nAccording to Maik M\u00fcller, deputy director of the lost and found, while only a fifth of all the roughly 5,000 objects lost each year are reunited with their owners, the rate of return for cellphones and wallets was between 60 and 70 percent. The remainder are auctioned off to help cover expenses or given to charities.\nFor Sam Sealy, 19, from Bellevue, Wash., it was relatively easy to prove ownership, since his passport was in his gray and blue backpack. An alert staff member actually recognized him from his photograph before he even made it to the counter to inquire. Mr. Sealy, who came to Oktoberfest while studying abroad in the Czech Republic, could not believe his luck, that not only his bag had been found but also his passport, iPod, camera and two $100 bills.\nMr. Sealy had to sign forms and hand over $60 to get them back \u2014 the fee is 5 percent of the value of the goods up to $725 and 3 percent after \u2014 but he said it was worth it. Praising German efficiency, Mr. Sealy said, \u201cI\u2019m amazed I went to a lost and found and actually found what was missing. That never happens in America.\u201d\nThe stream of increasingly inebriated visitors as day turns to night can be trying for the staff at times. In one episode, a young man, unsteady on his feet, refused to leave but instead mumbled, \u201cNein, nein, nein,\u201d for several minutes, before resting his head on the counter and switching to his first name, \u201cMaximilian, Maximilian, Maximilian,\u201d as though it were an incantation to summon his lost wallet.\nAn equally distraught and intoxicated young American man was escorted to the police by Tobias Wenk, 35, who works full time in the main lost and found, to get him help canceling the credit cards in his lost wallet. \u201cWe finished canceling them,\u201d Mr. Wenk said upon returning to his station, \u201cand the wallet was in his pocket all along.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/world/europe/02octoberfest.html", "title": "Raise Your Mugs to German Efficiency!", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH"}
{"date": "Mon, 23 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 A slew of political scandals gripping Malaysia and a transfer of power fraught with uncertainty have shaken the elite here, with exquisitely poor timing.\nAs a major trading nation, Malaysia has been slammed by the global downturn. Its exports have collapsed by nearly one-third, and current projections show that its economy will shrink by as much as 5 percent this year.\nYet the main preoccupation of the government and opposition parties appears to be what analysts say is an increasingly dysfunctional political system. The man in line to become prime minister has been linked to the murder of a Mongolian woman whose body was obliterated with military-grade explosives.\nThe leader of the main opposition party awaits trial on sodomy charges, in a highly politicized case. The government is using draconian laws to prosecute other opposition figures, and last week it suspended a member of Parliament for one year after he called the prime-minister-in-waiting a murderer. And a state legislature has been paralyzed for six weeks by a dispute over who should govern.\n\u201cAt the rate things are going, we\u2019re going to be a failed state within a decade,\u201d said Salehuddin Hashim, secretary general of the People\u2019s Justice Party, the largest opposition party.\nFor Malaysia, an oil-rich country with a large, well-educated middle class, the pessimism may seem hyperbolic. But analysts say the current political woes strike at the heart of the functioning of government, damaging institutions like the royalty, the judiciary and the police.\n\u201cI see a rough ride ahead for the country,\u201d said Zaid Ibrahim, the founder of Malaysia\u2019s largest law firm, who resigned as law minister in September over the government\u2019s practice of detaining its critics without trial. \u201cThe institutions of government have become so one-sided it will take years to restore professionalism and integrity.\u201d\nMuch of the anxiety is focused on the rise of Najib Razak, a veteran politician in line to become prime minister sometime after the governing party\u2019s annual general assembly, which starts Tuesday. No date for his ascension has been set, and some Malaysians speculate that the incumbent, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, will hold on to power, though he has said he will step down.\nMr. Najib\u2019s supporters say he will reverse the sagging fortunes of the governing party, the United Malays National Organization, and offer decisive leadership, a contrast to the languid style of Mr. Abdullah. But Mr. Najib lacks popular support, and many expect further crackdowns on his opponents if he becomes prime minister. The government already seems to be taking a harder line, shutting two opposition newspapers on Monday while the police used tear gas to break up a rally by opposition leaders in the northern state of Kedah.\nIn a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Zaid called on the king, Mizan Zainal Abidin, to reject Mr. Najib if the party puts him forward as prime minister, and to appoint someone who would \u201cbring us back from the brink.\u201d\nMr. Najib declined to comment for this article.\nThe highest-profile scandal to tarnish his reputation is the murder of the Mongolian, Altantuya Shaariibuu, the mistress of Mr. Najib\u2019s foreign policy adviser.\nProsecutors say Ms. Shaariibuu was killed in October 2006 by government commandos who also serve as bodyguards to the country\u2019s top leaders.\nMr. Najib has not been charged with any crime, and he denies having known Ms. Shaariibuu or ever having met her.\nAccording to news accounts, Ms. Shaariibuu had been seeking her share of a commission \u2014 the opposition calls it a bribe \u2014 worth about $155 million, paid by a French company as part of a deal reached by the government to buy submarines. Mr. Najib, who is defense minister as well as deputy prime minister, handled the submarine purchase.\nThe huge size of the commission \u2014 about 10 percent of the total cost of the submarines \u2014 is not being investigated, despite an official acknowledgment by the Malaysian government that it was made to a company linked to Mr. Najib\u2019s aide, who was acquitted in connection with Ms. Shaariibuu\u2019s murder.\nLawyers say the handling of the case has been irregular, and they criticize the prosecution for failing to call Mr. Najib to testify at his aide\u2019s trial.\nPerhaps more worrying for the country is the standoff in Perak, a state where since early February the police have barred lawmakers who oppose the governing party from entering government buildings.\nMr. Najib spearheaded an effort to install a new chief minister in Perak by claiming that he had enough defectors from the opposition coalition, the Pakatan Rakyat, which last year took control of the State Assembly for the first time since the country won independence from Britain in 1957.\nBoth sides remain at an impasse, and the sultan of Perak has rejected a plea by the speaker of the Assembly for a new election, which polls indicate would probably restore the opposition coalition to power.\nIbrahim Suffian, director of the Merdeka Center, an independent polling agency, said that as the governing party\u2019s popularity wanes, Malaysia is failing a key test of any democracy: the peaceful transfer of power.\n\u201cMalaysian democracy hasn\u2019t fully matured, in the sense that those who lost the elections are unwilling to accept the results,\u201d he said. The United Malays National Organization has governed the country since independence but nearly lost power in elections last March, a watershed that put into question Malaysia\u2019s ethnic-based party system.\nMr. Zaid, the former law minister, traces Malaysia\u2019s current troubles to the privileges given to the country\u2019s dominant ethnic group, the Malays. Governments led by the United Malays National Organization have provided contracts, discounts and special quotas to Malays through a far-reaching program of preferences. \u201cWe have sacrificed democracy for the supremacy of one race,\u201d said Mr. Zaid, who himself is Malay. \u201cIt\u2019s a political hegemony.\u201d\nThe other two major ethnic groups, Chinese and Indian, have withdrawn support for the governing party in recent years and now largely back the opposition.\nDeclining support for the governing party has heightened the personal rivalry between Mr. Najib and Anwar Ibrahim, the opposition leader facing sodomy charges. In a measure of the political nature of the case, Mr. Anwar\u2019s accuser met with Mr. Najib before going to the police.\n\u201cOur position vis-\u00e0-vis Najib is clear,\u201d Mr. Anwar said in an interview. \u201cHe has become so repressive and crude in his methods.\u201d\nMr. Anwar added, \u201cThere\u2019s no way we will have any dealing or respect for him.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/world/asia/24malaysia.html", "title": "Scandals Cloud Succession in Newly Unsure Malaysia", "author": "THOMAS FULLER"}

It was 1956, and Mao Zedong was calling on China\u2019s youth to \u201copen up the west,\u201d the vast borderland known as Xinjiang that for centuries had defied subjugation.\nAfter a monthlong journey by train and open-air truck, thousands arrived at this Gobi Desert army outpost to find that the factory jobs, hot baths and telephones in every house were nothing but empty promises to lure them to a faraway land.\n\u201cWe lived in holes in the ground, and all we did night and day was hard labor,\u201d recalled Han Zuxue, a sun-creased 72-year-old who was a teenager when he left his home in eastern Henan Province. \u201cAt first we cried every day but over time we forgot our sadness.\u201d\nMore than five decades of toil later, men and women like Mr. Han have helped transform Shihezi into a tree-shaded, bustling oasis whose canned tomatoes, fiery grain alcohol and enormous cotton yields are famous throughout China.\nThis city of 650,000 is a showcase of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a uniquely Chinese conglomerate of farms and factories that were created by decommissioned Red Army soldiers at the end of the civil war.\n\u201cPut your weapons aside and pick up the tools of construction,\u201d one popular slogan went. \u201cDevelop Xinjiang, defend the nation\u2019s borders and protect social stability.\u201d\nWith a total population of 2.6 million, 95 percent of it ethnic Han Chinese, Shihezi and a string of other settlements created by the military are stable strongholds in a region whose majority non-Han populace has often been unhappy under Beijing\u2019s rule. Last month, that discontent showed itself during vicious ethnic rioting that claimed 197 lives in Urumqi, the regional capital, which is a two-hour drive away.\nThe government says that most of the dead were Han Chinese bludgeoned by mobs of Uighurs, Muslims of Turkish ancestry whose presence in Xinjiang has been steadily diluted by migration from China\u2019s densely populated east.\n\u201cEver since we arrived they\u2019ve resented us and had no appreciation for how we\u2019ve improved this place,\u201d said He Zhenjie, 76, who has spent his adult life leveling sand dunes, planting trees and digging irrigation ditches. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to stay. The Uighurs will never wrest Xinjiang away.\u201d\nEven if many Uighurs view the settlers as nothing more than Chinese colonists, many Chinese consider the bingtuan, meaning soldier corps, a major success. In one fell swoop Mao deployed 200,000 idle soldiers to help develop and occupy a resource-rich, politically strategic region bordering India, Mongolia and the Soviet Union, a onetime ally turned menace.\nShihezi and other bingtuan settlements quickly became self-sufficient, a relief to a government lacking resources, and its \u201creclamation warriors\u201d worked without pay those first few years, steadily turning thousands of acres of inhospitable scrubland into some of the country\u2019s most fertile terrain.\nWith an annual output of goods and services of $7 billion, the settlements run by the bingtuan include five cities, 180 farming communities and 1,000 companies. They also report directly to Beijing and run their own courts, colleges and newspapers.\n\u201cDuring peaceful times, they are a force for development, but if anything urgent happens, they will step out and maintain social stability and combat the separatists,\u201d said Li Sheng, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a former bingtuan member who writes about the region\u2019s history.\nIn those early years, the ranks of the bingtuan were fortified by petty criminals, former prisoners of war, prostitutes and intellectuals, all sent west for \u201cre-education.\u201d During the mid-1950s, 40,000 young women were lured to Xinjiang with promises of the good life: they arrived to discover their main purpose was to relieve the loneliness of the male pioneers and cement the region\u2019s Han presence through their progeny.\nDemographics have always been a tactical element of the campaign to pacify the region. In 1949, when the Communists declared the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China, there were just 300,000 Han Chinese in Xinjiang. Today, the number of Han has grown to 7.5 million, just over 40 percent of the region\u2019s population. The percentage of Uighurs has fallen to 45 percent, or about 8.3 million.\nTheir grievances have multiplied even as Xinjiang has grown more prosperous, thanks in part to its huge reserves of natural gas, oil and minerals. Many Uighurs complain about the repression of their Islamic faith, official policies that marginalize their language and a lack of job opportunities, especially at government bureaus and inside the bingtuan.\nDuring a recent visit to Shihezi, armed paramilitary policemen stopped every car and bus entering the city. But only Uighurs were made to step out of vehicles for identification checks and searches.\nNeatly laid out on a grid, its sidewalks graced by apple trees and elms, the city is populated by the sturdy and defiantly proud who think of Xinjiang as China\u2019s version of Manifest Destiny, the doctrine undergirding the westward expansion of the United States in the 19th century. But just beneath the self-satisfaction runs a deep vein of bitterness, especially among those who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\u201cI thought I was going to be a nurse, but I ended up sweeping the streets and cleaning toilets,\u201d said Yue Caiying, who moved here in 1963, and, like many of those with an education, was forced to set aside personal ambition.\nLu Yiping, an author who spent five years interviewing women trucked into Xinjiang from Hunan Province, tells of girls lured with promises of Russian-language classes and textile-mill jobs. In an interview published online, he told the story of arriving women greeted by Wang Zhen, the famously hard-line general who helped tame the region. \u201cComrades, you must prepare to bury your bones in Xinjiang,\u201d he quoted Mr. Wang as telling the women.\nStill, for many early settlers, Xinjiang offered an escape from the deprivation that stalked many rural areas between 1959 and 1962, when Mao\u2019s disastrous attempt to start up China\u2019s industrialization led to famine that killed millions.\nEarly settlers like Ma Xianwu, who arrived here in 1951 and helped dig the first thatch-covered pits that served as shelter, offer a typical mix of conflicted emotions. He expressed wonder at the city he had helped create, but also sorrow over the hardship he and others had endured.\n\u201cPeople would lose ears and toes to frostbite,\u201d said Mr. Ma, who is 94 and nearly toothless.\nBut any sense of bitterness has faded. \u201cWe were serving the motherland,\u201d he said, waving off the adulation of a visitor. \u201cThe glory belongs to the party. I\u2019m just one drop of water in the ocean.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/world/asia/07xinjiang.html", "title": "Migrants to China\u2019s West Bask in Prosperity", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}
{"date": "Mon, 03 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Little more than three weeks before the presidential election, problems that include insecurity and fears of fraud are raising concerns about the credibility of the race, which President Obama has called the most important event in Afghanistan this year.\nWith Taliban insurgents active in half the country, many Afghans remain doubtful that the Aug. 20 election will take place at all. The Taliban issued a statement last week calling for a boycott, a threat that could deter voters in much of the south, where the insurgency is strongest.\nElection officials insist that the election will go ahead. But they concede that the insecurity will prevent as many as 600 polling centers, or roughly 10 percent, from opening. Western officials acknowledge that the election will be imperfect, but say they are aiming for enough credibility to satisfy both Afghans and international monitors.\nEven that goal will be hard to meet. Though increasingly unpopular here and abroad, President Hamid Karzai is still the front-runner in a field of about 40 candidates, and only one, Abdullah Abdullah, a former foreign minister for Mr. Karzai, has emerged as a serious challenger. Many Afghans are convinced that foreign powers will choose the winner and fix the result.\nBut no matter who prevails, the multitude of problems and what is expected to be a low turnout in conflict areas are likely to reduce the next president\u2019s mandate.\nWestern officials and Afghans alike worry that the election could be so flawed that many Afghans might reject the balloting and its results, with potentially dangerous consequences.\nIf they cannot vote because of insecurity in the south, Pashtuns, the country\u2019s largest ethnic group and the one most closely associated with the Taliban, could become even more alienated from the government and the foreign forces backing it, political analysts say.\nThey also warn of Iranian-style protests and instability if the population in the north, which largely supports a change of government, feels its vote has been manipulated.\n\u201cWe are worried about voter registration fraud, and we are worried about voters who will be unable to reach polling places because of insecurity,\u201d Richard C. Holbrooke, the American special envoy, said during a visit last week. \u201cAnd we are worried about the accuracy of the vote count, and we are worried about the ability of women to vote.\u201d\nPhilippe Morillon, the outspoken retired French general who leads the European Union election observer mission to Afghanistan, said his top priority was to prevent fraud. \u201cIt is you who will choose your president, and we are there simply to guarantee that your choice is not betrayed,\u201d Mr. Morillon told Afghan journalists at a news briefing in Kabul.\nIn an effort to speed the results and reduce the opportunity for rigging, ballots will be counted at individual polling stations. Afghan officials have said there will be a preliminary result within 48 hours, followed by a two-week period for complaints and confirmation procedures.\nBut Western officials say it could take longer to declare a winner, anticipating challenges from around the country\u2019s 34 provinces, where votes will also be cast for provincial councils.\n\u201cIt could be like 34 Minnesota Senate races,\u201d one Western official said, referring to the disputed race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman, which took nearly eight months to resolve in Mr. Franken\u2019s favor.\nOther officials warn that public frustration with the war, corruption and lagging reconstruction and development is so high that many people may shun the polls.\nIn the south, election officials said they were expecting a turnout below 30 percent, said Abdul Qader Nurzai, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission office in Kandahar.\n\u201cThe people are not that interested in the elections,\u201d said Abdul Hadi, the election commissioner in the adjoining province of Helmand, where thousands of Marines have been deployed to regain towns from the Taliban in time for the elections.\n\u201cThey voted before, and they did not see any result from that,\u201d Mr. Hadi said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t want to put their lives in jeopardy for one vote.\u201d An estimated 70 percent of Afghan voters turned out for the country\u2019s first presidential election, in October 2004.\nIn Helmand, in southern Afghanistan, the election will take place only in safe zones in the main towns, Mr. Hadi said. One third of districts are under Taliban control and will not be able to take part, he said. In some districts, like Kajaki, the Taliban have besieged administrative centers and will not allow civilians in to vote, he said.\nIn the eastern Paktika Province, which borders Pakistan\u2019s lawless tribal areas, more than 20 percent of the voting centers will have to be moved or abandoned because of security, officials said.\nAfghan election officials in the capital, Kabul, insist that voters will turn out. About 4.5 million people registered for new voting cards this year, far exceeding expectations, said Azizullah Ludin, the election commission chief.\nYet irregularities are widespread. As many as 3 million duplicate voter registration cards may be circulating among the 17 million issued, according to one election observer, who asked not to be named because of the delicacy of the subject.\nTwenty percent of the new cards went to under-age boys and another 20 percent were duplicates, an Afghan election observer organization, the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan, found in the centers it was able to monitor.\nFor security and cultural reasons, women\u2019s registration has been low. Yet the number of registered women exceeded the number of registered men in some areas, indicating more irregularities. Male family members were able to obtain voting cards for women simply by providing a list of women\u2019s names, the Afghan election monitors reported in May.\nThis election is unlike Afghanistan\u2019s first presidential contest five years ago in that most balloting and monitoring is being run by Afghans, with only a small number of international advisers and observers, most prominently the 120-member mission from the European Union.\nSo far, the Taliban have generally refrained from specific attacks on the election process or on voters, and have even agreed to allow voting to take place in some areas.\nYet violence has increased, and in some places the Taliban are ordering communities not to take part. In a rambling statement issued Thursday through a spokesman, the Taliban leadership urged people to boycott and fighters to sabotage the process.\n\u201cWe are requesting all mujahedeen to do their best to sabotage the malicious election process anywhere in Afghanistan,\u201d it said. \u201cThey should carry out operations on enemy bases, and ban people from going to vote one day before the election.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/world/asia/04election.html", "title": "Fears of Fraud Cast Pall Over Afghan Election", "author": "CARLOTTA GALL"}
{"date": "Fri, 18 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama had hoped to go to his first United Nations meeting next week with at least one diplomatic coup: a plan to restart the long-stalled Middle East peace talks, to be announced in a three-way meeting with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\nBut after a fruitless week of shuttle diplomacy, his special envoy, George J. Mitchell, returned to the United States on Friday night without an agreement on freezing construction of Jewish settlements and amid fresh signs of differences on the basis for peace negotiations. Mr. Obama now faces the prospect of a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, that some say will be little more than a photo opportunity, one that will only underscore how elusive an Arab-Israeli peace agreement is.\nThe failure of Mr. Mitchell to nail down an agreement with Israel on freezing settlements, which the administration views as vital for successful talks, does not mean that Mr. Obama will not ultimately succeed. Some experts predict that Mr. Netanyahu, a shrewd negotiator, will strike a deal directly with the president, though that seems unlikely to happen before world leaders gather Wednesday for the United Nations General Assembly.\nBut Mr. Mitchell\u2019s travails \u2014 he also faces resistance from Arab countries in making diplomatic gestures toward Israel \u2014 show that on yet another front Mr. Obama\u2019s policy of engagement is proving to be a hard sell. If an agreement just to start talking is out of reach, hammering out the details of a comprehensive peace deal seems all the more daunting.\nDuring his weeklong visit to the Middle East, people briefed on the talks said, Mr. Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader, found substantial differences between the sides, even on issues that had been agreed upon in previous negotiations, like the basic configuration of Israel\u2019s borders and whether the status of Jerusalem should be included in peace talks.\nThe State Department declined to comment on the details of Mr. Mitchell\u2019s discussions, though a spokesman, Ian C. Kelly, acknowledged that the trip had failed to produce a breakthrough.\n\u201cOf course we hoped to have an agreement,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cOf course we were hoping for some kind of breakthrough. But this is going to be \u2014 again, it\u2019s going to be \u2014 it\u2019s going to demand a lot of patience. And the U.S. is ready to stay patient and stay engaged.\u201d\nOther senior administration officials say they do not view their inability to announce a new round of talks next week as a setback. They say that Mr. Obama expected this to be a lengthy, grueling process, and that Mr. Mitchell has already moved Mr. Netanyahu a long way toward accepting some form of freeze and Arab countries toward considering conciliatory measures toward Israel.\n\u201cGiven the situation we confronted in January 2009, the amount of progress Senator Mitchell has made in nine months is remarkable,\u201d said a White House spokesman, Tommy Vietor.\nIn a speech Friday at the Brookings Institution, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said, \u201cI can guarantee you that President Obama and I are very patient and very determined.\u201d\nStill, it was telling that in listing the Obama administration\u2019s priorities for the General Assembly, Mrs. Clinton did not even mention the Middle East, focusing instead on nuclear nonproliferation, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, among other issues. She mentioned the need for a \u201ccomprehensive peace between Israel and the Palestinians\u201d at the end of a wide-ranging address.\nAmerican and Palestinian officials said there were two sets of problems, the first dealing with the length and extent of an Israeli settlement freeze in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and the second dealing with the basis for the negotiations themselves.\n\u201cIf one or the other had worked, if the freeze had been broader or if the terms for negotiation had been broader, that would have been enough to get the ball rolling,\u201d a senior American official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. \u201cBut with gaps over both, we have to keep working.\u201d\nMr. Mitchell met twice on Friday with Mr. Netanyahu after two meetings with Mr. Abbas. An aide to Mr. Netanyahu said that Israel was willing to restart negotiations immediately, so the difficulty lay not with Israel but with the Palestinians.\nThe Netanyahu aide said that the gaps involved not only what Israel could give \u2014 a settlement freeze and agreeing that a two-state solution would be based on certain borders \u2014 but also what Arab states would give in return as confidence-building measures. The United States is pushing Arab countries to allow Israel to reopen trade missions in those countries and to allow Israeli airlines to fly over their territory.\nThe Americans and Palestinians have been pushing Israel to agree to freeze settlement building entirely as evidence of its seriousness about peace talks. The settlements are on land that the Palestinians want for their future state. But Mr. Netanyahu has declined to do so, saying only that he would be willing to reduce or slow building.\nHe plans to finish construction on 2,500 units and recently authorized starting another 500.\nSaeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said that without a freeze in advance, negotiations were pointless.\nIf Mr. Obama does go ahead with a meeting at the United Nations, officials said he would push both sides hard to yield more. But they predicted that Mr. Mitchell would have to continue his shuttles.\n\u201cThey can have a photo opportunity, but they can\u2019t announce the resumption of talks,\u201d Mr. Erekat said by phone after Mr. Mitchell\u2019s meeting with Mr. Abbas. \u201cThey will try again next month.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/world/middleeast/19diplo.html", "title": "Lack of Progress in Mideast Defies Obama\u2019s Hopes", "author": "MARK LANDLER and ETHAN BRONNER"}
{"date": "Tue, 01 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "Following is the text of President Obama's address on a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, as released by the White House on Tuesday:\nGood evening. To the United States Corps of Cadets, to the men and women of our Armed Services, and to my fellow Americans: I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan -- the nature of our commitment there, the scope of our interests, and the strategy that my administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion. It's an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point -- where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security, and to represent what is finest about our country.\nTo address these important issues, it's important to recall why America and our allies were compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place. We did not ask for this fight. On September 11, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people. They struck at our military and economic nerve centers. They took the lives of innocent men, women, and children without regard to their faith or race or station. Were it not for the heroic actions of passengers onboard one of those flights, they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington, and killed many more.\nAs we know, these men belonged to al Qaeda -- a group of extremists who have distorted and defiled Islam, one of the world's great religions, to justify the slaughter of innocents. Al Qaeda's base of operations was in Afghanistan, where they were harbored by the Taliban -- a ruthless, repressive and radical movement that seized control of that country after it was ravaged by years of Soviet occupation and civil war, and after the attention of America and our friends had turned elsewhere.\nJust days after 9/11, Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those who harbored them -- an authorization that continues to this day. The vote in the Senate was 98 to nothing. The vote in the House was 420 to 1. For the first time in its history, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization invoked Article 5 -- the commitment that says an attack on one member nation is an attack on all. And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of all necessary steps to respond to the 9/11 attacks. America, our allies and the world were acting as one to destroy al Qaeda's terrorist network and to protect our common security.\nUnder the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy -- and only after the Taliban refused to turn over Osama bin Laden -- we sent our troops into Afghanistan. Within a matter of months, al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed. The Taliban was driven from power and pushed back on its heels. A place that had known decades of fear now had reason to hope. At a conference convened by the U.N., a provisional government was established under President Hamid Karzai. And an International Security Assistance Force was established to help bring a lasting peace to a war-torn country.\nThen, in early 2003, the decision was made to wage a second war, in Iraq. The wrenching debate over the Iraq war is well-known and need not be repeated here. It's enough to say that for the next six years, the Iraq war drew the dominant share of our troops, our resources, our diplomacy, and our national attention -- and that the decision to go into Iraq caused substantial rifts between America and much of the world.\nToday, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end. We will remove our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of next summer, and all of our troops by the end of 2011. That we are doing so is a testament to the character of the men and women in uniform. (Applause.) Thanks to their courage, grit and perseverance, we have given Iraqis a chance to shape their future, and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people.\nBut while we've achieved hard-earned milestones in Iraq, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002, al Qaeda's leadership established a safe haven there. Although a legitimate government was elected by the Afghan people, it's been hampered by corruption, the drug trade, an under-developed economy, and insufficient security forces.\nOver the last several years, the Taliban has maintained common cause with al Qaeda, as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghan government. Gradually, the Taliban has begun to control additional swaths of territory in Afghanistan, while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating attacks of terrorism against the Pakistani people.\nNow, throughout this period, our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what they were in Iraq. When I took office, we had just over 32,000 Americans serving in Afghanistan, compared to 160,000 in Iraq at the peak of the war. Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban, but these reinforcements did not arrive. And that's why, shortly after taking office, I approved a longstanding request for more troops. After consultations with our allies, I then announced a strategy recognizing the fundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan and the extremist safe havens in Pakistan. I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian efforts.\nSince then, we've made progress on some important objectives. High-ranking al Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed, and we've stepped up the pressure on al Qaeda worldwide. In Pakistan, that nation's army has gone on its largest offensive in years. In Afghanistan, we and our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election, and -- although it was marred by fraud -- that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan's laws and constitution.\nYet huge challenges remain. Afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has moved backwards. There's no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum. Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe havens along the border. And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. Our new commander in Afghanistan -- General McChrystal -- has reported that the security situation is more serious than he anticipated. In short: The status quo is not sustainable.\nAs cadets, you volunteered for service during this time of danger. Some of you fought in Afghanistan. Some of you will deploy there. As your Commander-in-Chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service. And that's why, after the Afghan voting was completed, I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy. Now, let me be clear: There has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010, so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period. Instead, the review has allowed me to ask the hard questions, and to explore all the different options, along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan, and our key partners. And given the stakes involved, I owed the American people -- and our troops -- no less.\nThis review is now complete. And as Commander-in-Chief, I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home. These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative, while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of Afghanistan.\nI do not make this decision lightly. I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force, and always consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We have been at war now for eight years, at enormous cost in lives and resources. Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters, and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort. And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.\nMost of all, I know that this decision asks even more of you -- a military that, along with your families, has already borne the heaviest of all burdens. As President, I have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars. I have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed. I visited our courageous wounded warriors at Walter Reed. I've traveled to Dover to meet the flag-draped caskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place. I see firsthand the terrible wages of war. If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan, I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow.\nSo, no, I do not make this decision lightly. I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al Qaeda. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak. This is no idle danger; no hypothetical threat. In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror. And this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al Qaeda can operate with impunity. We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and to do that, we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region.\nOf course, this burden is not ours alone to bear. This is not just America's war. Since 9/11, al Qaeda's safe havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali. The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered. And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed Pakistan, because we know that al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they would use them.\nThese facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies. Our overarching goal remains the same: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to prevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future.\nTo meet that goal, we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan. We must deny al Qaeda a safe haven. We must reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government. And we must strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan's security forces and government so that they can take lead responsibility for Afghanistan's future.\nWe will meet these objectives in three ways. First, we will pursue a military strategy that will break the Taliban's momentum and increase Afghanistan's capacity over the next 18 months.\nThe 30,000 additional troops that I'm announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 -- the fastest possible pace -- so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers. They'll increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight. And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans.\nBecause this is an international effort, I've asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies. Some have already provided additional troops, and we're confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead. Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan. And now, we must come together to end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility -- what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world.\nBut taken together, these additional American and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. We'll continue to advise and assist Afghanistan's security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul. But it will be clear to the Afghan government -- and, more importantly, to the Afghan people -- that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.\nSecond, we will work with our partners, the United Nations, and the Afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy, so that the government can take advantage of improved security.\nThis effort must be based on performance. The days of providing a blank check are over. President Karzai's inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction. And going forward, we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance. We'll support Afghan ministries, governors, and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people. We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable. And we will also focus our assistance in areas -- such as agriculture -- that can make an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people.\nThe people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades. They've been confronted with occupation -- by the Soviet Union, and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan land for their own purposes. So tonight, I want the Afghan people to understand -- America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering. We have no interest in occupying your country. We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens. And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron.\nThird, we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan.\nWe're in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That's why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border.\nIn the past, there have been those in Pakistan who've argued that the struggle against extremism is not their fight, and that Pakistan is better off doing little or seeking accommodation with those who use violence. But in recent years, as innocents have been killed from Karachi to Islamabad, it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who are the most endangered by extremism. Public opinion has turned. The Pakistani army has waged an offensive in Swat and South Waziristan. And there is no doubt that the United States and Pakistan share a common enemy.\nIn the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. Those days are over. Moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interest, mutual respect, and mutual trust. We will strengthen Pakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known and whose intentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan's democracy and development. We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting. And going forward, the Pakistan people must know America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.\nThese are the three core elements of our strategy: a military effort to create the conditions for a transition; a civilian surge that reinforces positive action; and an effective partnership with Pakistan.\nI recognize there are a range of concerns about our approach. So let me briefly address a few of the more prominent arguments that I've heard, and which I take very seriously.\nFirst, there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam. They argue that it cannot be stabilized, and we're better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing. I believe this argument depends on a false reading of history. Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action. Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border. To abandon this area now -- and to rely only on efforts against al Qaeda from a distance -- would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and create an unacceptable risk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies.\nSecond, there are those who acknowledge that we can't leave Afghanistan in its current state, but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we already have. But this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through, and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there. It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan, because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan security forces and give them the space to take over.\nFinally, there are those who oppose identifying a time frame for our transition to Afghan responsibility. Indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our war effort -- one that would commit us to a nation-building project of up to a decade. I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests. Furthermore, the absence of a time frame for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.\nAs President, I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, or our interests. And I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces. I don't have the luxury of committing to just one. Indeed, I'm mindful of the words of President Eisenhower, who -- in discussing our national security -- said, \"Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.\"\nOver the past several years, we have lost that balance. We've failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy. In the wake of an economic crisis, too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay the bills. Too many Americans are worried about the future facing our children. Meanwhile, competition within the global economy has grown more fierce. So we can't simply afford to ignore the price of these wars.\nAll told, by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached a trillion dollars. Going forward, I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly. Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly $30 billion for the military this year, and I'll work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring down our deficit.\nBut as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility, we must rebuild our strength here at home. Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. It pays for our military. It underwrites our diplomacy. It taps the potential of our people, and allows investment in new industry. And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last. That's why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open-ended -- because the nation that I'm most interested in building is our own.\nNow, let me be clear: None of this will be easy. The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan. It will be an enduring test of our free society, and our leadership in the world. And unlike the great power conflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century, our effort will involve disorderly regions, failed states, diffuse enemies.\nSo as a result, America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars and prevent conflict -- not just how we wage wars. We'll have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power. Where al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold -- whether in Somalia or Yemen or elsewhere -- they must be confronted by growing pressure and strong partnerships.\nAnd we can't count on military might alone. We have to invest in our homeland security, because we can't capture or kill every violent extremist abroad. We have to improve and better coordinate our intelligence, so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks.\nWe will have to take away the tools of mass destruction. And that's why I've made it a central pillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists, to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and to pursue the goal of a world without them -- because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever more destructive weapons; true security will come for those who reject them.\nWe'll have to use diplomacy, because no one nation can meet the challenges of an interconnected world acting alone. I've spent this year renewing our alliances and forging new partnerships. And we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim world -- one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict, and that promises a future in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace and prosperity and human dignity.\nAnd finally, we must draw on the strength of our values -- for the challenges that we face may have changed, but the things that we believe in must not. That's why we must promote our values by living them at home -- which is why I have prohibited torture and will close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And we must make it clear to every man, woman and child around the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out on behalf of their human rights, and tend to the light of freedom and justice and opportunity and respect for the dignity of all peoples. That is who we are. That is the source, the moral source, of America's authority.\nSince the days of Franklin Roosevelt, and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents and great-grandparents, our country has borne a special burden in global affairs. We have spilled American blood in many countries on multiple continents. We have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies. We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions -- from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank -- that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings.\nWe have not always been thanked for these efforts, and we have at times made mistakes. But more than any other nation, the United States of America has underwritten global security for over six decades -- a time that, for all its problems, has seen walls come down, and markets open, and billions lifted from poverty, unparalleled scientific progress and advancing frontiers of human liberty.\nFor unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination. Our union was founded in resistance to oppression. We do not seek to occupy other nations. We will not claim another nation's resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours. What we have fought for -- what we continue to fight for -- is a better future for our children and grandchildren. And we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity. (Applause.)\nAs a country, we're not as young -- and perhaps not as innocent -- as we were when Roosevelt was President. Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom. And now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age.\nIn the end, our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms. It derives from our people -- from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy; from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries; from the teachers that will educate our children, and the service of those who work in our communities at home; from the diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad; and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people, by the people, and for the people a reality on this Earth. (Applause.)\nThis vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue -- nor should we. But I also know that we, as a country, cannot sustain our leadership, nor navigate the momentous challenges of our time, if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse.\nIt's easy to forget that when this war began, we were united -- bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack, and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear. I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again. (Applause.) I believe with every fiber of my being that we -- as Americans -- can still come together behind a common purpose. For our values are not simply words written into parchment -- they are a creed that calls us together, and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as one nation, as one people.\nAmerica -- we are passing through a time of great trial. And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering. We will go forward with the confidence that right makes might, and with the commitment to forge an America that is safer, a world that is more secure, and a future that represents not the deepest of fears but the highest of hopes. (Applause.)\nThank you. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you.

{"date": "Fri, 13 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "The Irish Republican Army dissidents who shocked Northern Ireland this week by killing two British soldiers and a policeman within a 48-hour period have made no secret of their ambition to ignite a new wave of sectarian bloodletting.\nBut as formerly sworn enemies filed into a provincial church on Friday to mourn as one, the funeral of the slain policeman provided the latest and most powerful demonstration of the ways in which the province\u2019s people and its leaders have united against a return to the violence that racked Northern Ireland for 30 years.\nRallies that drew thousands to silent vigils this week in Belfast and other major towns across the north, and dozens of interviews across the province, suggested that the old antagonists \u2014 Roman Catholics and Protestants, nationalists seeking a united Ireland and Unionists committed to keeping Ulster a part of Britain \u2014 remain determined to settle their future in peace.\nThe relative prosperity that peace has brought, the respite from the anguished cycle of killings and revenge, has built a constituency for the power-sharing government in Belfast. That arrangement, which has worked awkwardly but steadily for 22 months, has given practical form to the reconciliation envisaged in the Good Friday agreement of 1998, which was brokered by the United States.\nAs much as it was a farewell to the police officer slain on Monday night, Constable Stephen Carroll, the funeral on Friday served, just as much, as a memorial for the two British soldiers killed as they picked up pizzas outside their base in the town of Antrim on Saturday night.\nThe melancholy of the occasion was captured in the laments played by the lone bagpiper who marched ahead of Mr. Carroll\u2019s black hearse, as it passed through streets lined with thousands of Catholic and Protestant townspeople in the town of Banbridge, 30 miles southwest of Belfast. But more powerful still was the mood of resolve and defiance evident among the 1,000 mourners in St. Therese Catholic Church.\nSome who were there said that never in Ireland\u2019s modern history had there been quite such an improbable gathering of old foes.\nVeterans of the Irish Republican Army, spearhead for nearly a century of the drive for the reunification of Ireland, were arrayed in the pews alongside loyalists still pledged to keep Ulster part of Britain.\nPoliticians and police commanders from both sides of the border sat together, and Anglican and Roman Catholic priests stood beside each other before the altar. Old adversaries wept together, especially when a choir sang an ethereal version of \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d a hymn sung often during the funerals of the 3,700 people killed during \u201cthe Troubles,\u201d as people in Ireland called the decades of sectarian struggle.\nConstable Carroll was in many ways a totem for what has changed.\nA 48-year-old Catholic, he spent 23 years in a police force that has historically been Protestant-dominated, but that has changed as radically as anything else in Ulster as the province moves deeper into the peace process. An avid athlete, he planned to retire in 18 months and become a trainer. He told his wife, Kate, as he left for work on Monday, knowing that dissident republican gunmen still lurked in some of the poorer housing estates of Craigavon, the new town 15 miles from Banbridge where he died, that it would be \u201cironic\u201d if he should be killed so close to the end of his police service, and when the province was officially at peace.\nThe Catholic priest who delivered the main eulogy at the funeral, Canon Liam Stevenson, 50, encapsulated the mood with his condemnation of the men from the two dissident I.R.A. groups \u2014 the Continuity I.R.A. and the Real I.R.A. \u2014 who claimed responsibility for the killings. He said the killers had \u201cabused\u201d the patriotism they proclaimed because \u201cit is robbed of its intrinsic value when it is allied to violence and death.\u201d Another speaker, Bishop John McAreavey, said that \u201cthe people of Ireland have chosen a better way forward, the way of reconciliation and peace, and we are determined not to allow ourselves to be dragged back into the morass of violence.\u201d\nBut Stevenson\u2019s most striking passage came when he said an attack on the new police force was tantamount to \u201can attack on the whole population of Northern Ireland.\u201d Now known as the Police Service of Northern Ireland, it emerged from the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which was widely hated among Catholics for its harsh tactics. Now, it has been stripped of paramilitary units and has recruited equally among Catholics and Protestants. When he died, Constable Carroll was in an ordinary patrol car, not an armored Land Rover of the kind used by the old police force, part of an effort to show a gentler profile to Catholics.\nAn equal resolve prevailed among the mourners who streamed throughout the week to lay flowers outside the Massareene army base at Antrim, 15 miles northwest of Belfast. The bodies of the two soldiers who died there, Sappers Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey, both in their early 20s, were flown back to their families in mainland Britain on Thursday.\nMost Protestant mourners who lingered amid the yellow paint markings where the killers left spent shell casings said they wanted nothing to disturb the peace process. Only one man among more than a dozen people interviewed demurred. Jonathan Johns, a 40-year-old, army-trained medic, who drove 40 miles from his home in Banbridge with his three small children, said he worried about the sincerity of the leaders of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., in the power-sharing government. \u201cThe eyes of the world are on them, so they\u2019re saying the right things,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s just say I\u2019m skeptical. Who\u2019s to say this wasn\u2019t part of a wider agenda?\u201d\nA lunchtime vigil in Belfast on Wednesday drew at least 5,000 people into the plaza before the city hall to listen to a bagpiper playing \u201cAbide With Me,\u201d a mournful Protestant hymn, and to applaud when a rally organizer said the people of the province had shown that \u201cthey absolutely and totally reject the murderers.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s appalling,\u201d Gavin Bell, a 31-year-old civil servant and Catholic, said of the killings. \u201cI\u2019d always thought the dissidents were disorganized and ineffective. Now the worry is whether this is the start of a new campaign.\u201d\nOne of the week\u2019s most arresting moments came when Martin McGuinness, a former I.R.A. commander who now serves as the province\u2019s deputy first minister, visited Kate Carroll, the policeman\u2019s widow, and called the constable\u2019s killer\u2019s \u201ctraitors\u201d who should be turned in to the police, a demand that many in Northern Ireland said no senior member of the republican movement had ever made before.\nBut Mrs. Carroll\u2019s public remarks may have been the most poignant of all. Before leaving her home for the funeral on Friday, she said that people resorting to violence to settle Ireland\u2019s future should realize that, like her husband, the only \u201cpiece of land\u201d they would end up with would be the six feet of a grave plot, and that a broader grasp of that would mean that her husband had not \u201cdied for nothing.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they realize that?\u201d she said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/world/europe/14ireland.html", "title": "Intended to Incite, Irish Killings Draw Former Enemies Together", "author": "JOHN F.

{"date": "Thu, 10 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov on Thursday all but ruled out imposing new sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program, brushing aside growing Western concerns that Iran had made significant progress in recent months in a bid for nuclear weapons.\nMr. Lavrov said he believed that a new set of proposals that Iran gave to European nations on Wednesday offered a viable basis for negotiations to end the dispute. He said he did not believe that the United Nations Security Council would approve new sanctions against Iran, which could ban Iran from exporting oil or importing gasoline.\n\u201cBased on a brief review of the Iranian papers, my impression is there is something there to use,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said at a gathering of experts on Russia. \u201cThe most important thing is Iran is ready for a comprehensive discussion of the situation, what positive role it can play in Iraq, Afghanistan and the region.\u201d\nMr. Lavrov\u2019s comments underscored the challenge facing the Obama administration as it plans its next move in the United States\u2019 longstanding struggle to prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons.\nRussia is a permanent member of the Security Council, allowing it to veto any sanctions resolution, and it has close economic and diplomatic ties to Iran.\nIran says its program to enrich uranium is aimed at producing electricity, and it has refused to halt the process, which can have civilian and military purposes.\nOn Thursday, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran\u2019s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, said Iran would not negotiate further with the major powers about its nuclear program, Iranian news services reported.\nA five-page letter that Iran delivered to the European powers, and sent to Washington via the Swiss on Wednesday, is titled a \u201cPackage of Proposals by the Islamic Republic of Iran for Comprehensive and Constructive Negotiations.\u201d But it is devoid of specifics, and never mentions Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nInstead, the letter, which was published Thursday on the Web site of ProPublica.org, an investigative journalism group, refers in the vaguest terms to \u201ccreating a world filled with spirituality, friendship, prosperity, wellness and security.\u201d\nIt hews closely to a proposal issued by Iran last year. Among the topics it proposes to discuss is global disarmament, which has been interpreted in Washington as suggesting that Iran wants to link any discussion of the fate of its nuclear program with talks about the arsenals of the United States and Israel, among others.\nOn Wednesday the American ambassador to the atomic energy agency, Glyn Davies, declared that Iran had reached \u201cpossible breakout capacity\u201d \u2014 the ability to acquire enough fuel and expertise to complete building a nuclear weapon relatively quickly \u2014 if it decided to enrich its uranium to bomb-grade.\nPresident Obama has sought to take a less adversarial stance toward Iran\u2019s nuclear program than President George W. Bush did. But with seemingly little to show for it, Mr. Obama may now try to move more aggressively.\nObtaining the Kremlin\u2019s backing is one of his biggest hurdles in doing so, and when Mr. Obama was in Moscow in July, he spoke at length with President Dmitri A. Medvedev about the Iranian nuclear program.\nWhile the tone of the talks may have appeared promising, the Russian side now seems to be positioning itself as something of an arbiter in the dispute between Iran and the West.\n\u201cSome of the sanctions under discussion, including oil and oil products, are not a mechanism to force Iran to cooperate,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said Thursday at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, an annual meeting of Russia experts. \u201cThey are a step to a full-blown blockade, and I do not think they would be supported at the U.N. Security Council.\u201d\nMr. Lavrov added, \u201cIran is a partner that has never harmed Russia in any way.\u201d\nCliff Kupchan, a director at the Eurasia Group, a global risk-consulting firm based in New York, was at the meeting and questioned Mr. Lavrov about Iran.\n\u201cThey derive a lot of influence and prestige by being the point man on Iran,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said of the Russian officials in an interview. \u201cI think that they are making clear that they are in the middle of the game. They are stating that the road to Tehran goes through Moscow.\u201d\nIsrael has become increasingly anxious about Iran\u2019s possible effort to secure both nuclear and conventional weapons, and reports surfaced in Jerusalem this week that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, made a secret visit to Moscow on Monday to lobby the Kremlin to spurn Iran\u2019s requests.\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s aides have not officially confirmed the trip, and when asked about it on Thursday, Mr. Lavrov referred questions to the Israeli side.\nMr. Lavrov offered a more categorical denial to unconfirmed reports that a cargo ship that was hijacked off the coast of Europe had been smuggling a sophisticated Russian air-defense system to Iran detected by Israel.\nIsrael has repeatedly sought assurances from Russia that it will not deliver the system, the S-300, to Iran.\nThe cargo ship disappeared under mysterious circumstances in late July, and the reluctance of the Russian authorities to explain exactly what happened has spawned a raft of rumors. The ship was located in mid-August with its crew safe, and the alleged hijackers were arrested.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/world/europe/11nuke.html", "title": "Russia Says Sanctions Against Iran Are Unlikely", "author": "CLIFFORD J.

{"date": "Mon, 09 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TARAKHEL, Afghanistan \u2014 The locals call the place \u201cThe Taliban Cemetery,\u201d a weed-clotted memorial to the men who died for the movement during its fiercest campaigns in the years before 9/11.\nThe graveyard, next to this tiny village north of Kabul, sits a few miles from what was once the front line against the rebels who fought the Taliban after the group captured Kabul in 1996. Those rebels, then known as the Northern Alliance, finally overran the Taliban and captured Kabul \u2014 with American help \u2014 in November 2001.\nEight years after the last fighter was buried here, the cemetery has fallen into decrepitude. Many of the gravestones are broken and smashed \u2014 the vandalism, the villagers say, of a marauding anti-Taliban militia. Weeds and rocks and tattered prayer flags obscure much of what is left. The villagers of Tarakhel, though Taliban enthusiasts, have given up trying to care for the place.\nBut with a little digging and scraping, the Taliban cemetery reveals itself, and the time that it preserved. Together, the surviving graves offer a history of the Taliban\u2019s early years, and of the tumultuous era when young jihadists from around the world traveled to Afghanistan to train and fight.\nThere are perhaps two hundred men buried here, not just Afghans but Arabs, Chechens, Indians and Pakistanis. There is even the body of a young man from Great Britain.\n\u201cThe Arabs are buried over there,\u201d said Mohammed Zahir, sweeping his finger toward a swath of broken earth at the rear of the cemetery. Mr. Zahir, who lives in Tarakhel, wandered over when he spotted a foreigner walking among the tombs.\nThe Arab fighters, Mr. Zahir said, were killed in the first American bombardment in October 2001. A United Nations truck brought their bodies here and dumped them. The villagers of Tarakhel gave the dead hurried burials, in unmarked graves; they feared the gunmen of the Northern Alliance would dig up and desecrate the corpses if they discovered them. As it was, they came and smashed many of the tombstones.\n\u201cThey were animals that day,\u201d Mr. Zahir said.\nYet many of the gravestones are intact, preserving the stories of the men underground: their names, the places they were born, the days when they died. Each of the dead here, over the years, got his own granite tombstone, a gift from the Taliban warlords who ran the country then.\nToward the front of the cemetery lies the grave of an Afghan Talib \u2014 the word means \u201cstudent\u201d in Pashto \u2014 who died from wounds suffered in a battle against the Northern Alliance in Kunduz in 1997. His information is chiseled into a slab of gray granite:\nTalib\nGul Ahmed\nSon of Shams Mohammed\nResident of Yaftal District, Badakhshan Province\nDate wounded: 11-9-1997\nDied in Quetta Hospital, Pakistan\n22 years old\nThe Afghan dead appear to be a minority in the Taliban cemetery; it\u2019s possible that even Talibs are, too. Most of those buried in Tarakhel appear to be foreigners, either volunteers with the Taliban or regulars with one of the many armed groups that flocked here in the 1990s.\nA couple of tombs away from Mr. Ahmed\u2019s is that of a man named Sher Khan Kashmiri. The white gravestone says he was born in \u201cOccupied Kashmir,\u201d the name given by some Muslims to the Muslim-majority state in India. Islamic militants there have been battling to break away from India since the British Empire dissolved in South Asia in 1947.\nMr. Kashmiri, the gravestone says, was a member of Harkat-ul-Ansar, a Pakistan-based militant group fighting in Kashmir. In the 1990s, the group also fought alongside the Taliban and Al Qaeda. It was a Harkat-ul-Ansar training camp in eastern Afghanistan where the United States, in August 1998, fired a volley of cruise missiles to kill Osama bin Laden. He was not there.\nMr. Kashmiri, the gravestone says, was \u201cmartyred\u201d in Pul-i-Kumri, in northern Afghanistan, on June 7, 1997.\nOther militant groups are represented in the Taliban Cemetery, including Muhammad\u2019s Army, another Pakistani militant group and an offshoot of Harkat-ul-Ansar. Members of Mohammad\u2019s Army were implicated in the death of Daniel Pearl, the American reporter who was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan in 2002. They, too, fought alongside the Taliban.\n\u201cThe Martyr Lives Forever,\u201d a Muhammad\u2019s Army gravestone says, above the name of Hafez Mohammed Wazir of Mansera, Pakistan. He was killed June 26, 2001.\nPerhaps the most startling of all the relics here is the grave that contains the man named Mohammed Usman. His tombstone says he was from Great Britain, and was killed in Kunduz in December 1998.\nThe words on Mr. Usman\u2019s white granite gravestone are written in Urdu, the language of Pakistan, indicating, perhaps, that Mr. Usman was of Pakistani descent. A bit of poetry is carved into the stone:\nA person who goes through life unfamiliar with the meaning of justice will vanish from the minds of men.\nAs the scattered dates indicate, the Taliban cemetery started small and filled up over the years, with many of the dead coming from battles on the northern steppes, where the Taliban conquest finally stalled. The first tomb dates from 1996, when Taliban fighters captured the Afghan capital. The last are from the autumn of 2001, after the start of the American war.\nAlong with those dead Arab fighters brought here in 2001 were many living ones, the villagers of Tarakhel said. Dozens of them survived the American onslaught in October and November of 2001, and fled through Tarakhel to fight another day.\n\u201cWe took the Arabs to the border and helped them escape,\u201d said Ayahuddin, an elderly villager in Tarakhel. \u201cWe were with them then.\u201d\nAnd they are with them now. The Taliban cemetery may have fallen into disrepair, but the villagers say the Taliban are fighting the good fight, just as they were in bygone days.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be back, you know,\u201d Mr. Zahir said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/world/asia/10taliban.html", "title": "For Taliban Fighters, a Fading Memorial", "author": "DEXTER FILKINS"}
{"date": "Thu, 15 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The government of President Hamid Karzai is preparing for the likelihood that he will have to face an election runoff with his main challenger, Afghanistan\u2019s ambassador here said Thursday, acknowledging an outcome that Western diplomats had been pushing for but that could complicate the debate over whether to send more American troops.\nThe comments by the ambassador in Washington, Said Tayeb Jawad, were the first in which Mr. Karzai\u2019s government conceded that a runoff was likely, after weeks of investigation into stark cases of election fraud.\nIn an interview on Wednesday and in a follow-up telephone conversation on Thursday, Mr. Jawad said that although he had no direct contact with the commission auditing the vote, the Karzai government was preparing for the commission to announce Saturday that a runoff was necessary.\n\u201cChances are there will be a second round, although it was not so sure up to a couple of days ago, but now it looks like there will be a second round,\u201d Mr. Jawad said Wednesday.\nThough a runoff could ease some questions about the legitimacy of the Afghan government, the Obama administration now faces the prospect of further delay in making a decision on increasing troop levels in Afghanistan, administration officials said Thursday. They said the potential runoff was dominating much of the continuing debate over Afghanistan policy in the White House.\nAn administration official, who requested anonymity to speak more openly about internal White House deliberations, said that while \u201cit is quite legitimate to delay a decision on troops until you know what kind of government you\u2019re dealing with,\u201d President Obama\u2019s advisers were in fact split over whether Mr. Obama should announce troop deployments without knowing who was in charge in Afghanistan or wait until the political situation in Kabul was clear.\nAnother complicating factor, administration officials said, is the prospect that there could be a power-sharing agreement between Mr. Karzai and his main opponent, Abdullah Abdullah. Both Mr. Abdullah and the Karzai government\u2019s ambassador to Washington hinted at that possibility on Thursday.\nThe debate over the American strategy in Afghanistan has been the consuming foreign policy issue of the Obama presidency. In recent weeks, the president and his top diplomats and military advisers have been engaged in a remarkably public debate over the size of a future military force and how to deal with a Karzai government it has accused of corruption and ineptitude.\nAdministration officials have said they are not close to making a final decision, and some Republican critics have already accused them of moving too slowly.\nAfghan and American officials said the earliest that a runoff vote could be held was late this month or early next month, with results expected about two weeks later. Some Afghans said, however, that the vote might have to be delayed because of bad winter weather until the spring, a nightmare situation for a White House that does not want to remain in limbo.\nThe new round of voting would also mean a repeat of the huge security operation that sought to keep the first round of voting, on Aug. 20, safe from insurgents\u2019 attacks.\nUntil now, Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers have said they expect a decision from him on additional troop deployments, perhaps as many as 40,000, within the next few weeks. Administration officials and Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, have said they have only 12 to 18 months to show progress in Afghanistan, where security has been steadily deteriorating and deaths of American and NATO troops are increasing.\nAdministration officials said that it was their understanding that an election commission would announce, probably in Kabul on Saturday, that after questionable ballots had been thrown out, Mr. Karzai had received only 48 percent of the vote, a tally that would mean a runoff was needed. The original vote has been marred by widespread evidence of fraud and ballot-stuffing for Mr. Karzai.\nIn a news conference in Kabul on Thursday, Mr. Abdullah hinted that he might be willing to negotiate a power-sharing deal with Mr. Karzai, but only after an announcement about whether a runoff election is needed.\n\u201cIt will be a different environment, no doubt, once the announcement is made,\u201d Mr. Abdullah said. \u201cWe reserve our reaction, and what to do post-announcement, for that period.\u201d\nIn the interview in Washington on Wednesday, the Afghan ambassador did not discount the possibility of a deal between Mr. Karzai and Mr. Abdullah, but he said he viewed it with skepticism.\n\u201cThat\u2019s peaceable, that\u2019s doable, that\u2019s probably a good way to go politically, but whether it would make a huge difference as far as the reality on the ground, and as far as bringing more capable, skillful Afghans to the government, I doubt it,\u201d Mr. Jawad said.\nIn the meantime, it is unclear whether any deal would be legally possible. The Afghan Constitution requires a runoff to be held in two weeks if no candidate receives more than half the vote.\nBut Afghanistan violated its Constitution as recently as the spring, when Mr. Karzai failed to hold elections within the time frame it mandated. To preserve his legitimacy, the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Karzai could remain the legal head of state until a new one was selected, even though his term had expired.\n\u201cThere might be some other miracle they could do,\u201d said Wadir Safi, a professor at Kabul University.\nIn further evidence that Mr. Karzai was feeling vulnerable, his longtime ally Zalmay Khalilzad, a former American ambassador to Afghanistan, arrived in the country on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Kabul said that Mr. Khalilzad, an American citizen born in Afghanistan, had come as a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d and that he was not representing the United States government.\nRelations between Mr. Karzai and Mr. Khalilzad, who also served as American ambassador in Iraq, became strained in the spring after Mr. Karzai reportedly led Mr. Khalilzad to believe he would get a government position and later dropped the offer.\nThe two men met Thursday morning, a spokesman for Mr. Karzai\u2019s campaign said, but he gave no further details.\nIn a brief appearance on Afghan television on Wednesday, Mr. Khalilzad indicated that he had come to help Afghans during a difficult election process, but an official in Mr. Abdullah\u2019s campaign said they did not want his assistance. \u201cWe do not need any broker,\u201d the official said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/16/world/asia/16afghan.html", "title": "Karzai Aide Says Afghan Runoff Vote Is Likely", "author": "ELISABETH BUMILLER and SABRINA TAVERNISE"}

{"date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Determined to demonstrate its latest missile technology both to its adversaries and perhaps to potential buyers in the Middle East, North Korea pressed ahead with final preparations on Friday to launch a multistage rocket.\nThe countdown could begin as early as Saturday morning, and North Korea says its rocket will blast off sometime between then and Wednesday. It warned aircraft to stay clear of its easterly trajectory over northern Japan, toward the Pacific.\nWeather forecasts say it will be cloudy with no strong winds over the Musudan-ri launching site on North Korea\u2019s coast, meaning the North could launch the rocket anytime during the period.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s almost certain North Korea will fire the missile,\u201d President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea said Friday in London, where he was attending the Group of 20 summit meeting, Reuters reported. Mr. Lee vowed a \u201cstrong and stern response.\u201d\nNorth Korea says it is launching an experimental communications satellite. But Washington and its allies see the test as a provocative demonstration of ballistic missile technology and an attempt to secure a place on President Obama\u2019s crowded foreign policy agenda.\nNorth Korea began fueling the rocket on Thursday. Neighboring governments were on heightened alert on Friday, and had navy ships with missile-tracking radar deployed in waters near North Korea. For its part, the North reportedly moved fighter jets closer to the launching site and threatened to counterattack if any government tried to stop it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say for sure whether the object the North is launching is a satellite or a missile,\u201d said Lee Jong-joo, a government spokeswoman in Seoul. \u201cBut our principled position is that whether this is a missile or something else, it threatens peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\nUnable to persuade the North to cancel its plan, Washington, Tokyo and Seoul focused on how to forge a unified front with China and Russia in penalizing the North, while also drawing it back to six-nation talks on ending its nuclear weapons program.\nNorth Korea is banned from ballistic missile tests under two United Nations Security Council resolutions, which were adopted in 2006 after it launched a ballistic missile and conducted its first nuclear test.\nBut if North Korea puts a satellite into orbit \u2014 as it claims it wants to do, and as a growing number of analysts believe it will try to do \u2014 then any attempt to introduce new sanctions will be hobbled by disputes over whether the North violated the 2006 resolutions, analysts said.\nIn Strasbourg, France, Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said the launching would be a violation of Security Council resolutions, and said \u201cpreparations\u201d were being made if it went ahead, Reuters reported. He did not provide details in comments to reporters during a trip to Europe by Mr. Obama.\nPrime Minister Taro Aso of Japan told China\u2019s president, Hu Jintao, during the Group of 20 summit meeting that if the launching went ahead, there should be a new United Nations resolution, the Yomiuri newspaper reported. Mr. Hu showed \u201csome understanding\u201d but did not made a clear commitment, the newspaper said.\nFor the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, who reportedly suffered a stroke in August, a successful launching would demonstrate his country\u2019s mastery of crucial missile technologies.\nMr. Kim is also using the tensions he has stirred up to rally his hungry people amid dwindling foreign aid, and to demonstrate to the outside world that he is still in charge, analysts said. In a sales pitch for his missiles, Mr. Kim may also have invited arms dealers from the Middle East to the launching site, they said.\n\u201cEvidence suggests that North Korea has had extensive dealings with Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Yemen and Libya on ballistic missiles and possibly even nuclear warheads,\u201d said a recent report from the Congressional Research Service in Washington.\nExperts believe that the rocket North Korea is about to launch is derived from its Taepodong-2 missile, which the North began developing in the 1990s. But they are not sure about its potential or the North\u2019s ability to arm missiles with nuclear warheads.\nThe Congressional Research Service report said some analysts believed that the Taepodong-2 missile could deliver a 1,500- to 2,200-pound payload more than 4,000 miles, within range of the Alaskan coast, as well as all American military targets in Japan and Guam.\nThe North Korean rocket would weigh about 80 tons and could place a payload of 100 kilograms, or 220 pounds, into orbit at about 250 miles, David Wright, co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists\u2019 Global Security Program, wrote recently , citing some inconclusive assumptions. When used as a missile, the same rocket could carry a 500-kilogram, or 1,100-pound, payload about 5,600 miles, far enough to reach San Francisco.\nBut \u201csince it likely would be difficult for North Korea to build a first-generation warhead and heat shield with a mass of 500 kilograms, this wouldn\u2019t represent a true intercontinental nuclear capability,\u201d Mr. Wright wrote.\nThe North\u2019s first test of the Taepodong-2 missile failed in 2006 when it blew apart 40 seconds after launching.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/world/asia/04korea.html", "title": "North Korea Rocket Launch on Track", "author": "CHOE SANG-HUN"}

The group said the amnesty\u2019s effectiveness remained \u201cshaky and uncertain.\u201d Outside analysts said it was premature to say a new era of calm had come to the Niger Delta, one of Africa\u2019s most strategic and troubled regions.\nPresident Umaru Yar\u2019Adua began the 60-day amnesty offer in August for any fighter willing to come out of the region\u2019s million-square-mile network of oil-laden creeks and swamps, turn in his weapon and accept a $13 daily stipend in exchange.\nAround 8,000 to 10,000 fighters were eligible, and it is unclear how many fighters actually accepted or how many weapons they surrendered. Television images of fighters turning in weapons at collection centers suggested that hundreds of them had responded, but the government has not provided any numbers.\n\u201cWith the surrender of some of the militant groups, the government now has the guns it was looking for, but whether or not this amnesty would work depends on what President Yar\u2019Adua does after the expiration of his 60-day amnesty,\u201d said Annkio Briggs, a spokeswoman for Ijaw Republican Assembly, one of the militant groups.\nIn a statement released shortly after one of its key commanders, Farah Dagogo, publicly accepted the government\u2019s amnesty, MEND said it had since replaced its repentant leaders and would soon be commencing \u201cthe next phase\u201d of its campaign, which the group said \u201ccould mean aggressive lobbying to engage government in dialogue or the language they understand, which is violence.\u201d\nIn Port Harcourt, Nigeria\u2019s oil capital, ordinary people expressed worry that with the expiration of the 60-day amnesty period, the Nigerian government had given itself justification to send troops into the swamps to flush out recalcitrant fighters.\nThey pointed to a military offensive last May that reportedly left hundreds dead in a half-dozen villages, and they said the government might be planning a similar action.\nPaul Agidi, 53, who said he lost his aged mother and sister in that military crackdown, said that with the end of the amnesty, \u201cPresident Yar\u2019Adua now has an excuse to come after us even more viciously.\u201d\nHis skepticism reflected a fairly common sentiment across the Niger Delta, a situation that highlights the local people\u2019s lack of trust in the central government.\nIn southeastern Bayelsa State, former fighters who have accepted the government\u2019s amnesty and rehabilitation program are housed in school dormitories without any clear plans for re-integrating them into the society.\n\u201cThis, to me, shows that the government is either not sincere or they haven\u2019t quite thought this thing through, and this is one of the reasons why I think it\u2019d be premature to begin to hail the so-called amnesty as successful,\u201d Ms. Briggs said.\nPresident Yar\u2019Adua has been in an ecstatic mood since a few prominent militants surrendered last week, saying that his government was committed to addressing the issues behind their armed resistance.\n\u201cWe shall do everything in our power to ensure that the oil on the land and waters of the Niger Delta shall begin to be a source of blessing rather than a curse to the people of the area,\u201d the president said after a meeting with the militant leaders at the presidential villa in Abuja.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/world/africa/05nigeria.html", "title": "Nigerian Amnesty Program Viewed With Caution", "author": "SENAN MURRAY"}

This provoked an uproar among French officials and the publishing community here, and the discussions were suspended.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t let ourselves be stripped of our heritage to the benefit of a big company, no matter how friendly, big or American it is,\u201d Mr. Sarkozy said last week, apparently in a reference to Google.\nThe money pledged Monday will finance a public-private partnership that will digitize the nation\u2019s cultural works, Mr. Sarkozy said. Yet that partnership might well involve Google.\n\u201cThe question remains open,\u201d said Bruno Racine, president of the National Library, in a telephone interview. He emphasized the \u201cnecessity of a partnership with the private sector\u201d in order to secure the capital needed for vast digitization projects.\nHe put the cost of digitizing the National Library\u2019s collections, which include over 14 million books and several million other documents, at more than $1.5 billion.\nThose who opposed the National Library\u2019s discussions with Google were concerned primarily with its \u201cdominant place\u201d in the digital market, he said, noting, \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that it is a private company.\u201d\nThe French culture minister, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand, met last week with David C. Drummond, a senior vice president and chief legal officer at Google, to express his concerns about a potential collaboration with the company.\nFrance has long regarded Google warily. In 2005, French and German leaders announced plans, since abandoned, to develop a multimedia search engine to be called Quaero \u2014 \u201cI seek,\u201d in Latin \u2014 seen by many as a direct challenge to the company. The French government has also urged the European Union to undertake its own book digitization project.\nThe United States District Court for the Southern District of New York is currently assessing the legality of Google\u2019s global digitization plan. In a September submission to the court, the French Ministry of Culture wrote that the plan did not conform either to \u201cintellectual property law or to competition law and constitutes a threat to cultural diversity.\u201d\nA modified version of Google\u2019s settlement with groups representing book publishers and authors, submitted last month to the court, would restrict its book scanning to works published in the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada.\nThe $1.1 billion pledged by Mr. Sarkozy is part of a $51 billion stimulus package, announced Monday, aimed primarily at French universities, researchers, manufacturers and telecommunications companies. France will finance the investments largely through government borrowing, against the urgings of the European Union and the country\u2019s own audit authority.

He was 79.\nHis sister, the fashion designer Rose Torrente-Mett, said the cause was respiratory failure after he suffered from leukemia for several years, Agence France-Presse reported.\nWhat Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut was to film, Mr. Lapidus was at least for a time to French haute couture. Determinedly modern, he translated the design vocabulary of haute couture into sleek, affordable clothes aimed at French consumers barely in their 20s.\n\u201cIn France now, the daughters are clothing the mothers and the sons the fathers,\u201d he said in a 1964 interview when introducing his ready-to-wear line at Macy\u2019s. Mr. Lapidus sensed a generational shift in France and capitalized on it; his clothes found favor with style-setters like Brigitte Bardot, Alain Delon, Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jane Fonda.\nEdmond Lapidus, who later adopted the American-sounding Ted, was born in Paris, where his father, a Russian immigrant, worked as a tailor. Unable to afford medical school, he took up the family trade. While attending a technical school in Tokyo, he saw the possibility of applying high fashion fabricating techniques to industrial production.\n\u201cIf you have the right work force, there\u2019s no reason why this cannot be done in a factory just as well as in a fashion house,\u201d he said.\nAfter an apprenticeship with Dior, he started his own fashion house in 1951. In 1958 he opened the Ted Lapidus boutique on the Rue Marbeuf. In 1963, he created a near scandal in the world of haute couture by forming a partnership with the manufacturer Belle Jardini\u00e8re, which mass-produced his designs and sold them at its 250 budget-priced stores in France. Regardless, that year he was admitted to the official French couture association.\n\u201cHe was one of the first to do boutiques, along with Yves Saint Laurent,\u201d said George Simonton, an assistant professor of fashion design at the Fashion Institute of Technology. \u201cThey became so popular that they spread to the United States.\u201d\nMr. Lapidus\u2019s first boutique in New York opened across from Bloomingdale\u2019s in 1974. It was followed a year later by a store on Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street.\n\u201cHis clothes really fit,\u201d Mr. Simonton said. \u201cEven people without good bodies looked good in them because they were so well tailored. He was a pioneer in making the denim category sexy by putting some style and fit into it.\u201d\nMr. Lapidus may be best remembered for a sand-colored safari jacket with leather lacing in the front, worn by Ms. Bardot, and for a military-style jacket with epaulets and gold buttons, both produced for the mass market.\nIn the 1970s Mr. Lapidus turned his energies to franchising his boutiques and licensing his name for perfumes, jewelry, watches and sunglasses. In 1989 his son, Olivier, became design director of the company, which was sold to a succession of owners.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/world/europe/01lapidus.html", "title": "Ted Lapidus, Designer Who Reshaped French Fashion, Is Dead at 79", "author": "WILLIAM GRIMES"}

Mohammad Akbar Barakzai, the provincial governor, said two of the attackers had also been killed.\n\u201cThe checkpoint was set up on the main highway to provide security for the highway and villages around the area,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\nThe Interior Ministry reported that around the same time, eight officers were killed when militants attacked a police checkpoint in Lashkar Gah, the capital of troubled Helmand Province, in the south, according to The Associated Press.\nIt was not immediately clear if the two attacks had been linked, in an attempt by the militants to discourage Afghans from joining the security forces.\nThe attacks came after the American commander in charge of training the Afghan security forces said last week that there had been a recent wave of recruits for the Afghan Army, most likely because of a pay increase that he said put salaries close to those of Taliban fighters.\nSeparately, the NATO command in Afghanistan said troops working with Afghan forces detained a militant supplying and distributing weapons to insurgents fighting the American-led coalition in Khost Province.\nThe suspect was said to belong to the Haqqani militant group, which has ties with Al Qaeda.\nIn another operation in Kandahar Province, a joint Afghan-international security force \u201cdetained a Taliban weapons facilitator and a couple of other militants,\u201d a NATO statement said.\n\u201cNo shots were fired and no one was harmed in either operation,\u201d the statement said.\nForeign forces in Afghanistan include some 68,000 Americans and 27,000 from other coalition countries. President Obama has pledged to send another 30,000 troops, while allies in the 43-nation coalition have said they will commit 7,000 more, though that number includes some already in the country.\nA central part of Washington\u2019s strategy is to train Afghan forces so that American troops can begin withdrawing in July 2011.\nBut President Hamid Karzai said last week that Afghanistan would not be able to pay for its own security until at least 2024, underscoring his government\u2019s long-term financial dependence on the United States and NATO.\nLast weekend, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain joined a procession of coalition leaders, including senior Obama administration officials, to visit Afghanistan and talk to Mr. Karzai. Coalition leaders say they want Mr. Karzai to root out corruption in his government after a flawed election last August that returned him to power.\nBritain has lost 100 soldiers killed in Afghanistan this year, out of a total of 237 since 2001. The war is unpopular with many voters in advance of elections next year and has left many Britons struggling to understand the conflict\u2019s complexities.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been too simplistic in our attitude towards the Taliban,\u201d said Bishop Stephen Venner, the recently appointed bishop to Britain\u2019s armed forces.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a large number of things that the Taliban say and stand for which none of us in the West could approve, but simply to say therefore that everything they do is bad is not helping the situation,\u201d he said in an interview published Monday in The Daily Telegraph, arguing that it was unhelpful to demonize the insurgents. \u201cThe Taliban can perhaps be admired for their conviction to their faith and their sense of loyalty to each other.\n\u201cWe have to involve all the people of Afghanistan to find justice and prosperity for all,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/world/asia/15afghan.html", "title": "Militants Kill 16 Afghan Police Officers", "author": "SANGAR RAHIMI and ALAN COWELL"}
{"date": "Sun, 21 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LUSAKA, Zambia \u2014 As the gleaming black Mercedes-Benz pulled up to the courthouse, an aide rushed to the passenger door, bowed deeply and then ceremoniously opened it. A foot, finely shod in a dove-gray shoe, appeared, followed by the rest of the man, Frederick Chiluba.\nFor a decade, he was president of Zambia. Now, more than seven years after he left office, a court is deciding whether he stole from his impoverished people. A verdict is to be announced July 20.\nAs common thieves and drug peddlers milled about, Mr. Chiluba strode through the corridors to his hearing, shaking hands, smiling magnanimously, throwing an arm around a co-defendant to chuckle over a private joke.\nAmid men in dingy shirts and worn trousers, he was impeccably dressed in a double-breasted charcoal suit, with a red silk handkerchief peeking from his breast pocket and a gold, diamond-studded watch glinting at his wrist.\nBut once he was in the dock, his jovial demeanor evaporated. In the thin, sickly light that filtered in from narrow windows one recent morning, Mr. Chiluba replied somberly when the magistrate asked why his lawyers had failed to present a written summation on time.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware, your honor, until today that the submissions are not made,\u201d he said.\nMr. Chiluba is a rarity in Africa, a Big Man brought low by corruption charges. He says he has done nothing illegal, but his many critics say his fall was brought on by the usual sins of the powerful \u2014 greed, vanity and pride \u2014 and a major tactical blunder: he underestimated the man he handpicked in 2001 to succeed him as president, the plodding, diligent lawyer Levy Mwanawasa.\nMr. Mwanawasa died last year after an illness. But his pursuit of Mr. Chiluba outlived him.\n\u201cChiluba called himself the political engineer and he believed Mwanawasa would be his puppet,\u201d said Mark Chona, who was appointed by Mr. Mwanawasa to lead a task force to investigate abuses of the Chiluba era. \u201cBut he misread Mwanawasa. For us, it was divine providence.\u201d\nEven as Mr. Chiluba awaited judgment, his wife, Regina, was convicted on corruption charges in March and sentenced to three and a half years in prison.\nMr. Chiluba faced a London civil court judgment in 2007 in a case brought by Zambia\u2019s attorney general. He is still contesting the payment of damages.\nIn that case, Justice Peter Smith of the High Court ruled that the former president owed Zambia $57 million for, among other things, expenditures from a secret intelligence agency bank account in London that was \u201cset up primarily to steal government money.\u201d\n\u201cHe should be ashamed,\u201d Sir Peter wrote.\nThe judge concluded that though Mr. Chiluba had a salary of only about $10,000 a year during his decade in office, he spent more than $500,000 in a single shop, Boutique Basile, in Geneva.\n\u201cThe president (unlike the emperor) needs to be clothed,\u201d Sir Peter archly noted in his judgment.\nThe shop owner, Antonio Basile, testified last year that payment for the clothes sometimes arrived in suitcases stuffed with cash.\nThe goods are now stored in battered metal trunks by Zambia\u2019s anticorruption task force. There are piles of designer suits, monogrammed dress shirts and elegant ties, silk pajamas and dressing gowns.\nBut most remarkable are the more than 100 pairs of size 6 shoes, many affixed with Mr. Chiluba\u2019s initials in brass. He is just a little over five feet tall, and each pair has heels close to two inches high. They are a riot of color and texture: jade-green lizard skin and burgundy suede, cream-color ostrich and lustrous red silk.\nAs his second term drew to a close, Mr. Chiluba claimed that a popular clamor had arisen for him to stay in office. A third term would have required amending the Constitution. But by then, Mr. Chiluba, a former trade union leader elected as a reformer, led a government renowned for corruption. Civic groups and churches organized to stop him, and succeeded.\nNot long after he withdrew from political life, The Post, an independent newspaper, quoted a member of Parliament as saying that Mr. Chiluba was a thief. The state pressed charges of criminal libel against The Post\u2019s editor and the politician.\nThe legal maneuver backfired. Mutembo Nchito, the brash young lawyer representing The Post pro bono, effectively put Mr. Chiluba\u2019s integrity on trial. He won access to records of the intelligence agency bank account in London, and discovered evidence of generous payments to Mr. Chiluba\u2019s children, the boutique and even the chief justice of the Zambian Supreme Court, among others.\n\u201cYou never expect to find a smoking gun,\u201d he said in wonderment.\nBut before Mr. Nchito could introduce the bank records into evidence, he needed President Mwanawasa\u2019s permission.\nMr. Mwanawasa, who could have cited national security to hush up the scandal, instead gave Mr. Nchito permission to use the records, led an effort to strip Mr. Chiluba of immunity and named Mr. Chona to head the task force on corruption. Mr. Nchito was hired to prosecute criminal charges against Mr. Chiluba, who was accused of stealing about $500,000.\nThe task force, now headed by Maxwell Nkole, has won convictions against Ms. Chiluba and former military commanders, among others.\nMr. Mwanawasa not only pushed the prosecution of a leader from his own party but also, in the final months of his life, sharply criticized President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe for his violent repression of the opposition there. Despite his staid manner, Mr. Mwanawasa proved himself a maverick, challenging the patronage politics and tolerance for authoritarian rule that have marred many postcolonial African nations, historians and analysts say.\nMr. Chiluba, in unsworn testimony earlier this year, expressed outrage at what he saw as Mr. Mwanawasa\u2019s rank betrayal.\n\u201cThe presidency in Africa is not cheap,\u201d Mr. Chiluba said, according to a transcript. \u201cPeople die to secure the presidency. But here was Mr. Mwanawasa, who received it on a silver platter from my hands. He stabbed me in the back badly. I still bleed.\u201d\nIn his testimony, Mr. Chiluba denied that he had ever stolen public money. Instead, he said that he had spent money donated in political campaigns by corporate interests and other \u201cwell-wishers.\u201d The identity of these contributors was secret because of what Mr. Chiluba called \u201cthe golden rule of anonymity.\u201d The donors, he said, were made aware that \u201cthe party\u2019s president has personal needs.\u201d\nAfter the recent hearing, Mr. Chiluba walked quickly to his Mercedes, waving off questions with a flick of his hand.\nBack in the courtroom, Moffat Kabamba, a skinny 21-year-old in windbreaker and sneakers, was the next defendant in the dock. He was charged with stealing a cellphone and a bicycle.

{"date": "Thu, 03 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The United States government has spent only 2 percent of the more than $1 billion it has pledged to help Mexico win its battle against drug traffickers, according to a government study released Thursday.\nDespite vows by the Bush administration, and now the Obama administration, to help President Felipe Calder\u00f3n of Mexico in his three-year-long assault against drug cartels, actual spending totaled only about $24 million by the end of September, the Government Accountability Office said.\nCarlos Pascual, who became the American ambassador to Mexico in august, said the 2 percent figure is misleading and does not capture hundreds of millions of dollars that is in the process of being spent. \u201cThe logjams have been broken,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Friday, indicating that five bell helicopters would be delivered to Mexico next week.\nTwo years ago, the United States announced a $1.4 billion, multiyear aid package for Mexico and Central America, a huge increase over previous spending, but the delivery of the money has been bogged down by burdensome contracting rules and other delays, the agency found.\nThe slow disbursement of funds has frustrated top Mexican officials, with Mr. Calder\u00f3n raising the issue in a meeting with American lawmakers this year.\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, questioned about the slow spending when she visited Mexico City in July, acknowledged that \u201cour long process of approval was cumbersome and challenging for the Mexican government\u201d and vowed to \u201csee what we can do to cut that time.\u201d\nMexico and the United States first agreed to increase American antidrug aid during meetings in March 2007 between President George W. Bush and Mr. Calder\u00f3n in the city of M\u00e9rida. The so-called M\u00e9rida Initiative resulting from the meeting represented the largest foreign aid package in the Western Hemisphere since Plan Colombia, a multibillion-dollar effort initiated in 2000 to combat drug cartels and end the insurgency in that country.\nThe hundreds of millions of dollars in annual aid pledged for Mexico represents a significant increase over previous spending. In 2007, for instance, Mexico received only $36.7 million in counternarcotics assistance. Central American nations have also been promised more money in antidrug aid, and spending in the region has been similarly behind expectations.\nThe State Department attributed some of the delay to the challenge of tracking all the money and programs spread across numerous government agencies, saying that dozens of additional staff members have had to be hired at the American Embassy in Mexico to handle administrative matters.\nHelicopters and a surveillance plane are the most expensive items, and contracting requirements associated with such aircraft have slowed the spending, officials said. It usually takes two years from the beginning of contract negotiations for helicopters to be delivered, State Department officials said. In Mexico\u2019s case, the time lapse will be much shorter if five Bell helicopters are delivered as scheduled. But delivery of a surveillance plane and Black Hawk helicopters for the Mexican military will take longer.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/americas/04mexico.html", "title": "Mexico Still Waiting for U.S. Aid, Report Says", "author": "MARC LACEY"}
{"date": "Fri, 19 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The new American commander in Afghanistan has ordered a 60-day review of the entire military mission to identify better ways to separate the population from insurgents, an assessment that is expected to lead to new economic and military steps to carve fighters off from the Taliban.\nOver the next week, the commander, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, is scheduled to crisscross Afghanistan to meet provincial leaders, villagers and American and allied officials, while counterinsurgency experts from inside and outside the government assist in the top-to-bottom review.\nAlthough the review is in its preliminary stages, General McChrystal is already pledging to expand the fight beyond the purely military campaign to defeat the insurgents.\n\u201cThe measure of effectiveness will not be enemy killed,\u201d General McChrystal told a Senate committee at his confirmation hearing on June 2. \u201cIt will be the number of Afghans shielded from violence.\u201d\nThe comment was viewed as particularly significant coming from General McChrystal, who was trained in \u201chearts and minds\u201d counterinsurgency theory as a young Green Beret but more recently spent five years commanding the most secret capture-or-kill teams in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nGeneral McChrystal took command this week, as the American military starts to double its number of personnel members in Afghanistan, to about 68,000 by late summer.\nMore than a dozen senior military officers and Pentagon civilians involved in the review described the effort to refocus military planning, tactics and operations, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because the assessment was just getting under way.\nMilitary planners predict that the increased troop presence will allow the military to raise the stakes on insurgent \u201cday fighters\u201d who pick up arms less for ideology than for money to survive. Until now, they could join the insurgency ad hoc and at relatively little risk of being captured, wounded or killed.\n\u201cWe are going to bring the hurt to the insurgency and offer them an existential choice,\u201d said another senior military officer.\n\u201cThose who are ideologically committed \u2014 we don\u2019t expect them to change. They will fight, and they will die,\u201d the officer said. \u201cBut for the many for whom ideology is not the motivation, we are going to offer them a serious motivation to stop, to make another choice.\u201d\nThe key, of course, is creating other employment. Senior advisers to General McChrystal acknowledge that the increase in troop levels must be complemented by more civilian support for the Afghan government as it struggles to deliver economic opportunities, education, health care and a rule of law.\nOne key will be increasing the size and professionalism of Afghanistan\u2019s security forces. Another will be assuring that farmers who agree to cultivate legitimate crops will be protected from intimidation by narcotics bosses, whose proceeds form a main base of financial support to the insurgency.\nThe military says it will also seek to form a social contract with farmers and small business leaders: If they choose legitimate crops and pay taxes, they will be guaranteed secure transportation routes to markets without the pressure of bribes at illegal checkpoints.\nThe impact of the economy on the insurgency is significant, officials said. Even a primitive economy that is self-sustaining will reduce the number of unemployed men who join the insurgency for day wages.\nA major task will be gaining people\u2019s trust in government. Many Afghans, with their history of powerful regional warlords, remain unconvinced of the legitimacy \u2014 or staying power \u2014 of the central government and its American sponsors.\n\u201cUnless and until the government can be seen to rise above corruption, it will never find acceptance among the people,\u201d said one senior military officer.\nCommanders want to measure whether increased security \u2014 and, with it, increased economic vitality \u2014 can generate more support for the government. In preparation for the troop increase, the military conducted a series of public opinion polls to gauge how Afghans view their government and the quality of their lives.\nEven with the increase in American forces, senior advisers to General McChrystal warned that the military still did not have sufficient troops to do all it wanted. This will prompt commanders to focus on population centers and, in the first months of the troop increase, even surrender the fight in isolated and unpopulated valleys that provide a haven for insurgents.\n\u201cA key to the strategy is to determine where should our limited forces be applied and to what end,\u201d said a senior military officer in Afghanistan. \u201cThe population centers are key to this, and the vast terrain of Afghanistan that may allow for refuge of insurgents may be less of a priority, at least for the near term.\u201d\nBut the larger troop presence should allow General McChrystal, in cooperation with Afghan forces, to put in place a fuller counterinsurgency strategy to clear out insurgents, hold territory and build economic and government institutions.\nIn an important addition to this strategy of clear, hold and build, the McChrystal team is officially adding a fourth goal: to sustain progress, officers said.\nWith widespread outrage over civilian deaths from allied bombing, General McChrystal will also review the rules for ordering in warplanes to drop heavy bombs, officers said.\nAnalysts in Washington and Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, are also trying to map the insurgency to help the military understand the varied, regional nature of the fighters, and to craft different tactics to counter the differing motivations behind those who fight against allied and Afghan forces.\nFor example, insurgents in southern Afghanistan mostly live in southern Afghanistan, while those in the east often fight from havens across the border in Pakistan.\nThose with a haven in Pakistan attack but surrender ground when confronted with an overwhelming force \u2014 to disappear and melt away, and then come back once that force leaves, according to Defense Department officials.\n\u201cSome of the fiercest fighting we run into is where it\u2019s local,\u201d said one Defense Department official, because those fighters are rooted in the community by tribe or local interests in narcotics, lumber harvesting or smuggling.\nBomb Kills 2 Americans\nKANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 A roadside bomb in Kandahar Province killed two American service members on Friday, the military said. The military released no further information.\nIn Oruzgan Province, also in southern Afghanistan, international and Afghan forces killed 16 Taliban militants in a gun battle on Thursday, the police said. One police officer also died in the fighting, it said. NATO forces confirmed that there was a clash in Oruzgan Province but said that they had reports of only five dead, all of them militants.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/world/asia/20military.html", "title": "A New Afghanistan Commander Rethinks How to Measure Success", "author": "THOM SHANKER"}

In 2005, a judge ruled that Mr. Shaik had a corrupt relationship with Mr. Zuma, which included bribes meant to smooth the way to lucrative government contracts.\nAt that time, only Mr. Shaik was on trial. But a parallel case has since dogged Mr. Zuma, who now faces 16 counts of fraud, racketeering and money laundering stretching over a number of years.\nWith parliamentary elections scheduled for April 22, the release of Mr. Shaik comes as many South Africans have begun to anticipate a Zuma presidency and to speculate about how criminal charges against the A.N.C. leader will then be resolved.\nFor his part, Mr. Zuma has said he will not interfere with the rule of law and looks forward to being able to exonerate himself in court.\nOn Tuesday morning, Mr. Shaik arrived at his home in Durban, carried from an ambulance on a stretcher. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping because he is gravely ill,\u201d said his brother, Yunis Shaik, according to the South African Press Association.\nLater, another brother, Moe Shaik, told the eNews television station that Schabir would now \u201cspend his time at home with his family and recover the life that he has lost \u2014 the years of life \u2014 and mainly concentrate on getting his health back.\u201d\nSchabir Shaik had spent much of his incarceration either in private or prison hospitals, suffering from what doctors called high blood pressure, chest pains and depression.\nOn Sunday, the newspaper The Weekender quoted Mr. Zuma as saying his friend was so ill that he should \u201clong ago\u201d have been released on medical grounds.\n\u201cIf the law agrees, why not?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should I discriminate against him because he happens to be my comrade and friend? How can I punish him for that?\u201d\nThe rules for medical parole require that a prisoner be in the final stages of a terminal illness. In rapid succession, assertions of favoritism were made by most of the A.N.C.\u2019s political rivals. A statement from the Inkatha Freedom Party said Mr. Shaik\u2019s release only proved \u201cthat if you are an A.N.C. comrade, anything is possible, even a get-out-of-jail-free card.\u201d\nPatricia de Lille, leader of the Independent Democrats, asked, \u201cWhat about the thousands of other prisoners that were never fairly assessed by the parole boards, even though some of them were in the final stages of terminal illness?\u201d\nJames Selfe of the Democratic Alliance said that while Mr. Shaik\u2019s medical condition was confidential, the Department of Correctional Services ought to disclose the grounds for parole in this case \u201cto dispel the notion that double standards are being applied.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/africa/04safrica.html", "title": "Jailed Zuma Ally Paroled on Medical Grounds", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}
{"date": "Mon, 10 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 About 200 conservative Iranian lawmakers signed a letter on Monday calling on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to consult them about cabinet appointments, the latest sign of a struggle among hard-liners that may limit the president\u2019s political clout as he moves to form a new government in the coming week.\nThe lawmakers\u2019 demands followed reports that Mr. Ahmadinejad had fired as many as 20 officials in Iran\u2019s Intelligence Ministry. The purge appeared to be aimed at those who disagreed with the handling of the harsh crackdown on opposition protests in the wake of the disputed June 12 presidential election.\nThe firings have exposed sharp differences among conservatives over how to deal with Iran\u2019s still defiant opposition movement. Last month, Mr. Ahmadinejad fired the intelligence minister, Gholam-Hussein Mohseni-Ejei, provoking furious criticism from many conservative lawmakers and senior clerics. Mr. Mohseni-Ejei had objected to using televised confessions of jailed protesters \u2014 widely believed even in Iran to be coerced \u2014 and since his removal, those confessions have been used in a mass trial of reformist figures.\nOther conservatives have spoken out against the torture and abuse of protesters who were detained after the election, including several who died in custody. The issue has also galvanized opposition figures, and on Sunday a new and explosive accusation emerged: male and female prisoners are said to have been raped at one detention center, according to a letter by a reformist cleric and presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi.\nAt the same time, there were signs that some opposition leaders might be choosing silence, at least for the moment, in the face of renewed threats. Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former president who provided crucial support to the opposition last month in a Friday Prayer sermon at Tehran University, indicated on his Web site on Monday that he might not deliver this Friday\u2019s sermon, though it is his turn.\nThe divisions among conservatives go well beyond the handling of the crackdown. Many lawmakers and high-ranking clerics have said they are concerned that Mr. Ahmadinejad has not shown sufficient respect for senior figures or for Parliament. They were especially disturbed by his flouting last month of a command from Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to drop a deputy, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei.\nOn Monday, the speaker of the Parliament, Ali Larijani, one of Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s most powerful critics, met with the president to discuss the lawmakers\u2019 petition. Afterward, a junior lawmaker who attended the meeting said Mr. Ahmadinejad turned the question around, saying he had been waiting to hear from the lawmakers before completing his short list of cabinet nominees.\nMr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s purge of the Intelligence Ministry appeared to be part of a long-expected bid for control by the president and his allies in the Revolutionary Guard, analysts said. Officials deemed insufficiently loyal were swept aside, including some with long experience in the counterintelligence, security and technical departments.\nWith the purge, \u201cAhmadinejad is, in effect, taking over the management of the most important security institution in the country,\u201d wrote Hassan Younesi, the son of a former intelligence minister, Ali Younesi, on his blog. He added that the ministry had never seen such a boldly political purge in its history.\nAt the same time, opposition Web sites have reported that Ahmad Salek, a cleric rumored to be under consideration for intelligence minister, is operating an unofficial intelligence-gathering service run by Ahmadinejad loyalists. Opposition sites have implicated him, along with Hussein Taeb, chief of the Basij militia, in the torture of detainees.\nMr. Salek and Mr. Taeb were among a number of high-ranking officials and clerics who have fiercely criticized opposition leaders in recent days, leading many in Iran to suspect that Mir Hussein Moussavi, the leading presidential challenger, could soon be arrested. Mr. Taeb said Sunday that Mr. Moussavi and his followers were guilty of an \u201cevil plot\u201d and did not want to see the Islamic Revolution succeed, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency.\nArresting Mr. Moussavi, a former prime minister who was close to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution, would be a bold and divisive gesture that could backfire, some Iran experts say. But others say the threats are merely aimed at silencing Mr. Moussavi and his supporters.\nIf so, they may have succeeded, at least temporarily. Mr. Moussavi, who maintains that the election was rigged, has not been heard from in several days.\nEven as some hard-line figures pushed for a more aggressive approach, others continued to make more conciliatory gestures. On Sunday, Iran\u2019s national police chief, Brig. Gen. Ismail Ahmadi Moqaddam, said abuses had taken place in at least one detention facility. On Saturday, Iran\u2019s chief prosecutor became the first senior official to acknowledge that jailed protesters had been tortured.\nBut Mr. Karroubi\u2019s assertions that detained protesters had been raped were anything but conciliatory. The accusations were detailed in a letter sent to Mr. Rafsanjani dated July 29, but were first published Sunday on the Web site of Mr. Karroubi\u2019s political party.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/middleeast/11iran.html", "title": "Iranian Lawmakers Demand Say on Cabinet, Hinting at a Rift Among Hard-Liners", "author": "ROBERT F.

Analysts say it may embolden other lawmakers, who have signaled similar intentions, to act.\n\u201cUnfortunately, Aso\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party has practiced politics completely disconnected from the people,\u201d said the lawmaker who resigned, Yoshimi Watanabe, who had served as minister of administrative reform in two previous administrations, and had become one of the most recognizable faces pressing for change in the government bureaucracy.\nOpinion polls published this week by major Japanese newspapers showed Mr. Aso\u2019s approval ratings slipping below 20 percent, a danger sign in a country where governments with ratings below 30 percent have fallen.\nDissatisfaction with his government was underscored by voters\u2019 strong rejection of free money \u2014 Mr. Aso\u2019s plan to jump-start the economy through cash handouts of at least $130 per person \u2014 as a cynical attempt to woo voters, polls showed.\nMr. Aso, who must call a general election by September, rejected pressure from Mr. Watanabe and the opposition to do so immediately. He said he would not consider dissolving Parliament\u2019s lower house and calling an election until the nation\u2019s budget was passed in April.\nThe prime minister appeared to be counting on a bounce in the polls from the cash handouts. But more than 70 percent of voters opposed them, saying they would do nothing to stimulate the overall economy, according to polls.\n\u201cVoters have already given up on him and on the party,\u201d said Naoto Nonaka, a professor of politics at Gakushuin University here.\nMembers of Mr. Aso\u2019s party \u2014 who chose him last September in the hopes of riding his coattails \u2014 appeared increasingly to be counting him out as well. Worried about their survival, they could follow Mr. Watanabe out of the party, after the budget is passed in April, to run for re-election as independents.\n\u201cMr. Watanabe is playing a political game and jumping around to draw attention, but many around him are thinking the same thing,\u201d said Mr. Nonaka, whose recent book is \u201cThe End of Liberal Democratic Party Politics.\u201d \u201cI expect we\u2019ll see even bigger developments in April or May.\u201d\nDefeat of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has led Japan since 1955 for all but 11 months, could lead to a long-expected realignment in Japan\u2019s political landscape. Senior members of the party have already publicly put out feelers to the main opposition Democratic Party.\nSmaller opposition parties \u2014 including the People\u2019s New Party, which was formed in 2005 by former members of the Liberal Democratic Party \u2014 have begun positioning themselves.\n\u201cBecause the Democratic Party is the main opposition party, the Democratic Party will inevitably be at the center of a new administration,\u201d Hisaoki Kamei, secretary general of the People\u2019s New Party, said in an interview.\nHe said that his small party was prepared to back the Democratic Party as long as it offered a clear vision, adding, \u201cTo help build this vision, we intend to say what needs to be said.\u201d\nThe Liberal Democratic Party rebuilt postwar Japan into the world\u2019s second biggest economy, but it has struggled to redefine its goals since the bursting of Japan\u2019s so-called bubble economy in the late 1980s. Since then, Japan has gone through a series of ineffective leaders, with the exception of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who, tellingly, became popular by pledging to destroy his own party.\nIn keeping with Mr. Koizumi\u2019s drive to reshape the party and government, Mr. Watanabe focused on weakening one of the central facets of Japan\u2019s postwar political system: the elite bureaucracy\u2019s practice of rewarding itself with plush jobs. Mr. Watanabe, who said he would remain an independent lawmaker for now, said he wanted to create a \u201cpublic movement\u201d by leaving the party first.\nBut some members of the governing party said Mr. Watanabe had quit not over principles, but because of self-interest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Kazuyoshi Kaneko, the minister of transport. \u201cHe\u2019s quitting because he thinks the Liberal Democratic Party will lose the next election.\u201d\nIn a television interview before Mr. Watanabe officially tendered his resignation, Mr. Aso said he was confident that no other party members would follow suit.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what he will do after leaving the Liberal Democratic Party,\u201d Mr. Aso said.\nPolls showed that Mr. Aso was less popular and considered less trustworthy than Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/world/asia/14japan.html", "title": "Japan\u2019s Governing Party Is Plunging in Polls", "author": "NORIMITSU ONISHI"}

The controversy is an embarrassment to Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who in recent years made Sir James a trusted financial adviser.\nEvents at HBOS, which grew rapidly during the housing boom that fueled much of Britain\u2019s prosperity before the crash, have come under particularly harsh scrutiny. To save HBOS last fall, the Brown government oversaw the bank\u2019s takeover by Lloyd\u2019s TSB, one of Britain\u2019s largest banks, and made the newly merged operation, now 43 percent owned by the government, a principal recipient of a bank recapitalization project that has cost British taxpayers close to $60 billion.\nOn Tuesday, four of Britain\u2019s most senior bankers, including the two men now heading HBOS, appeared before a parliamentary committee investigating the crisis and apologized for their part in the excesses that helped lead to the recession. Their apologies made front-page headlines on Wednesday and prompted one commentator, in The Times of London, to compare the bankers\u2019 contrition \u2014 and the lawmakers\u2019 relentless questioning \u2014 to \u201ca \u2018Burn the Witches\u2019 event.\u201d\nSir James, 52, was appointed by Mr. Brown to be the deputy head of the Financial Services Authority after he quit as chief executive of HBOS in 2006. He resigned barely an hour before Mr. Brown rose to face opposition tumult in the Commons over the whistle-blower case.\nOn Wednesday, the Commons\u2019 committee investigating the banking crisis released written testimony from Paul Moore, a former HBOS executive, who said he had been summarily fired by Sir James after warning that the bank, then acquiring billions of dollars in new debt, was \u201cmoving too fast.\u201d\nIn his testimony, Mr. Moore, 50, named Sir James as the \u201coriginal architect\u201d of the strategy that led HBOS into near-collapse and said that anyone \u201cnot blinded by money, power and pride\u201d knew the bank\u2019s affairs were getting out of hand.\nIn the bailout last fall, the new bank created with the takeover of HBOS received nearly $17 billion in government funds.\n\u201cSadly, no one wanted to speak up for fear of stepping out of line with the rest of the lemmings who were busy organizing themselves to run over the edge of the cliff behind the pied piper C.E.O.\u2019s and executive teams that were being paid so much to play that tune and take them in that direction,\u201d Mr. Moore said in his testimony.\nIn his resignation statement, Sir James said that while Mr. Moore\u2019s allegations had \u201cno substance,\u201d he was leaving the Financial Services Authority so as not to further complicate its work. While acknowledging that he had fired Mr. Moore, he said he had done so as part of \u201ca wider restructuring\u201d at the bank.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/europe/12london.html", "title": "British Regulator Quits as Accusations Mount in Banking Crisis", "author": "JOHN F.

Putin of Russia and Yulia V. Tymoshenko of Ukraine, which was made formal in a ceremony here on Monday.\nIn a hopeful sign, however, Mr. Putin said that Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, had been ordered to turn the gas back on, for Ukraine\u2019s internal market and for re-export. \u201cI hope transit supplies in the European direction will be fully resumed in the nearest future,\u201d he said.\nUkrainian officials have said that once shipments to the border resumed, restoring pressure in the pipelines for export elsewhere in Europe would require about 36 hours.\nAs it played out over three cold weeks, the gas shutoff left hundreds of thousands of homes in southeastern Europe without heat and shuttered hundreds of factories.\nSlovakia, alarming its neighbors, had proposed restarting an obsolete nuclear reactor to make up for the gas shortfalls.\nYet tensions remain between Russia and Ukraine. On Monday, Russia\u2019s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, signed an order imposing sanctions on countries that sold weaponry to Georgia, the former Soviet republic that Russia fought in August.\nThe sanctions would halt military and technical cooperation with such countries. Ukraine has sold weaponry to Georgia and could be harmed by the measure, since its military industry is closely entwined with Russia\u2019s as a legacy of the Soviet Union.\nBut in a sign of some softening of disagreement, at least over the gas business, the two prime ministers complimented each other graciously after the signing \u2014 a rarity in their relations.\n\u201cI would like to thank the Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia Vladimirovna Tymoshenko,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cFaced with one of the hardest situations, she took responsibility for making these important decisions.\u201d\nMs. Tymoshenko said, \u201cI am very much obliged to Vladimir Vladimirovich and his team for finding the opportunity to grant special terms for Ukraine.\u201d\nThe contracts will be valid for 10 years but adjusted to current market prices.\nThe contract provides that the price of Russian natural gas in Ukraine will be pegged to prices in Europe, which are linked to international oil prices, but with a 20 percent discount in 2009. The discount will be eliminated next year.\nUnder that formula, Ukraine could be expected to pay $208 to $240 for 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas. It paid $179.50 last year.\nRussia had initially asked for $250 but raised that to $450 in the midst of the shutoff.\nUkraine, meanwhile, accepted a transit fee that is about half the average rate in Europe, but with the understanding that it will be raised next year.\nRussia halted shipments of gas to Ukraine on Jan. 1 and then, accusing Ukraine of siphoning gas intended for export, halted shipments intended for export on Jan. 6.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/world/europe/20russia.html", "title": "Russia and Ukraine Sign Agreement on Gas", "author": "ANDREW E.

About 300 Afghan women, facing an angry throng three times larger than their own, walked the streets of the capital on Wednesday to demand that Parliament repeal a new law that introduces a range of Taliban-like restrictions on women, and permits, among other things, marital rape.\nIt was an extraordinary scene. Women are mostly illiterate in this impoverished country, and they do not, generally speaking, enjoy anything near the freedom accorded to men. But there they were, most of them young, many in jeans, defying a threatening crowd and calling out slogans heavy with meaning.\nWith the Afghan police keeping the mob at bay, the women walked two miles to Parliament, where they delivered a petition calling for the law\u2019s repeal.\n\u201cWhenever a man wants sex, we cannot refuse,\u201d said Fatima Husseini, 26, one of the marchers. \u201cIt means a woman is a kind of property, to be used by the man in any way that he wants.\u201d\nThe law, approved by both houses of Parliament and signed by President Hamid Karzai, applies to the Shiite minority only. Women here and governments and rights groups abroad have protested three parts of the law especially.\nOne provision makes it illegal for a woman to resist her husband\u2019s sexual advances. A second provision requires a husband\u2019s permission for a woman to work outside the home or go to school. And a third makes it illegal for a woman to refuse to \u201cmake herself up\u201d or \u201cdress up\u201d if that is what her husband wants.\nThe passage of the law has amounted to something of a historical irony. Afghan Shiites, who make up close to 20 percent of the population, suffered horrendously under the Taliban, who regarded them as apostates. Since 2001, the Shiites, particularly the Hazara minority, have been enjoying a renaissance.\nPresident Karzai, who relies on vast support from the United States and other Western governments to stay in power, has come under intense international criticism for signing the bill into law. Many people here suspect that he did so to gain the favor of the Shiite clergy; Mr. Karzai is up for re-election this year. Previous Afghan governments, during the Soviet era and before the arrival of the Taliban, did not impose such restrictive laws, although in practice many rural women\u2019s freedoms have long been curtailed. Rights advocates say the law for Shiites could influence a proposal for Sunnis and a draft law on violence against women.\nResponding to the outcry, Mr. Karzai has begun looking for a way to remove the most controversial parts of the law. In an interview on Wednesday, his spokesman, Homayun Hamidzada, said that the legislation was not yet law because it had not been published in the government\u2019s official register. That, Mr. Hamidzada said, means that it can still be changed. Mr. Karzai has asked his justice minister to look it over.\n\u201cWe have no doubt that whatever comes out of this process will be consistent with the rights provided for in the Constitution \u2014 equality and the protection of women,\u201d Mr. Hamidzada said.\nThe women who protested Wednesday began their demonstration with what appeared to be a deliberately provocative act. They gathered in front of the School of the Last Prophet, a madrasa run by Ayatollah Asif Mohseni, the country\u2019s most powerful Shiite cleric. He and the scholars around him played an important role in drafting the new law.\n\u201cWe are here to campaign for our rights,\u201d one woman said into a megaphone. Then the women held their banners aloft and began to chant.\nThe reaction was immediate. Hundreds of students from the madrasa, most but not all of them men, poured into the streets to confront the demonstrators.\n\u201cDeath to the enemies of Islam!\u201d the counterdemonstrators cried, encircling the women. \u201cWe want Islamic law!\u201d\nThe women stared ahead and marched.\nA phalanx of police officers, some of them women, held the crowds apart.\nAfterward, when the demonstrators had left, one of the madrasa\u2019s senior clerics came outside. Asked about the dispute, he said it was between professionals and nonprofessionals; that is, between the clerics, who understood the Koran and Islamic law, and the women calling for the law\u2019s repeal who did not.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if you are sick, you go to a doctor, not some amateur,\u201d said the cleric, Mohammed Hussein Jafaari. \u201cThis law was approved by the scholars. It was passed by both houses of Parliament. It was signed by the president.\u201d\nThe religious scholars, Mr. Jafaari conceded, were all men.\nLingering a while, Mr. Jafaari said that what was really driving the dispute was the foreigners who loomed so large over the country.\n\u201cWe Afghans don\u2019t want a bunch of NATO commanders and foreign ministers telling us what to do.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/world/asia/16afghan.html", "title": "Afghan Women Protest New Law on Home Life", "author": "DEXTER FILKINS"}

The majority of Iraqis who fled the country after the American invasion and during the sectarian violence were Sunnis.\nLawmakers and representatives of Iraq\u2019s Independent High Electoral Commission met Tuesday to try to negotiate an agreement that would satisfy all parties. The election law must still be approved by Iraq\u2019s presidency council, and details, like the allocation of seats, can be amended before then.\nAny delay of the elections beyond their scheduled date of Jan. 21 would not only be an international embarrassment but could complicate the American military\u2019s plans for withdrawal.\nThe passage of an election law was delayed 11 times, hung up largely on the question of representation of the ethnically mixed area of Kirkuk, an oil-rich region whose Kurdish population has grown substantially since the American invasion, after shrinking under years of persecution by the government of Saddam Hussein.\nWhen the election law was passed on Nov. 8, it seemed as if those differences had been resolved. But as the details of the law and the allocation of seats in Parliament became clear, familiar divisions have once again surfaced.\n\u201cUnless the seat allocation formula is reconsidered in a just manner, the people of the Kurdistan region will be compelled to boycott the election,\u201d the Kurdistan regional president, Massoud Barzani, said in a statement.\nVice President Hashemi was equally forceful in his veto threat.

The hourlong concert was a central event of Israel\u2019s annual Good Deeds Day, sponsored by an Israeli billionaire.\nAdnan al-Hindi, the leader of the camp\u2019s Popular Committee, a grass-roots group representing the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the young musicians had been exploited by the orchestra director, Wafaa Younis, for the purpose of \u201cnormalizing\u201d ties with Israel. He said by telephone that the children had been \u201cdeceived\u201d and dragged unwittingly into a political situation that \u201cserved enemy interests\u201d and aimed to \u201cdestroy the Palestinian national spirit in the camp.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a shock and a surprise to the children and their relatives,\u201d he said, adding that Ms. Younis had told the young musicians\u2019 families only that the trip to Holon was an opportunity for artistic self-expression.\nMs. Younis, from central Israel, has been traveling to Jenin every week for several years to teach music in the camp. Mr. Hindi said that the house she rented as a studio had been sealed, and that she was barred by the Popular Committee from all activity in the camp.\nMs. Younis accused camp officials of wanting to take over the orchestra to get its financing, according to The Associated Press. \u201cThey want to destroy this group,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, it\u2019s a tragedy. What did these poor, elderly people do wrong? What did these children do wrong?\u201d\nJewish suffering under the Nazis is a volatile subject in Palestinian society, where there is widespread ignorance of the details of the Holocaust and a feeling that Palestinians paid a price for it, viewing it as a main catalyst for the establishment of the Jewish state.\nIn Holon on Wednesday, it was clear that the young musicians knew little or nothing about the Holocaust or the nature of the audience that they were performing for.\nMs. Younis spoke of peace and brotherhood and said the orchestra, Strings of Freedom, had come \u201cto put love and warmth into people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\nThe Jenin refugee camp, the capital of suicide bombers to the Israelis and a symbol of resistance to the Palestinians, was the scene of a bloody battle between advancing Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen in 2002.\nMost of the Good Deed Day events were organized by Ruach Tova (Good Spirit), an Israeli organization that couples nonprofit groups with volunteers.\nMs. Younis had told Ruach Tova that she wanted to bring the youth orchestra to perform in Israel.

China later described the collision as an accident.\nDuring other, more aggressive confrontations this year, Chinese fishing vessels have menaced American surveillance ships during routine patrols. The United States insists that the intelligence-gathering missions are allowed under international law, an assertion that China has repeatedly challenged.\nChina on Wednesday played down the skirmishes, saying that both countries should increase communication to minimize potential conflict.\n\u201cOur two sides agreed to work together to avoid such incidents from happening again, since such incidents will surely have a negative impact on our bilateral relations in general,\u201d Lt. Gen. Ma Xiaotian, deputy chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army, said at a news conference on Wednesday.\nMichele Flournoy, the under secretary of defense for policy and General Ma\u2019s American counterpart in the discussions, echoed that sentiment, saying there was no reason such \u201caccidents\u201d should harm relations, even if the two countries remained at odds over the definition of international waters. \u201cWe have to put the safety of mariners first and foremost,\u201d she said in a separate news conference.\nDuring talks about North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons ambitions, Ms. Flournoy said Chinese military officials reiterated their support for United Nations Security Council sanctions that seek to punish North Korea for the detonation of a nuclear device last month. \u201cThere is very much a shared objective to getting North Korea to change course and return to a verifiable path to denuclearization,\u201d she said.\nThis month, the Security Council unanimously passed a package of sanctions that, among other things, calls upon member states to inspect suspect ships at sea, or direct them to a nearby port if they refuse. Although General Ma described North Korea\u2019s nuclear pursuits as a \u201cserious concern,\u201d he did not indicate whether China would countenance the search of the Kang Nam, a North Korean vessel en route to the Strait of Malacca that is suspected of carrying conventional weapons.\nThe United States Navy is monitoring the ship, which may be headed toward Myanmar, but North Korea has warned that interception would be seen as a declaration of war.\nEven as the two nations hailed the resumption of talks and an effort to ease longstanding mistrust, the issue of Taiwan arms sales could re-emerge as a stumbling block to increased military cooperation. Although it has made no decision, the White House is considering another round of weapons sales first proposed during the Bush administration.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/world/asia/25china.html", "title": "U.S.-China Military Talks Resume", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}

Ever since his wife said in May that she was divorcing him, calling him \u201cunwell\u201d and accusing him of gallivanting with young women, including a teenager, new questions have continued to emerge about Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s personal life, including whether high-end escorts were paid to attend parties at his official Rome residence.\nJuicy photos have also appeared, including images of attractive young women frolicking in the nude \u2014 or scantily clad on a merry-go-round \u2014 during parties at Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s Sardinian villa.\nThrough it all, Mr. Berlusconi has remained defiant. \u201cThis is how I am,\u201d he said last month. \u201cI\u2019m not going to change a thing. If they like me this way, they like me this way.\u201d\nIndeed, a well-regarded poll last week found that the prime minister\u2019s approval ratings had fallen only two points since the scandal began in May, to 49 percent, with his popularity dropping most among women and practicing Roman Catholics.\nMr. Berlusconi is famous for his ebullient personality and off-color jokes \u2014 he has repeatedly called President Obama \u201cyoung, handsome and suntanned\u201d \u2014 but news reports say his advisers are urging him to tone things down.\n\u201cThose student-like jokes that he likes to play, like stepping in front of Angela Merkel from behind the monument, he better not do that,\u201d Mr. Romano said, referring to the German chancellor, whom Mr. Berlusconi is fond of teasing.\nAnalysts wonder whether new allegations against the prime minister will emerge during the meeting of the Group of 8, representing major economies, just as they did in 1994, the year he first took office, when he was told that he was under investigation for questionable finances while he was holding a United Nations conference on crime.\nMr. Berlusconi had originally planned to host the Group of 8 on La Maddalena, an island off the coast of Sardinia, where the delegations were to be housed on a luxury cruise ship. But when the earthquake struck here on April 6, he had a new idea \u2014 to move the meeting to L\u2019Aquila in solidarity with residents and in keeping with the less luxe spirit of the financial crisis.\nWorkmen have been laboring around the clock to transform a vast Finance Police school into the summit meeting headquarters from Wednesday through Friday. World leaders, including Mr. Obama, and their delegations are expected to be housed in apartments on the grounds. The local airport has been expanded and a press center built to accommodate more than 3,000 accredited journalists. The surrounding area has been turned into a \u201cred zone,\u201d patrolled by thousands of security officers.\nSince the recent quakes, authorities have assured expected guests that the venue is sound. But they have also devised an evacuation plan in case of quakes of more than a magnitude of 4, in which people would be sent to tents until the buildings were deemed safe to re-enter. If delegations choose to leave, they will get a police escort back to Rome.\nThe choice of venue is \u201can important way to bring the most powerful in the world to the most weak,\u201d said Guido Bertolaso, the head of Italy\u2019s Civil Protection Agency, who is overseeing the rebuilding efforts and the Group of 8 meeting arrangements.\nIndeed, just a few miles from the meeting headquarters, thousands of homeless earthquake victims are still living in tents, awaiting housing that the government has pledged to build by fall. The area\u2019s economy has been devastated, with businesses, city offices, schools and the university in ruins.\nSome residents are not thrilled that the Group of 8 is coming to town. \u201cI don\u2019t know how good a choice it was,\u201d said Chiara di Crosta, 33, as she looked after her young daughter in a tent camp in downtown L\u2019Aquila on a recent afternoon. \u201cThere are more fundamental questions, like houses.\u201d\nYet Italy hopes the venue will help bring in international financing. The Culture Ministry has singled out 45 monuments, including L\u2019Aquila\u2019s most notable churches, that it hopes different countries will \u201cadopt\u201d for restoration.\nMemories are still raw from the last time Italy hosted the Group of 8, in Genoa in 2001, when one 23-year-old was killed and dozens of people were injured when the police cracked down on protesters. This time, Group of 8 protesters are holding a series of rallies in other cities ahead of the meeting.\nStefano Frezza, a spokesman for Epicentro Solidale, the L\u2019Aquila-based group coordinating the protests, said the protests in L\u2019Aquila should be peaceful. With thousands still living in tents, \u201cEveryone understands the situation in L\u2019Aquila,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wanted to add hardship to hardship.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/world/europe/07italy.html", "title": "As Premier Faces Scandal, Italy Sets Stage for G-8", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO and ELISABETTA POVOLEDO"}

Holbrooke arrives here Monday looking for ways to stop a runaway Islamist insurgency that is destabilizing Pakistan, he will find a pro-American but weak civilian government, and a powerful army unaccustomed and averse to fighting a domestic enemy.\nIn a nuclear-armed nation regarded as an ally of the United States and considered pivotal by the Obama administration to ending the war in neighboring Afghanistan, Mr. Holbrooke will face a surge of anti-American sentiment on clear display by private citizens, public officials and increasingly potent television talk shows.\nSome remedies offered by his hosts are likely to be unappealing. On almost every front, Pakistani leaders are calling for less American involvement, or at least the appearance of it.\nThe main reason for the swell in resentment here is the very strategy that the United States government considers its prime success against Al Qaeda: missile strikes delivered by remotely piloted aircraft against militants in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas.\nTo the surprise of many Pakistanis, who had been promised by their leaders that the new administration in Washington would be different, American drone aircraft fired missiles at two areas in the tribal belt just three days after President Obama\u2019s inauguration. According to the Pakistanis, as many as 21 civilians were killed by the strikes, in North and South Waziristan.\nFury at the continued airstrikes is considered one of the reasons for the poor showing of President Asif Ali Zardari in public opinion surveys.\nMany Pakistanis view Mr. Zardari as too close to his American patrons. He is widely believed to have agreed to a request from President Bush for a widening of the drone strikes, which had been conducted far more sparingly before Mr. Zardari came to power last September.\nIn an effort on Saturday to assuage an angry public, Mr. Zardari told an audience in Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province, that he would argue against the drone attacks during Mr. Holbrooke\u2019s visit. According to the Pakistani state press agency, Mr. Zardari said that the drone attacks were \u201ccounterproductive\u201d and that the \u201cday was not far away when these attacks will be stopped.\u201d\nMr. Zardari\u2019s sudden appearance in Peshawar, a city virtually under siege from the Taliban, just two days before Mr. Holbrooke\u2019s arrival was his first there since he became president.\nHe was reported to have said that the visit by Mr. Holbrooke, Mr. Obama\u2019s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, would give him the opportunity to educate the administration.\n\u201cWe will tell them fighting was no solution to the imbroglio,\u201d Mr. Zardari was quoted as having said, \u201cand let us handle it in our own way, as we know better than them as to how best the issue could be tackled.\u201d\nPakistani officials said they agreed with the American assessment that the airstrikes had killed some of the senior leadership of Al Qaeda. But the civilian casualties that have accompanied the attacks have accelerated anti-American feelings and made the Pakistani military appear feeble, they said. They argued that short-term tactical gains were likely to be outstripped by long-term strategic losses.\n\u201cEven when the real militants get killed, there is also a high probability that unarmed civilians get killed,\u201d said Farhatullah Babar, the spokesman for Mr. Zardari. \u201cPeople get galvanized and become sympathetic to the militants.\u201d\nThe best alternative, Mr. Babar and former and current military officials said, was for the Americans to share intelligence with the Pakistanis, and for the Pakistanis to carry out the attacks. If Pakistan conducted the air raids, they said, the militants could not contend that the battle against them was \u201cAmerica\u2019s war.\u201d\nAt the very least, the Pakistanis say, they will drive home to Mr. Holbrooke the need for American military aid to help fight the insurgents \u2014 in particular, helicopters and night-vision gear.\nIn a startling example of its shortcomings in counterterrorism, the Pakistani Army has been unable to thwart the FM radio signal of the leading Islamic militant in the Swat Valley, an area just 100 miles from this capital city. There, an army division of about 12,000 men has lost ground to the roughly 3,000 Taliban. The radio programs of the militant leader, Maulana Fazlullah, have proved a virulent weapon, forcing landowners to flee, terrorizing the police and spreading hatred of the government.\nA spokesman for the army, Gen. Athar Abbas, said the militant\u2019s radio broadcasts were difficult to track because they \u201cshifted from one place to another.\u201d The army is trying to get the technology to jam the transmissions but has been unable to do so, he said. In a recent briefing of Pakistani journalists, the army said it had acquired a strong transmitter from China but had not yet installed it.\nThose kinds of failures, and the fact that none of the top leaders of the Pakistani Taliban have been killed, have prompted sharp criticism of the army from politicians aligned with Mr. Zardari. In a televised interview, one such politician, Hasham Baber, a member of the Awami National Party \u2014 which controls the North-West Frontier Province \u2014 accused the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency and the army of being allies of the militants.\nEven if the United States increases military assistance for fighting the insurgency, it will be difficult to coax a better counterterrorism performance from the Pakistani Army, in part because of its deep suspicion about the United States\u2019 intentions.\nMr. Obama said last week that a central goal would be to prevent nuclear-armed Pakistan from destabilizing Afghanistan. By that, he is widely understood to have meant that the jihadists who use the tribal area as a base to attack American troops in Afghanistan, and to sweep down elsewhere in Pakistan, must be conquered.\nSome Pakistani strategic planners, however, interpret Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to send more troops to Afghanistan as a direct threat to Pakistan, and in particular to its nuclear arsenal.\nThe belief, according to a senior Pakistani military officer, is that additional forces in Afghanistan would spill over into Pakistan. \u201cAfghanistan is irrelevant,\u201d said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe American troops are designed to create a mess in the tribal areas and in Pakistan, and take the nukes.\u201d\nAnother major irritant in the bilateral relationship that could hamper cooperation from the Pakistani military stems from the decision by the Bush administration to complete a nuclear deal with India, Pakistan\u2019s archenemy. The deal permits civilian nuclear trade between India and the United States, even though India has not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\nThis enhanced relationship was interpreted as a serious snub to Pakistan, said Maleeha Lodhi, who served twice as Pakistani ambassador to the United States.\n\u201cThe Indo-U.S. deal,\u201d she said, \u201csignified to the Pakistani military that while Washington saw its ties with Pakistan in tactical terms, the strategic relationship was forged with India.\u201d\nTo overcome qualms in Pakistan about the United States, Mr. Holbrooke is likely to emphasize Washington\u2019s plans for a drastic increase in aid to the country\u2019s educational, health and judicial systems, all areas that the United States has supported in the past, but to little effect because of deep corruption.\nIn line with legislation for the assistance written by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. when he was in the Senate, Mr. Holbrooke will insist that the flow of aid depends on Pakistan\u2019s determination to act against terrorism.\nPakistanis see that condition, too, as demeaning. \u201cAn approach that treats Pakistan from the paradigm of \u2018hired help,\u2019 rather than valued ally,\u201d Ms. Lodhi wrote in a Pakistani daily paper, The News, \u201cshould be unacceptable to Islamabad.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/world/asia/09pstan.html", "title": "A Visit to a U.S. Ally, but an Increasingly Wary One", "author": "JANE PERLEZ"}
{"date": "Thu, 19 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 Before television shined its warped light on her, Jade Goody was surely destined for a life of hardship and obscurity. Crude-talking, hard-drinking, overweight, barely educated, in debt, the child of drug addicts, she appeared on the reality show \u201cBig Brother\u201d in 2002 as a kind of token lowlife.\nBut something about Ms. Goody, then 21, struck a chord \u2014 even if it was a patronizing one \u2014 in a restless nation searching for ways to allay its millennial boredom. She became a bona fide media star, a working-class Paris Hilton. Britons eagerly devoured every detail of her life, no matter how banal. They worked out to her exercise videos, bought her perfume, read her autobiography and, when she made racist remarks about an Indian actress on \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d in 2007, angrily turned against her.\nNow they are watching her die.\nMs. Goody, who has two young sons, learned she had cervical cancer last August, on camera, as she appeared in the Indian version of \u201cBig Brother.\u201d\nThe cancer has since spread to her liver, bowel and groin; on Friday, her doctors told her there was nothing more they could do.\nAnd then she told the British public.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived my whole adult life talking about my life,\u201d she explained on Sunday in The News of the World, one of the media outlets that have bought the rights to her end-of-life story. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in front of the cameras. And maybe I\u2019ll die in front of them.\u201d\nThis is reality television carried out to its most extreme, grotesque conclusion, one not even envisioned in the film \u201cThe Truman Show\u201d all those years ago. The question of why, exactly, the story is so compelling \u2014 how to negotiate the line between poignant and voyeuristic, whether newspapers are exploiting Ms. Goody or she is exploiting them \u2014 has twisted the media into knots, even as they provide daily updates on Ms. Goody\u2019s deteriorating condition and state of mind.\nThey are motivated partly by guilt. Many newspapers have been intermittently nasty about Ms. Goody, holding her up as a sorry symbol of vulgarian, instant-gratification Britain, \u201csomeone who achieved a sort of fame for having displayed her incalculable stupidity on television,\u201d as Rod Liddle wrote in The Spectator. Some people even suggested at first, as have many anti-Jade sites on the Internet, that she did not really have cancer but was just trying to get publicity.\nNow that she is dying, many of the same papers are now squirming with unease at their collusion in the endless building up, knocking down and exploitation of a woman they always counted on to increase their own sales.\nEvery time Ms. Goody, now 27, leaves the hospital, hunched in a wheelchair, her head wrapped in a scarf, the cameras are there to watch. They were there when her 21-year-old boyfriend, Jack Tweed \u2014 recently released from prison after serving time for assault, and wearing an electronic ankle bracelet \u2014 proposed to her after hearing her grim prognosis. They were there when the couple went to Harrods to pick out her wedding dress, and to Tiffany to pick out their rings.\nThe wedding is scheduled for this Sunday, and the celebrity magazine OK! has reportedly paid more than $1 million for the rights to cover it. Mr. Tweed, who has reportedly secured permission to break his court-mandated curfew so he can attend the reception, has said, \u201cShe\u2019ll be down that aisle \u2014 even in her hospital bed.\u201d Elton John has reportedly offered the use of one of his houses for their honeymoon, if there is one. The whole thing is to be filmed by the cable channel that is following Ms. Goody\u2019s cancer struggle in a program called \u201cJade\u2019s Progress.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole country will be worried and anxious about her health,\u201d Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain told reporters at his monthly news conference on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all obsessed with it \u2014 broadsheet and tabloid audiences are alike in being transfixed,\u201d said Julia Hobsbawm, chief executive of the media analysis firm Editorial Intelligence. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s doing the exploiting, but it\u2019s very, very compelling.\u201d\nSome are arguing that Jade, as everyone calls her, should reclaim some of the dignity she sold years ago by doing her dying at home, alone. \u201cPlease, please, please demand some privacy now, for your own sake and your children\u2019s,\u201d Jane Ennis, former editor of the celebrity magazine Now, where Ms. Goody had a column and appeared frequently on the cover, wrote in The Daily Mail. After the racist remarks that led to the debacle on \u201cCelebrity Big Brother,\u201d the magazine printed an article titled, \u201cJade We Hate You.\u201d\nThe alternative school of thought is that Ms. Goody, far from being a pawn, has seized control for the first time, cannily leveraging the only commodity she has ever had \u2014 her life \u2014 to secure her children\u2019s future.\n\u201cI know some people don\u2019t like what I\u2019m doing, but at this point, I don\u2019t really care what other people think,\u201d she told The News of the World.\nPerhaps she feels there is really no other choice.\n\u201cPresumably she\u2019s become desensitized to the media because, to some extent, she only exists now in front of the cameras,\u201d Ms. Hobsbawm said\nMs. Goody\u2019s publicist, Max Clifford, said that there were no plans to broadcast the moment of his client\u2019s death. He explained that she had three reasons for wanting to spend her last days in public: to earn money to leave to her children; to keep busy through the horror of dying; and to alert young women to the need to have regular tests to detect early signs of cervical cancer.\nSince Ms. Goody\u2019s diagnosis, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of British women seeking such tests, a phenomenon doctors are calling \u201cthe Jade Goody effect.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/world/europe/20britain.html", "title": "Squirming, but Watching a Dying Reality Star", "author": "SARAH LYALL"}

Many of the dead were taken to the morgue at Mutare General Hospital, or buried in mass graves, the report says.\nArmy brigades are being rotated into the diamond fields, discovered in 2006, so more soldiers can profit from the illegal trade, the report says.\nVillagers from the area, some of them children, are being forced to work in mines controlled by military syndicates and have complained of being harassed, beaten and arrested, the report says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big cash cow for the military and the police, especially since Zimbabwe is virtually bankrupt,\u201d Dewa Mavhinga, the Zimbabwean lawyer who was the main researcher for the report, said in an interview.\nMr. Mugabe, who has ruled for 29 years, is now governing with his rival, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, who spent the past three weeks in Western capitals seeking assistance for Zimbabwe\u2019s devastated economy.\nPresident Obama and European heads of state have generally declined to aid Zimbabwe\u2019s government directly, in part because of concerns that it continues to flout the rule of law.\nThe Human Rights Watch report is the latest sign of growing international concern about charges of killings and human rights abuses in the diamond fields southwest of the city of Mutare.\n\u201cWhile Zimbabwe\u2019s new power-sharing government, formed in February 2009, now lobbies the world for development aid, millions of dollars in potential government revenue are being siphoned off,\u201d the report said.\nThe World Federation of Diamond Bourses, an umbrella group of 28 bourses in 20 countries, called on its members in April not to trade diamonds that originate in the Marange deposits in Zimbabwe.\n\u201cSomewhere along the line, we have to stand up and be counted,\u201d Michael H. Vaughan, the federation\u2019s executive director, said in an interview on Friday.\nOn Sunday, representatives of the Kimberley Process, an alliance of industry, civic and government officials set up to stop the flow of so-called blood diamonds, will be traveling to Zimbabwe to explore whether the country is complying with the alliance\u2019s standards.\nA coalition of nonprofit groups is lobbying to have Zimbabwe suspended from membership in the Kimberley Process. \u201cThere\u2019s rampant smuggling out of the country,\u201d said Annie Dunnebacke of Global Witness, one of the nonprofit groups. \u201cThe military is profiting from the trade and is directly involved in the sale of the diamonds.\u201d\nAt a time when Zimbabwe is struggling to pay civil servants and soldiers a stipend of $100 a month, the extra income from diamond mining for soldiers is serving \u201cto mollify a constituency whose loyalty to ZANU-PF, in the context of ongoing political strife, is essential,\u201d the Human Rights Watch report said.\nIn December, soldiers rioted in Harare, Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, to protest pay that had become virtually worthless as inflation increased to astronomical levels. Analysts and Western diplomats said at the time that Mr. Mugabe might lose his grip on power if he were unable to sustain the patronage he had deployed for decades.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/world/africa/27zimbabwe.html", "title": "Zimbabwe\u2019s Diamond Fields Enrich Ruling Party, Report Says", "author": "CELIA W.

The United States has said it would hold talks with North Korea, but only if they quickly lead to the resumption of multilateral deliberations aimed at resolving the nuclear issue.\nThe statement by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao seemed to indicate that China was ready to take a more active role in trying to end the standoff between the United States and North Korea, but it remains unclear if he won concessions from the North that will induce Washington to enter into bilateral talks.\nKurt M. Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, is expected to hold follow-up discussions next week in Beijing and Tokyo, the State Department said.\nSince 2003, the multilateral or six-party talks \u2014 which include the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan \u2014 have been the main forum where the regional powers have tried to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions. But North Korea called the talks \u201cdead\u201d and insisted on a direct dialogue with Washington after the regional powers joined United Nations sanctions that were imposed on the North in the aftermath of its nuclear test in May.\nMr. Wen\u2019s statement came at a news conference following a high-level meeting here at the Great Hall of the People, in which the leaders of China, Japan and South Korea pledged to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and forge closer ties with one another.\nThe Chinese prime minister, who had just returned from the three-day visit to North Korea, said that its neighbor was eager to improve relations with the United States, Japan and South Korea, and that he had hopes for an early resumption of the six-party talks.\nStanding alongside Japan\u2019s new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, and the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, Mr. Wen pressed for something to be done quickly.\n\u201cIf we miss this opportunity, then we may have to make even more efforts further down the road,\u201d he said.\nDuring his visit to North Korea, Mr. Wen agreed to ship economic aid and increase economic exchanges with the North, raising fears in South Korea and Japan that the package rewarded North Korea prematurely and would undermine United Nations sanctions.\nAt a separate meeting between Japan and South Korea last week in Seoul, the leaders of the two countries vowed to enforce United Nations sanctions against North Korea until they had clear evidence North Korea had abandoned its nuclear weapons ambitions.\nBut on Saturday, China, Japan and South Korea did not discuss their apparent differences in approach and emphasized that they would cooperate to resolve the nuclear issue.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/world/asia/11korea.html", "title": "Chinese Premier Calls for Dialogue Between U.S. and North Korea", "author": "DAVID BARBOZA"}
{"date": "Mon, 09 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Even as C.I.A. drone aircraft pound Al Qaeda in Pakistan\u2019s tribal region, there is growing concern among American military and intelligence officials about different militants\u2019 havens in Pakistan that they fear could thwart American military efforts in Afghanistan this year.\nAmerican officials are increasingly focusing on the Pakistani city of Quetta, where Taliban leaders are believed to play a significant role in stirring violence in southern Afghanistan.\nThe Taliban operations in Quetta are different from operations in the mountainous tribal areas of Pakistan that have until now been the main setting for American unease. But as the United States prepares to pour as many as 30,000 additional troops into Afghanistan, military and intelligence officials say the effort could be futile unless there is a concerted effort to kill or capture Taliban leaders in Quetta and cut the group\u2019s supply lines into Afghanistan.\nFrom Quetta, Taliban leaders including Mullah Muhammad Omar, a reclusive, one-eyed cleric, guide commanders in southern Afghanistan, raise money from wealthy Persian Gulf donors and deliver guns and fresh fighters to the battlefield, according to Obama administration and military officials.\n\u201cWhen their leadership is where you cannot get to them, it becomes difficult,\u201d said Gen. Dan K. McNeill, who until June was the senior American commander in Afghanistan and recently retired. \u201cYou are restrained from doing what you want to do.\u201d\nThe Taliban leaders have operated from Quetta for several years, but the increasing violence in southern Afghanistan suggests that the flow of arms, fighters and money there from the Pakistani sanctuary may be increasing.\nQuetta, the capital of Baluchistan Province, abuts the provinces in southern Afghanistan where the war\u2019s fiercest fighting has occurred. American intelligence officials said that the dozen or so militants who were thought to make up the Taliban leadership in the area were believed to be hiding either in sprawling Afghan refugee camps near Quetta or in some of the city\u2019s Afghan neighborhoods.\nAmerican and other Western officials have long said they suspect that Pakistani security services do little to address the presence of senior Taliban commanders in Quetta. Many of the officials would speak only on condition of anonymity because of the delicate intelligence and diplomatic issues involved.\nOne former intelligence official with years of experience in Afghanistan and Pakistan likened the situation to America\u2019s difficulties during the Vietnam War, when Vietnamese guerrillas used a haven in Cambodia to bring in fresh troops and weapons.\nFor the past year, the top American goal in Pakistan has been to press the national government in Islamabad for help elsewhere, in killing and capturing Qaeda fighters in the tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan, who intelligence analysts say pose a direct threat to the United States.\nBut NATO generals and diplomats have long complained that the command and control of Taliban fighters, distinct from Qaeda insurgents, trace back to southern Pakistan, and that Pakistani security services ignore the threat. Pakistani officials have said they lack good intelligence about the specific locations of Taliban leaders, assertions that some American intelligence operatives greet with some skepticism.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made progress going into the tribal areas and North-West Frontier Province against Al Qaeda, but we have not had a counterpart war against the Quetta shura,\u201d said a senior Obama administration official, using the term for the Taliban\u2019s ruling council. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has said the Obama administration will adopt a tough love approach to Pakistan: threatening to cut off military aid to Islamabad unless it carries out a crackdown on militants operating throughout the country.\n\u201cPakistan will act against any individuals involved with Al Qaeda or the Taliban about whom we have actionable intelligence,\u201d Husain Haqqani, Pakistan\u2019s ambassador to the United States, said in an interview. \u201cThe problem is we do not always get actionable intelligence in Quetta in particular. It\u2019s a very messy area.\u201d\nSome current and former American intelligence officials are sympathetic to difficulties that the government in Islamabad faces in rounding up Taliban leaders. Baluchistan has long been an area hostile to government control, and even Pakistani spies have difficulty building a network of sources there, they said.\nLast week, gunmen in Quetta kidnapped an American working for the United Nations in the city and killed his driver, leading Pakistani security officials to lock down transit routes in and out of the city.\nAides to Richard C. Holbrooke, Mr. Obama\u2019s special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American military commander in the region, said the issue of crippling the Taliban leadership was getting more attention from their bosses. Mr. Holbrooke is paying his first visit to the region this week in his new job.\nThe influence of the Taliban leadership over operations on the ground in Afghanistan is a matter of some debate among American commanders and intelligence analysts.\n\u201cThe Quetta shura is extremely important,\u201d said Lt. Gen. David W. Barno, a retired former commander of American forces in Afghanistan who is advising General Petraeus on a strategic review of his region, including Pakistan and Afghanistan. \u201cThey are the intellectual and ideological underpinnings of the Taliban insurgency.\u201d\nBut Gen. David D. McKiernan, currently the top military commander in Afghanistan, said in a speech in Washington in November that any assessment that said the Quetta shura\u2019s dictates were closely followed by field commanders \u201cgives the Taliban far too much credit for coherency at the operational and strategic level.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have that,\u201d the general added.\nThat may be true, intelligence analysts say, but few disagree that weakening the Taliban leadership in Pakistan, coupled with achieving battlefield gains with the larger American-led force on the ground in southern Afghanistan, could begin to reverse the adverse momentum in the war.\n\u201cIt would remove the ideological standard-bearer, which also provides links to external financing in the gulf,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t erase the rural-based insurgency and narcotics trade in Afghanistan, but the notion is, if you can disrupt them at the top levels, it will have an impact at the bottom, down in the provinces.\u201d\nEven more intriguing, American officials say, is this prospect: diminishing the Taliban leadership in Quetta and weakening its influence over Taliban fighters in southern Afghanistan might open the way to engage more moderate Taliban politically.\n\u201cThe challenge has always been to exploit some cleavages between the top leadership, which we\u2019ve ruled out of bounds in terms of reconciliation, and the layers one or two layers beneath them,\u201d said Daniel Markey, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former South Asia specialist for the State Department.\nIn recent years, there have been some significant successes in the hunt for Taliban leaders. Pakistani operatives tracked Mullah Dadullah, a senior aide to Mullah Omar, as he crossed the Afghan border in May 2007, and he was later killed by American and Afghan troops.\nYet most of the arrests in Pakistan have coincided with visits by senior American officials.\nThe arrest of Mullah Obeidullah, the former Taliban defense minister, in Quetta in February 2007 coincided with the visit of Vice President Dick Cheney to Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is unclear whether Mullah Obeidullah is still in Pakistani custody or was secretly released as part of a prisoner exchange to free Pakistan\u2019s ambassador to Afghanistan, who was kidnapped last February and released three months later.\nMullah Rahim, the Taliban\u2019s top commander in Helmand Province, was arrested in Quetta last summer two weeks after Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a top C.I.A. officer visited Islamabad to confront Pakistani leaders with evidence of ties between the country\u2019s powerful spy service and militants operating in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas. But an American intelligence official said last week that Mullah Rahim was no longer in custody.\n\u201cThe dilemma at the moment,\u201d said Seth Jones, a terrorism analyst at the RAND Corporation, \u201cis that some elements of the Pakistani government continue to support the Taliban as a proxy organization in Afghanistan.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/world/asia/10quetta.html", "title": "Taliban Haven in Pakistani City Raises Fears", "author": "ERIC SCHMITT and MARK MAZZETTI"}

Lukashenko, on Tuesday pardoned an American lawyer at the center of a 16-month dispute between Belarus and the United States, in a push to fully restore relations between the two countries.\nDuring a meeting with members of the United States Congress, Mr. Lukashenko agreed to free Emanuel E. Zeltser, who was serving a three-year sentence for industrial espionage and forgery. American diplomats protested Mr. Zeltser\u2019s mysterious arrest and closed trial, and they pressed for his release on humanitarian grounds, saying he had fallen gravely ill in prison.\n\u201cI am glad about my freedom,\u201d Mr. Zeltser told The Associated Press by telephone on leaving the prison clinic in the eastern town of Mogilyov. He was met by American officials and was to travel with them to the United States Embassy in Minsk, the capital, The A.P. reported. During the morning meeting, Mr. Lukashenko cast the pardon as a conciliatory gesture, and he appealed to the United States delegation to respond by lifting three-year-old economic sanctions against Belarus.\nMr. Lukashenko \u201ccould not have been more accommodating\u201d toward his American visitors, something that has not been true in the past, said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, a member of the delegation. Senator Cardin said the United States would lift the sanctions when Belarus showed progress in political reforms and human rights.\nPresident George W. Bush imposed sanctions after the 2006 presidential elections in Belarus, when the police cracked down harshly on antigovernment demonstrators. Belarus responded by expelling the American ambassador and recalling its own envoy from Washington.\nThe pardon comes as Belarus, once Moscow\u2019s most loyal post-Soviet ally, tacks sharply to the West. For almost a year, Mr. Lukashenko has been making moves to accommodate Western criticism, like granting amnesty to a series of political prisoners. This spring, Belarus was invited to join the European Union\u2019s Eastern Partnership, and it received an additional International Monetary Fund loan of $1 billion, increasing its total pledge to $3.4 billion.\nTension has been rising meanwhile between Belarus and Moscow, after top Russian officials criticized Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s economic policies and imposed a painful ban on imports of Belarussian dairy products. Belarus responded last month by boycotting a long-planned ceremony to introduce a joint military force between Russia and its closest allies.\nMr. Lukashenko\u2019s overtures on Tuesday fit squarely into that pattern, said a Western diplomat with knowledge of the meeting. \u201cI do suspect a good deal of what the president said today was directed as much to Moscow as it was to Washington or Minsk,\u201d the diplomat said.\nThe decision brings an end to a bizarre legal case. Mr. Zeltser and his personal assistant, Vladlena Funk, were arrested at the Minsk airport on an airplane belonging to a Russian oligarch, Boris A. Berezovsky. Mr. Berezovsky has accused Mr. Zeltser of using a forged will to steal the assets of his former partner, but he said he had no involvement in the arrest.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/world/europe/01belarus.html", "title": "Belarus Leader Pardons American Lawyer at Center of Dispute", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}

{"date": "Tue, 30 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 From the moment the coup in Honduras unfolded over the weekend, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez had his playbook ready. He said Washington\u2019s hands may have been all over the ouster, claiming that it financed President Manuel Zelaya\u2019s opponents and insinuating that the C.I.A. may have led a campaign to bolster the putschists.\nBut President Obama firmly condemned the coup, defusing Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s charges. Instead of engaging in tit-for-tat accusations, Mr. Obama calmly described the coup as \u201cillegal\u201d and called for Mr. Zelaya\u2019s return to office. While Mr. Ch\u00e1vez continued to portray Washington as the coup\u2019s possible orchestrator, others in Latin America failed to see it that way.\n\u201cObama Leads the Reaction to the Coup in Honduras,\u201d read the front-page headline on Tuesday in Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, one of the most influential newspapers in Brazil, whose ties to Washington are warm.\nIn recent years, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez has often seemed to outmaneuver Washington on such issues. He exploited the Bush administration\u2019s low standing after the Iraq war and its tacit approval for the brief coup that toppled him in 2002, and blamed the United States for ills in Venezuela and across the region.\nNow such tactics may get less traction, as the Obama administration presses for a multilateral solution to the crisis in Honduras by turning to the Organization of American States. In doing so, Mr. Obama is moving away from policies that had isolated the United States in parts of the hemisphere.\n\u201cWith Honduras, the Obama administration has taken the mainstream road that is more in sync with other countries in the region,\u201d said Peter DeShazo, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nHonduras, which has long had close ties to Washington, has more recently emerged as a proxy for the interests of both Venezuela and the United States. With subsidized oil, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez lured Honduras into his leftist alliance, the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas. Meanwhile, the United States did not cut off development and military aid to Honduras, in an attempt to maintain influence there.\nBut while Mr. Ch\u00e1vez has allies in Bolivia and Ecuador who succeeded in changing constitutions to stay in office longer \u2014 following his example in Venezuela \u2014 his intervention in Honduras heightened tension in that country. Reports that Venezuela sent a plane to Honduras last week with election material for a referendum at the heart of Mr. Zelaya\u2019s clash with the Supreme Court stirred considerable unease there.\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez portrays his support for Mr. Zelaya as another example of championing his brand of democracy, which often centers on strong presidencies at the expense of other branches of government. But some countries in Latin America are resisting the trend of allowing leaders to extend their stay in office.\nIn Colombia, for instance, President \u00c1lvaro Uribe, a conservative populist and an American ally, is facing difficulties in a push to allow him to run for a third term. And in Argentina, the once popular former president, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, admitted defeat this week in congressional elections, throwing into doubt hopes for him and his wife, President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, to extend their dynasty in the next presidential election.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Obama is seeking to engage Brazil more deeply, reportedly floating the appointment of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s leftist president, as head of the World Bank. The move, if it materializes, would break the tradition of nominating an American to the post and could bolster support for Washington-based multilateral institutions while blunting Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s attempts to create his own rival institutions.\nDoing this while largely ignoring Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s taunts holds risks for Mr. Obama, particularly if information comes to light showing that there is some truth in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s claims.\nThe Venezuelan president will not forget that the C.I.A. had knowledge of the coup that ousted him in 2002 yet did nothing to prevent it, and that Washington has a recent history of providing aid to groups that are critical of his government, opening the United States to charges of destabilization.\nMoreover, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s antiestablishment rhetoric, aimed at elites in Washington and elsewhere, still resounds among many people here in Latin America.\nBut for now, at least, Mr. Obama\u2019s nonconfrontational diplomacy seems to have caught Mr. Ch\u00e1vez off balance. \u201cCh\u00e1vez is beginning to understand that he\u2019s dealing with someone with a very different approach than his predecessor,\u201d said Michael Shifter, vice president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy research group.\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s outsize role in the Honduras crisis, which involved threats of war if Venezuela\u2019s Embassy in Honduras were searched, belies the limits of Venezuela\u2019s influence in the hemisphere as the United States recalibrates its policies in a way that evokes the pragmatic diplomacy of the region\u2019s other power, Brazil.\nAfter the dust settles in Honduras, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s alliance will still include some of the region\u2019s poorest and most conflict-ridden nations, like Bolivia and Nicaragua, with larger countries choosing other development paths.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s threats of belligerence in Central America led one opposition party here, Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica, to issue a statement on Monday that was full of irony: \u201cHugo Ch\u00e1vez has become the George Bush of Latin America.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/world/americas/01venez.html", "title": "Obama\u2019s Stance Deflects Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Finger-Pointing", "author": "SIMON ROMERO"}
{"date": "Sat, 27 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CAIRO \u2014 Saad Hariri, the son of Lebanon\u2019s slain former prime minister and the leader of its Western-aligned parliamentary majority, will serve as Lebanon\u2019s next prime minister, the nation\u2019s president announced Saturday.\nMr. Hariri, 39, who was thrust into a leadership role when his father, Rafik, was assassinated in 2005, will now begin assembling a cabinet to help manage a state that has been plagued by war, deep political divisions and debt of more than $50 billion.\nHe has already said he would assemble a unity government that would include members of the opposition, although it was unclear if the minority alliance led by Hezbollah, which remains the nation\u2019s most powerful political and military force, would hold the veto power it did in the last government.\nThe announcement of Mr. Hariri\u2019s ascension to prime minister suggests that the nation may be entering a period of political calm and stability. Political analysts said that his selection indicated that there must have been an agreement between the nation\u2019s adversarial factions \u2014 as well as between Saudi Arabia, which supports Mr. Hariri, and Syria, which supports the opposition.\nThe two most contentious issues are likely to be sidelined or at least dealt with quietly. One involves the majority\u2019s earlier call for disarming Hezbollah. The other involves support for a tribunal investigating the killing of Mr. Hariri\u2019s father, which Hezbollah and its allies oppose.\n\u201cBringing him on is part of a consensus,\u201d said Karim Makdessi, a professor of political science at American University in Beirut. \u201cHe is coming in with regional agreement, as part of the larger Saudi-Syrian agreement.\u201d\nMr. Hariri was tapped to form the next government after receiving the votes of the 71-member majority coalition and 14 votes from the opposition. There are 128 seats in Parliament.\n\u201cAccording to the Constitution, and after the president consulted with the speaker of Parliament and parliamentarians, he summoned Saad Hariri and tasked him with forming a new government,\u201d said a statement released by President Michel Suleiman.\nMr. Hariri\u2019s selection was set after days of consultation among Lebanon\u2019s various political factions and a private meeting between Mr. Hariri and the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah.\nMr. Hariri and his political allies managed to edge out the Hezbollah-led alliance, which is aligned with Iran and Syria, taking a majority of seats in Parliament in the elections earlier this month.\nWhile the campaign was heated, the postelection period has proven conciliatory. Immediately after the election, Mr. Nasrallah said he accepted its results, and Mr. Hariri has since sounded a more tempered note, especially on the matter of Hezbollah\u2019s weapons.\nDuring the campaign, his candidates said they would fight to disarm Hezbollah, a red line for the group, but since then Mr. Hariri has said that the issue will be taken up only in the context of the national dialogue, a continuing formal process.\nIt was unclear how Mr. Hariri would handle the issue of the tribunal and how far Lebanon might go in helping with prosecutions. Initial reports by the first investigator pointed a finger at Syria, which has denied involvement in the killing.\nMr. Hariri\u2019s cabinet choices as well are expected to be the product of behind-the-scenes negotiating. While he has said his government will include members of the opposition, it was not yet clear if they would have enough cabinet seats to wield veto power.\nLebanese newspapers have reported that the likely outcome would be a cabinet composed of 30 ministers, with 16 for the majority, 10 representing the minority and 4 ministers aligned with the president.\nWhile Mr. Hariri\u2019s appointment may point to stability, Mr. Makdessi, the political scientist, said questions remained about the management of the state. It was likely, he said, that in the short term, Western institutions, like the World Bank, and Western donors, like France and the United States, would try to offer support to the new Hariri government.\n\u201cThe question is, will the political leaders put in respected technocrat types who can encourage a real policy debate?\u201d he said. \u201cOr is this just posturing, and everybody will go back to distributing services around to their own? I am not optimistic.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/world/middleeast/28lebanon.html", "title": "Lebanon Chooses Saad Hariri as Premier", "author": "MICHAEL SLACKMAN"}
{"date": "Tue, 03 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky appeared in a Moscow courtroom on Tuesday to face new charges in a politically fraught trial that could prolong his time in prison by more than two decades.\nMr. Khodorkovsky, the former billionaire owner of Yukos Oil, and a former business partner, Platon A. Lebedev, are accused of laundering more than $20 billion and embezzling hundreds of millions of tons of oil at a time when Yukos was Russia\u2019s largest private company. The charges carry a maximum sentence of more than 20 years in prison.\nThe bespectacled Mr. Khodorkovsky, his head shaved, arrived at the court amid a throng of police officers and journalists on Tuesday morning for preliminary hearings. It was the first time he had appeared in public since 2005, when he was convicted of fraud and tax evasion, given an eight-year sentence and sent to a Siberian prison.\nHis supporters roundly denounced that trial as a legal farce orchestrated by the Kremlin to eliminate Mr. Khodorkovsky, a potentially powerful opponent of Vladimir V. Putin, who was then Russia\u2019s president. Mr. Khodorkovsky and his supporters have similarly accused Mr. Putin, now prime minister, and his allies of inventing the new charges to keep Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev behind bars indefinitely.\nKarinna Moskalenko, one of Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s lawyers, called the charges against her client \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cgroundless\u201d and criticized the conduct of the first day\u2019s proceedings, in which Judge Viktor Danilkin rejected a series of motions by the defense.\nDefense lawyers sought to remove the two main prosecutors in the trial, who were also prosecutors in Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s first trial, accusing them of bias. But Judge Danilkin indicated that they would remain in place.\nThe court also denied a defense request to free the defendants from the glass-and-steel box they will be enclosed in for the duration of the trial, a practice that is common at trials in Russia but that lawyers say contravenes international law.\nTuesday\u2019s hearing was closed to the press, but in a statement posted on his Web site, Mr. Khodorkovsky accused prosecutors of trying to \u201ccomplicate the essence of the case in order to confuse the court and society.\u201d\nHe added, however, that he would \u201cnot speak about the politically motivated nature of the process in open hearings so as not to complicate the shocking simplicity of the case\u201d \u2014 presumably alluding to the facts of the case itself.\nThe preliminary hearings are to continue Wednesday, but it is unclear when the actual trial, which court officials have promised will be open to journalists, will begin. Lawyers for Mr. Khodorkovsky said the trial could last as long as half a year.\nThe proceedings are taking place at the Khamovnichesky Regional Court, a crumbling structure of brick and stucco that is wedged between two luxury apartment complexes not far from the United States Embassy and Mr. Putin\u2019s offices.\nRiot police officers set up cordons blocking those without press or court credentials from approaching the building. Several dozen supporters of Mr. Khodorkovsky gathered in a small square a few blocks away for an unsanctioned protest. The police detained four who had broken into shouts of \u201cFree Khodorkovsky,\u201d according to witnesses.\nSergei Davidis, a member of the opposition movement Solidarity, praised Mr. Khodorkovsky for choosing to stay in Russia to fight several years ago, rather than leave when it became clear that he might be arrested. \u201cIn addition to being a symbol of repression, illegality and oppression of civil society,\u201d Mr. Davidis said, \u201che is simply a living human being, who is behaving very bravely.\u201d\nThe police seemed unfazed by some protesters, who wrote slogans in colored chalk on the pavement calling for Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s release. One read, \u201cDown With Legal Nihilism,\u201d a slogan that Dmitri A. Medvedev voiced shortly after taking over as president last year.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/europe/04moscow.html", "title": "New Trial of Ex-Tycoon Begins in Russia", "author": "MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ"}

Gates descended into an underground silo in this sub-Arctic outpost on Monday to deliver the message to North Korea \u2014 and his critics in Congress \u2014 that the United States had plenty of interceptors to shoot down an enemy missile should the North launch an attack.\n\u201cWe have a good capability here,\u201d Mr. Gates said after clambering down the stairs of the silo to view one of 16 interceptor missiles designed to stop a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile before it reaches, theoretically, San Francisco or Hawaii. \u201cKnowing that we have this capability and that it becomes more effective each passing day should be a source of comfort to the American people in an uncertain world.\u201d\nThe defense secretary, who is not normally a theatrical man, engaged in the showmanship in an attempt to soothe those in Congress who have complained that his proposed $1.2 billion worth of cuts in the missile defense budget are risky at a time when North Korea has just tested another nuclear device and continues to launch missiles.\nIn Mr. Gates\u2019s proposed budget, plans for 44 interceptors here in Alaska and at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California would be reduced to 30, which Mr. Gates maintains is adequate for now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a forever decision,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cAnd if capabilities in one of these rogue states should develop faster, or in a more worrisome way than anybody anticipates right now, then I think the way is open in the future to add to the number of silos and interceptors up here.\u201d\nMr. Gates, who has sought a middle ground between critics of the cuts and those who say the threat from Pyongyang is hyped and that he has not cut nearly enough, said the North Korean test had had the temporary effect of muffling skeptics of missile defense over all.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard much out of those folks lately,\u201d Mr. Gates said.\nEarlier in the day, during a four-hour stop in the Philippines, Mr. Gates said that North Korea might be preparing to launch another long-range missile that would be theoretically able to reach Alaska and Hawaii as well as American military targets in Japan and Guam.\n\u201cWe have seen some signs that they may be doing something with another Taepodong-2 missile, but at this point it\u2019s not clear what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Mr. Gates said, referring to North Korea\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile. He made his remarks during a joint news conference in Manila with Gilberto C. Teodoro Jr., the Philippine secretary of national defense.\nOver the weekend, an American official confirmed South Korean news reports of indications that the North was preparing to ship an intercontinental ballistic missile toward a testing site on the Sea of Japan, a sign that the reclusive government of Kim Jong-il may be planning another launching. Monday was the first time that the defense secretary acknowledged the possibility publicly.\nMr. Gates stopped in the Philippines en route to Alaska from Singapore, where he had spent three days at a regional defense conference.\nDuring the conference, Mr. Gates raised the idea in a meeting with the defense ministers of Japan and South Korea to take a tougher approach toward the North, including the prospect of building up American defenses in the region should continuing six-nation diplomatic talks with North Korea fail.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/world/asia/02korea.html", "title": "Gates Says North Korea May Test Another Missile", "author": "ELISABETH BUMILLER"}
{"date": "Thu, 03 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 For Afghans, the change in tone was unmistakable. Unlike Bush-era speeches pledging unending support, President Obama suddenly introduced a timeline and a period of 18 months before the start of a drawdown of troops.\nThe timetable set off alarm here. It was the subject of television discussions and journalists\u2019 questions to the American ambassador, Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired lieutenant general, as well as to Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander of American forces here.\nIf Tuesday night was about President Obama sending a message to the American public that the war in Afghanistan would not be open-ended, then Wednesday in Kabul was about reassuring the Afghans of America\u2019s long-term commitment.\nTo underscore that, General Eikenberry signed an agreement with the Afghan foreign minister, Rangin Dadfar Spanta, at a ceremony to open the first United States consulate in Afghanistan in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, with another planned in the city of Herat.\n\u201cI want to emphasize that we have a very comprehensive approach and a long-term friendship and partnership with Afghanistan,\u201d General Eikenberry said. President Obama discussed further assistance in energy, water management, mines, agriculture and improvement of the civil service in his video conference call on Tuesday with President Hamid Karzai, he added.\nHe explained to the mostly Afghan journalists gathered that when the drawdown begins in 18 months, the number of troops on the ground would be as much as 35,000 more than at present and the Afghan forces stronger.\nMr. Spanta said he was reassured in an hourlong call on Tuesday with his counterpart, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. But he admitted that the 18-month timeline for the start of a transition to Afghan authority had served something of a shock therapy to the Afghan government.\n\u201cCan we do it?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the main question. This is not done in a moment. It is a process. They have to have strategic patience with us.\u201d\nIn a clear sign of his government\u2019s uneasiness at the flagging American enthusiasm for the Afghan war, Mr. Spanta said he had just presented a proposal to Mr. Karzai to work out a new strategic partnership with the United States to secure the kind of predictable, long-term assistance that close American allies like Israel and Egypt enjoy.\nAll parties involved agreed that a great deal of the job ahead was about managing perceptions.\n\u201cWe have to manage the public,\u201d said a senior Afghan government aide, speaking anonymously so he could talk more freely.\nPresident Obama was very much speaking to the American public in his speech, he said. American military officials had assured them that the 18-month timeline was more for the American public opinion than any unmovable deadline for the Afghans.\nThe Afghans had to persuade their own public, the aide said. \u201cOur own problem is that people have a war-torn mentality; they will side with the winner, and we have to show them that the Afghan government can be the winner,\u201d he said.\nThe Taliban jumped in with their own draft of reality. President Obama was ignoring the interests of his own people, who were suffering an economic downturn, the group said in an e-mail message. \u201cIt clearly indicates that the United States has broad, long-term, brazen plans not only for Afghanistan but also for the region,\u201d said the statement, bearing the heading of the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan.\nThe Taliban are prepared for a long and patient resistance against the increase of American troops, the statement said, warning that sending more troops will only lead to more casualties for NATO and American troops and cause more Afghan civilian casualties.\nFor Mr. Karzai, who is under exceptionally strong pressure to choose a clean and competent cabinet, and to move decisively to combat corruption, the speech itself was not overly harsh. \u201cTough love,\u201d one aide called it. Far stronger words are being used in private to push for reforms and the appointment of effective minister and officials, one Western official said.\nOne idea that has raised concern in the Karzai government was a plan to bypass the central government and give direct assistance to effective regional governors and ministers, and Mr. Spanta soundly rejected the idea.\nMr. Karzai, who has been smarting ever since he was forced to accept that he did not win the presidential election outright, avoided any comment on the president\u2019s speech.\nA statement from the presidential palace stated only that the government welcomed President Obama\u2019s new strategy for the support it offered in development and training for Afghan institutions and in protecting the Afghan people, and commended it for the recognition that terrorists were operating in the region beyond Afghanistan\u2019s borders in Pakistan.\n\u201cAfghanistan will spare no effort in achieving the above objectives,\u201d it said.\nMr. Spanta was the only minister who commented on the speech. He praised Mr. Obama\u2019s comments pinpointing that Afghanistan suffered from extremist safe havens in Pakistan, the first time an American president had stated it so publicly that the center of terrorism was across the border in Pakistan, Mr. Spanta said. \u201cThis is the first time we heard that from the president,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a tremendous change and progress.\u201d\nBut for some it was not enough. \u201cFaced with a surge the Taliban will go to Pakistan,\u201d said Nader Khan Kutawaisi, a member of Parliament from Paktika province, which borders Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas. \u201cIt is better to concentrate on their safe havens. As everyone knows they have a big headquarters in Quetta and shadow governors living there and I know people went to congratulate one governor for Id,\u201d he said, referring to Id al-Adha, the Muslim holiday celebrated last week.\nYet generally Afghan officials have commended the new strategy \u2014 much of which has already been in place since General McChrystal took command for six months \u2014 to lower civilian casualties, protect the Afghan people, train more Afghan forces and hand over more responsibility to them.\nIn particular, those officials pitted on the front line against the Taliban insurgents said a rapid surge of 30,000 troops this winter was desperately needed, since Afghan forces could not fight off the current insurgency on their own.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good idea,\u201d said a senior security official who has been in the forefront of tracking Al Qaeda and Taliban since 2001. The United States had very good human intelligence on Taliban on both sides of the border in Afghanistan and Pakistan but they did not have enough good fighters in the Afghan army and police, he said.\n\u201cThey need the Americans,\u201d he said. A surge of extra forces could undercut the insurgency in six months since many of the Taliban were ready to negotiate and could be persuaded to swap sides with a concerted effort, he said.\nIn Kabul, an increase in troops was generally seen as a gesture of welcome strength. Yet in the south, where the civilian cost has been highest and there is a deep weariness of the war, the mood has been generally against an increase in troops since many fear it would only increase the civilian cost. The test would be in how the extra troops perform, one government official said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/asia/04afghan.html", "title": "Afghans See Sharp Shift in U.S. Tone", "author": "CARLOTTA GALL"}

But Mr. Abbas, 74, spoke of a starting a new political battle and of perseverance in the pursuit of an independent Palestinian state.\nHe said that \u201con this occasion,\u201d he did not want to talk about his \u201cwish not to run in the upcoming elections.\u201d Instead, in a 45-minute address to supporters of his Fatah movement, he focused on the tough challenges ahead and called for reconciliation with Hamas, the opposing Palestinian faction.\nHe said it was time for the Palestinians to reach their goal of an independent state, adding that \u201cdesperation will never reach into our hearts.\u201d\nHe said that the Palestinians remained strong because of their \u201csteadfastness\u201d and the justice of their cause.\n\u201cThe whole world supports a Palestinian state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now embarking on a tough political battle,\u201d he added, to set the borders of such a state and to resolve other core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, like the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian refugees.\nHe reiterated his stance that there would be no return to negotiations with Israel in the absence of a complete settlement freeze. And he called on Hamas to join forces in the Palestinian national endeavor and to accept an Egyptian-brokered reconciliation deal with Fatah.\nAmid internal pressures and disappointment at the Obama administration\u2019s failure to extract a freeze, Mr. Abbas announced last week that he would not compete for a second term as president in elections he had called for Jan. 24. But it is far from clear that the presidential and parliamentary elections will take place on time because Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, says it will not cooperate.\nIn recent days, aides to Mr. Abbas, who is considered a reliable and moderate leader by the West, suggested that without some diplomatic progress he might resign, leading to concerns that the Palestinian Authority could fall apart.\nThe rally took place in the grounds of the Mukata, the presidential headquarters in this West Bank city where Mr. Arafat became ill in 2004. He died in a Paris hospital, but his body was flown back here and buried in the compound amid frenzied scenes of adoration and chaos.\nMr. Abbas does not inspire the same passion among his followers, many of whom attribute much of his popularity and credibility to his long association with Mr. Arafat.\nNaji Daraghmeh, who came to the rally from a village near Nablus in the northern West Bank, said, \u201cI do not believe there are people who understand the Palestinian cause like those who worked by Arafat\u2019s side.\u201d\n\u201cWe hope Abu Mazen will continue as our leader,\u201d he added, referring to Mr. Abbas, \u201cbecause he is from that group.\u201d\nA large vinyl balloon floated above the crowd with side-by-side portraits of Mr. Abbas and Mr. Arafat. Outside the Mukata, a huge banner with a full-length portrait of Mr. Abbas ran down a building, and posters pasted on the walls bore the words \u201cWe renew our support for Abu Mazen.\u201d\nMr. Abbas\u2019s authority has been limited to the West Bank since Hamas took over Gaza in 2007. There were no rallies commemorating the anniversary of Mr. Arafat\u2019s death in Gaza, illustrating the depth of the Palestinian schism.\nThose who came out in support of Mr. Abbas in Ramallah seemed confused about what would happen if he were to leave office. Some said nobody could replace him, while others said there were many people who could, but none who had his political experience. Several also cast doubt on his threat to leave the political scene.\n\u201cIf people back him, he will never leave,\u201d said Nimeh Dalaysheh, who came from the nearby Jelazoun refugee camp with her toddler.\nMr. Daraghmeh, from the village near Nablus, said he thought that Mr. Abbas\u2019s threat was meant mainly as a pressure tactic to try to force some diplomatic movement.\n\u201cI doubt he will resign,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/world/middleeast/12abbas.html", "title": "At Arafat Memorial, Abbas Pushes Independence Fight", "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER"}
{"date": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 Domesticated pigeons of this city, take note: Until Oct. 1, you are prohibited by government edict from flying over the center of China\u2019s capital.\nDo not take it personally, however. The government is preparing to observe the 60th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China with a parade that will make 76 trombones look like a child\u2019s plastic kazoo. And nothing \u2014 not unauthorized window-peeping, nor marchers\u2019 mental health, nor even the chance that pigeons might muck up displays of aerial might \u2014 is being left to chance.\nChina\u2019s government at times resembles an exasperated parent trying to rein in a pack of rebellious children. Its edicts are persistently flouted by censor-dodging Internet users, wayward local officials and rioting Uighurs.\nBut when it comes to the impending National Day celebration in Beijing, the government appears fully in control. When swarms of soldiers, throngs of tanks and flocks of floats roll past Tiananmen Square on Thursday, 10,000 police officers and security guards will monitor Beijing street corners and checkpoints for evidence of potential party-spoilers. As many as 800,000 volunteers have also been enlisted to help maintain security.\nKnife sales have been banned in at least some stores. Beijing\u2019s international airport will be closed Thursday for three hours. Along the parade route, the authorities have forbidden parade-watchers from opening windows or standing on balconies.\nThree journalists from the Japanese Kyodo news agency said that when they stood on a hotel balcony to cover a Sept. 18 parade rehearsal, the authorities stormed into the room and assaulted them. A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the journalists ignored explicit instructions not to report the event, apparently out of concern that details of the spectacle would be revealed.\nAnd it will be a spectacle. Nearly 5,000 of China\u2019s 2.3 million soldiers will march past the nation\u2019s leaders. They will be grouped partly according to height, with no variation of more than six centimeters, or about two and a half inches.\nNext will come rows of rumbling tanks and vehicles mounted with missiles, satellites and military equipment. More than 150 planes will fly in formation overhead, some trailing colored vapors.\nLiang Guanglie, the Chinese defense minister, has said the parade will demonstrate that China now has weaponry as sophisticated as developed nations have \u2014 and that the mat\u00e9riel is now manufactured in China.\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary achievement that speaks to the level of our military\u2019s modernization and the huge change in our country\u2019s technological strength,\u201d Mr. Liang said in remarks posted on his ministry\u2019s Web site.\nAnother senior military commander said intercontinental missiles capable of bearing nuclear warheads would be \u201cremarkable symbols\u201d of China\u2019s military might.\nThe Olympics that dazzled spectators last year showed China\u2019s knack for meticulous preparation. Participants in the Thursday parade have engaged in similarly intense drills for months, according to reports in the Chinese news media.\nSoldiers have practiced endless hours to hold their rifles at precisely the same level. Photos show their instructors holding threads as rifle guides, or sticking needles in soldiers\u2019 shirt collars, pointed at their necks, to correct poor posture.\nThey have trained to stand motionless for a solid hour, to refrain from swaying during the second hour and not to collapse after three hours, reported Xinhua, the state-run news agency.\nThey have been schooled in shouting phrases in perfect unison: \u201cServe the people!\u201d and \u201cHello, senior leader!\u201d They are also expected not to blink for 40 seconds at a time.\nMental-health professionals have been called in to help those whose performance is not up to snuff. As of Sept. 12, 1,300 soldiers had received counseling, Xinhua reported.\nTo limit the risk of a security lapse, cities and provinces outside Beijing have been told to cancel plans for parades or mass gatherings on Oct. 1.\nForeign tourists have been banned from Tibet, the site of violent protests last year, until Oct. 8, according to media reports.\nChinese news media have reported that the government has limited parade participants in Beijing\u2019s celebration to 187,000 \u2014 at least 300,000 fewer than in the last decennial celebration.\nPerformers have been carefully screened. Even the workers who are decorating the city with tens of millions of flowerpots had to undergo \u201cpolitical inspection,\u201d according to news reports.\nGiven all that, the grounding of tens of thousands of pigeons since mid-September \u2014 to avert any interference with practice for the military flyovers \u2014 may seem like a minor issue. Flying kites and model airplanes in Beijing has also been temporarily banned, to the distress of kite enthusiasts.\n\u201cOriginally, they were all very excited about the holiday,\u201d said Ming Ming, manager of the Sijimantian Kites Cultural Exchange Center, which sells kites and organizes competitions. \u201cNow, they are stuck at home. People are feeling a little annoyed.\u201d\nHe is not sure what they will do instead. \u201cMost of the people who are interested in kites aren\u2019t really interested in much else,\u201d he said.\nThe pigeons\u2019 captivity will be temporarily broken on Thursday: 60,000 are to be released simultaneously as part of the celebration. Then it is back to their coops for another week.\nDong Jingbei, president of the Dongcheng District Carrier Pigeon Association, said he understood China\u2019s desire for flawless festivities. But he wondered what shape the pigeons would be in.\n\u201cThis is totally unfair,\u201d Mr. Dong said. \u201cThis is like locking up an athlete in a tiny little room. When they finally let them out on Oct. 1 at Tiananmen, they won\u2019t even know which way is north!\u201d\nMr. Dong is doing his best to soothe angry pigeon owners in the association. \u201cWe\u2019re a government entity,\u201d he said to a reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we are going to complain to you, right? I\u2019m trying to work on their mentalities, but they are definitely annoyed.\u201d\nStill, he said, they understood that for a flawless parade day, no detail could be overlooked. Even the pigeons were undergoing security checks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of stuff you have in New York,\u201d Mr. Dong said. \u201cBut people could strap all sorts of minibombs to pigeon legs.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/world/asia/29beijing.html", "title": "No Detail Is Overlooked as China Prepares to Celebrate", "author": "SHARON LaFRANIERE"}

{"date": "Thu, 15 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 A wave of attacks against top security installations over the last several days demonstrated that the Taliban, Al Qaeda and militant groups once nurtured by the government are tightening an alliance aimed at bringing down the Pakistani state, government officials and analysts said.\nMore than 30 people were killed Thursday in Lahore, the second largest city in Pakistan, as three teams of militants assaulted two police training centers and a federal investigations building. The dead included 19 police officers and at least 11 militants, police officials said.\nNine others were killed in two attacks at a police station in Kohat, in the northwest, and a residential complex in Peshawar, capital of North-West Frontier Province.\nThe assaults in Lahore, coming after a 20-hour siege at the army headquarters in Rawalpindi last weekend, showed the deepening reach of the militant network, as well as its rising sophistication and inside knowledge of the security forces, officials and analysts said.\nThe umbrella group for the Pakistani Taliban, Tehrik-e-Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attacks in Lahore, the independent television news channel Geo reported on its Web site.\nBut the style of the attacks also revealed the closer ties between the Taliban and Al Qaeda and what are known as jihadi groups, which operate out of southern Punjab, the country\u2019s largest province, analysts said. The cooperation has made the militant threat to Pakistan more potent and insidious than ever, they said.\nThe government has tolerated the Punjabi groups, including Jaish-e-Muhammad and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, for years, and many Pakistanis consider them allies in just causes, including fighting India, the United States and Shiite Muslims. But they have become entwined with the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and have increasingly turned on the state.\nThe alliance has now stepped up attacks as the military prepares an assault on the Taliban stronghold of South Waziristan, where senior members of the Punjabi groups also find sanctuary and support.\n\u201cThese are all Punjabi groups with a link to South Waziristan,\u201d Aftab Ahmed Sherpao, a former interior minister, said, explaining the recent attacks.\nIn a rare acknowledgment of the lethal combination of forces, Interior Minister Rehman Malik said that a \u201csyndicate\u201d of militant groups wanted to see \u201cPakistan as a failed state.\u201d\n\u201cThe banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, Jaish-e-Muhammad, Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi are operating jointly in Pakistan,\u201d Mr. Malik told journalists, pledging a more effective counterstrategy.\nIn Washington, senior intelligence officials said the multiple coordinated attacks were a characteristic of operations influenced by Al Qaeda. But the officials said they were still sifting through intelligence reports to determine whether the attacks indeed marked an attempt by Al Qaeda to assert more influence over the Pakistani Taliban\u2019s operations.\nThey said the assaults also might have been orchestrated by the Taliban to avenge the death of Baitullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban leader, and send a stark message that the insurgents could still carry out daring attacks without him.\nThe fresh violence highlights the expanding challenges as the Obama administration tries to bolster Pakistan\u2019s civilian government and encourage the military to press its campaign against the Taliban.\nOn Thursday, President Obama signed a civilian aid package for Pakistan of $7.5 billion over five years. The package has prompted friction over conditions for the aid \u2014 like greater civilian oversight of the military and demands that Pakistan drop support for militant groups \u2014 which army officers and politicians considered infringements on Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty.\nThe White House issued a statement on Thursday noting the shared interests of the countries. However, in a sign of scant sympathy for the unappreciative reaction to the money, there was no signing ceremony.\nThe rise in more penetrating terrorist attacks may now add its own pressure on the Pakistani government to crack down on the Punjabi militants. It is time for the government to come out in public and explain the nature of the enemy, said Khalid Aziz, a former chief secretary of North-West Frontier Province.\n\u201cThe national narrative in support of jihad has confused the Pakistani mind,\u201d Mr. Aziz said. \u201cAll along we\u2019ve been saying these people are trying to fight a war of Islam, but there is a need for transforming the national narrative.\u201d\nThe jihadi groups were formally banned by the former president, Pervez Musharraf, after the Sept. 11 attacks, when Pakistan joined the United States in the campaign against terrorism.\nBut the groups have entrenched domestic and political constituencies, as well as shadowy ties to former military officials and their families, analysts said. Even since the ban, they have been allowed to operate in Punjab, often in the open.\nPunjab is the major recruiting center for the Pakistani Army and it hosts more army divisions than any other province. Yet \u201cthese groups proliferate and operate with impunity, literally under the nose of Pakistan\u2019s army,\u201d said Christine Fair, assistant professor at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.\nA large congregation of jihadi groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, met six months ago in Rawalpindi, the city where the army headquarters was attacked last Saturday, said Mr. Sherpao, the former interior minister.\nThe nature of the Lahore attacks drove home the point that the \u201cwar has come to Punjab,\u201d and that the government can no longer hide the alliance between the Taliban in South Waziristan and the forces in Southern Punjab, said Zaffar Abbas, a prominent journalist at the English-language newspaper Dawn.\nUntil the people are told the real situation, the government will never win the support of the people \u201cto fight this bloody war,\u201d Mr. Abbas said.\nIn fact, many Pakistanis do not see the jihadi groups as the enemy, said Farrukh Saleem, the executive director for the Center for Research and Security Studies in Islamabad. \u201cThey feel America is in the region and the Pakistani Army is fighting for an American army and the jihadis have a right to retaliate,\u201d he said.\nThe senior personnel in the security forces seem to understand the gravity of the militants\u2019 strength and the durability of their network, Mr. Saleem said. But they cannot bring themselves to say publicly that those whom they created are coming back to bite them, he said.\nThe ringleader of the assault on the army headquarters on Saturday, identified as Muhammad Aqeel, was a member of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, according to the military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas. Mr. Aqeel, who was captured alive, is also a former soldier in the Army Medical Corps, a background that appeared to have helped in planning the attack.\nTwo of the facilities attacked in and near Lahore on Thursday \u2014 the six-story building of the federal investigations agency, and a police training unit in the suburb of Manawan \u2014 were hit by militants in deadly assaults in 2008 and earlier this year.\nThe coordination of the attacks by three teams between 9 and 10 a.m. startled police officials as they scrambled to send commandos to each of the sites.\nThe raid on the headquarters of the Punjab elite police training school was seen as particularly insulting because its graduates, trained in counterterrorism techniques, are considered the pride of the province.\nFive militants scaled a wall of the elite training school, where more than 800 recruits had just started classes, said Maj. Gen. Shafqat Ahmed, the officer commanding security forces in Lahore.\nSix police officers were killed and seven were wounded in a gun battle that lasted more than two hours, police officials said. All five of the attackers were killed, they said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/16/world/asia/16pstan.html", "title": "Pakistan Attacks Show Tighter Militant Links", "author": "JANE PERLEZ"}
{"date": "Mon, 26 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Nine graduates of an influential Saudi rehabilitation program for former jihadists, including some who had been imprisoned at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, have been arrested for rejoining terrorist groups since the program started in 2004, Saudi officials said Monday.\nThe Saudi Interior Ministry acknowledged the arrests after it emerged late last week that two other graduates had joined the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda, raising questions about how the Saudis lost track of them. Both had been released from Guant\u00e1namo, in Cuba, in 2007, and one of the men is suspected of having helped plan a deadly attack in Yemen last year.\nThe statement on Monday about the arrests appeared to be an effort by the Saudi authorities to underline their vigilance, despite the lapses, in keeping track of former militants.\nHundreds of men have passed through the Saudi program, and it has been viewed as a model for similar efforts elsewhere. Late last year, Saudi officials said none of the program\u2019s graduates had returned to violence, but the statement about the arrests, which took place separately over the course of the past few years, appeared to contradict that.\nIt is not clear how many of the nine men had been at Guant\u00e1namo, said Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, a spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry. The rehabilitation program also includes people who were convicted of involvement in terrorist activities or groups inside Saudi Arabia.\n\u201cWhen they were released from the program they were O.K., but in one way or another they were recruited again\u201d by terrorist groups, General Turki said. The program, which includes religious re-education, therapy and assistance with reintegrating the former jihadists into their families and jobs, is more comprehensive than earlier, similar efforts in Yemen and Egypt, and appears over all to have been more successful.\nIf doubts are raised about the Saudi program, they could complicate President Obama\u2019s plan to close the Guant\u00e1namo detention center within a year, as required by one of his first executive orders after taking office last week. Almost half of the remaining prisoners there are Yemeni, and their return home depends in part on Yemen\u2019s creation of a rehabilitation program, paid for partly by the United States, that is modeled on the Saudi one.\nPentagon officials have said that 61 of the more than 525 Guant\u00e1namo detainees who have been released have returned to terrorism. That claim has generated some skepticism, and the Pentagon is expected to declassify portions of a report on the subject in the coming days.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/world/middleeast/27saudi.html", "title": "9 Alumni of Saudi Program for Ex-Jihadists Are Arrested", "author": "ROBERT F.

Then the president was shot dead, the former prime minister was arrested and tortured, a presidential candidate was killed in his villa, and the former defense minister was ambushed and shot on the bridge outside town.\nDespite those chilling messages \u2014 reportedly carried out by men in military uniform \u2014 Sunday\u2019s election to replace the assassinated president, Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira, will go on.\nThere is jolly music and dancing in the decaying streets; earnest international observers crisscross Bissau, the capital; the remaining candidates hold buoyant rallies in preparation for the vote; and trucks packed with chanting supporters bounce up and down over the little city\u2019s deep potholes.\nUnderneath, though, there is anxiety and doubt here in Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony that is pitch-black at night because of a lack of electricity and that is so fragile it is being abandoned even by the drug traffickers, according to a United Nations expert.\nNo specific suspects or motives have been found for the political killings of the past four months. And few here are betting that the election will check a military that never stood down after winning this West African country\u2019s liberation struggle nearly four decades ago.\n\u201cThe election won\u2019t end the problems,\u201d said Cheik Malaine, a 26-year-old who works at a downtown stationery store, as rocking goumb\u00e9 music blared from the ruling party\u2019s building next door. \u201cThe problem is the army,\u201d he said, looking down.\nAntonio Armando, a teacher, said angrily: \u201cIt\u2019s not possible, to live in a state where there are killings all the time. We practically have no state.\u201d\nA leading political scientist, Flavien Fafali Koudawo, said, \u201cThe day after the election will be the same as the day before.\u201d Then he began laughing, explaining it as \u201cthe humor of desperation.\u201d\nThe state \u201cis in a phase of deliquescence,\u201d said a former justice minister, Carlos Vamain. \u201cThe state has been dismantled.\u201d\nSigns of the government\u2019s disarray are everywhere. The roof is still caved in at the army building where the military chief of staff, Gen. Batista Tagme Na Waie, was killed in an explosion in March. He was the third officer to be killed in that post since 2000.\nThe windows are still blown out at the roofless presidential palace, abandoned since its destruction in the civil war of 10 years ago. Papaya trees grow from the ruins of buildings downtown destroyed during the war.\nThe grim indicators pile up, one after another. Potholes two feet deep pockmark central streets. A civil servant in a white shirt, approaching a newcomer, said he had not been paid for two months and begged for money to buy rice. Small, ragged boys scale mounds of garbage at the edge of town, searching for bits of copper and iron.\nThe life expectancy here, 46 years, is at the low end of the scale in Africa; per capita income is $180, and the mortality rate for children under 5 is one out of five.\n\u201cLife is too difficult here,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Mendes, 30, an accounting student who has family members in the civil service. \u201cYou work for two months, the government pays you for one.\u201d\nAt the heart of it all is this fact: No president elected since multiparty rule was restored in 1994 has completed his five-year term, because of military interventions. One global research organization, the International Crisis Group, said that if the military here did not get its way through lobbying, \u201cit proceeds to direct intimidation and violence, including beatings and even murder.\u201d\nBy some measures the military consumes 25 percent of the budget in Guinea-Bissau, a country that ranks ninth from the bottom in the United Nations Human Development Index.\nIn this uncertain atmosphere, even the one economic domain where Guinea-Bissau seemed to have a future, albeit a shady one \u2014 as a leading way station for Latin American drugs bound for Europe \u2014 is threatened.\n\u201cAlready in September the drug traffickers had started moving out of Guinea-Bissau,\u201d said Antonio L. Mazzitelli of the United Nations\u2019 Office on Drugs and Crime in Dakar, Senegal, noting that there had been no important drug seizures since October. The drug traffickers, he said, \u201cneed a certain stability.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need a failed state,\u201d Mr. Mazzitelli added. \u201cThey need a weak state.\u201d\nThe threat of violence from the army haunts everyday life. Dingama Aiamate, a worker at the port, said, \u201cPeople are afraid to speak, because if you speak, maybe they\u2019ll come get you at night, and you never know what is going to happen.\u201d\nThat fear has led political candidates and other prominent figures here to tiptoe around the question of holding the military accountable in the recent killings. The Interior Ministry said the army was merely putting down a coup plot in the case of the two most recent killings. Soldiers shot President Vieira in March.\nInside and outside the country, analysts insist that the only hope is to get rid of the army, find pensions for the soldiers and send them home.\nBut the leading candidate in Sunday\u2019s election, Malam Bacai Sanh\u00e1, a veteran of the governing party, said all of the country\u2019s public administration needed to be reformed, not just the military.\nIn an interview at his home here, in a break from crisscrossing the verdant countryside, Mr. Sanh\u00e1 refused to single out the army. After all, he said, soldiers make up only a quarter or so of the 25,000 federal employees.\nSimilarly, the prime minister, Carlos Gomes Jr. also of the governing party, known by its abbreviation, P.A.I.G.C., sidestepped questions about how and why some of the leading political figures had recently been killed.\nMr. Sanh\u00e1\u2019s chief rival, former President Kumba Yala, wears a red tasseled cap that emphasizes his ties to the Balanta ethnic group, and he is accused of exploiting divisions for electoral advantage. The Balanta are particularly strong in the military, and his supporters blame the P.A.I.G.C. for the recent killings, talking darkly of settling scores.\nBut whatever the outcome of the vote here, it is nearly certain not to settle this small country\u2019s crushing problems, in spite of the frenzy in the streets and the jaunty, blaring music everywhere.\n\u201cWe have the genius of make-believe here, and of not seeing things,\u201d Dr. Koudawo said, laughing again. \u201cThere is a culture of repression here.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/world/africa/28guinea.html", "title": "Nation in Disarray Holds Few Hopes for Vote", "author": "ADAM NOSSITER"}
{"date": "Fri, 23 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 International pressure is mounting on Sri Lanka\u2019s government to investigate atrocities that may have been committed during the final stages of its war with the Tamil Tiger insurgency as two new reports from the European Union and the State Department detailing alleged human rights abuses were released this week.\nThe reports come as Sri Lanka also faces intensifying criticism for its decision to keep more than 250,000 Tamils who were displaced by the fighting in closed camps that critics have likened to internment camps. The government says it plans to allow 80 percent of these people to return to their homes by the end of January, but insists that it must first weed out any remaining Tamil Tiger rebels hiding among them.\nThe European Union report could lead to the withdrawal of trade concessions worth tens of millions of dollars to Sri Lankan garment and fisheries industries. It represents the first threat of a serious sanction against the Sri Lankan government as a result of its conduct of the war.\nEconomists and business officials said the loss of the trade concessions, known as GSP-plus, could be a serious blow to an ailing Sri Lankan economy. The country\u2019s garment industry will probably bear the brunt of the impact because as much as 60 percent of the country\u2019s apparel exports go to the European Union.\nTariffs on some products could go to between 5 percent and 18 percent, from zero or near zero, said E. M. Wijetilleke, the secretary general and chief executive of the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka. Such increases could sink smaller companies that cannot cut costs to match bigger and lower-cost producers in China and India, he added.\n\u201cSome small-scale firms will not be able to survive and they will have to lay off the workers from their jobs,\u201d Mr. Wijetilleke said. \u201cThere will be a huge impact on the economy.\u201d\nThe garment industry in Sri Lanka employs about 270,000 workers directly and an additional 50,000 indirectly, according to estimates by Oxford Analytica, a research firm.\nThe State Department report, which was released Thursday, was largely a catalog of mostly unverified abuses by Sri Lankan forces and the Tamil Tigers based on reports from the American Embassy in Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial capital.\nBecause of limited access to the war zone by independent aid groups, human rights investigators and journalists, the report does not draw conclusions but urges Sri Lanka to investigate the allegations.\nAsked why the report did not take a tougher line, a State Department spokesman, Ian C. Kelly, defended the conclusions at a briefing with reporters this week.\nHe said the Obama administration was calling on the Sri Lankan government to open the closed areas to international scrutiny, to investigate the allegations and to bring to justice anyone responsible for atrocities.\nSo far, the Sri Lankan government has proved adept at eluding international scrutiny and seemingly indifferent to even the harshest criticism of the Western countries on human rights issues.\nIt maneuvered its allies on the United Nations Human Rights Council to transform a stern demand for an international war crimes inquiry into a resolution celebrating its triumph over the Tigers. Efforts by Western countries to stall a $2.6 billion loan to Sri Lanka from the International Monetary Fund also failed.\nInternational efforts to press Sri Lanka to release Tamil civilians from army-run camps in the country\u2019s north have borne little fruit. More than halfway to the government\u2019s self-imposed deadline to let almost all of the displaced people return to their homes, fewer than 10 percent have been allowed to leave, according to the United Nations, human rights organizations and aid groups. And some who have left the camps have been settled in other camps rather than being sent home, according to Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch.\n\u201cI think it is fair to say now they never intended to keep their commitment to return the displaced because they have consistently reneged on their promises,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cTheir promises are not to the international community, they are to the people in the camps.\u201d\nSri Lankan officials rejected this, saying the government had begun relocating 41,685 people from the camps to their homes in what was the battle zone. They denied that the Tamil civilians were being held prisoner.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/world/asia/24lanka.html", "title": "Reports Press Sri Lanka on Possible War Atrocities", "author": "LYDIA POLGREEN and VIKAS BAJAJ"}

{"date": "Sun, 04 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Gen. David H. Petraeus, the face of the Iraq troop surge and a favorite of former President George W. Bush, spoke up or was called upon by President Obama \u201cseveral times\u201d during the big Afghanistan strategy session in the Situation Room last week, one participant says, and will be back for two more meetings this week.\nBut the general\u2019s closest associates say that underneath the surface of good relations, the celebrity commander faces a new reality in Mr. Obama\u2019s White House: He is still at the table, but in a very different seat.\nNo longer does the man who oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have one of the biggest voices at National Security Council meetings, as he did when Mr. Bush gave him 20 minutes during hourlong weekly sessions to present his views in live video feeds from Baghdad. No longer is the general, with the Capitol Hill contacts and web of e-mail relationships throughout Washington\u2019s journalism establishment, testifying in media explosions before Congress, as he did in September 2007, when he gave 34 interviews in three days.\nThe change has fueled speculation in Washington about whether General Petraeus might seek the presidency in 2012. His advisers say that it is absurd \u2014 but in immediate policy terms, it means there is one less visible advocate for the military in the administration\u2019s debate over whether to send up to 40,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.\nGeneral Petraeus\u2019s aides now privately call him \u201cDave the Dull,\u201d and say he has largely muzzled himself from the fierce public debate about the war to avoid antagonizing the White House, which does not want pressure from military superstars and is wary of the general\u2019s ambitions in particular.\nThe general\u2019s aides requested anonymity to talk more candidly about his relationship with the White House.\n\u201cGeneral Petraeus has not hinted to anyone that he is interested in political life, and in fact has said on many occasions that he\u2019s not,\u201d said Peter Mansoor, a retired Army colonel and professor of military history at Ohio State University who was the executive officer to General Petraeus when he was the top American commander in Iraq.\n\u201cIt is other people who are looking at his popularity and saying that he would be a good presidential candidate, and I think rightly that makes the administration a little suspicious of him.\u201d\nGeneral Petraeus\u2019s advisers say he has stepped back in part because Mr. Obama has handpicked his own public face for the war in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who last week gave an interview to CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d met with Mr. Obama on Air Force One and used a speech in London to reject calls for scaling back the war effort.\nIf anything, General McChrystal\u2019s public comments may prove that General Petraeus might be prudent to take a back seat during the debate. On Sunday, when CNN\u2019s John King asked Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser, if it was appropriate for a man in uniform to appear to campaign so openly for more troops, General Jones replied, \u201cIdeally, it\u2019s better for military advice to come up through the chain of command.\u201d\nHow much General Petraeus\u2019s muted voice will affect Mr. Obama\u2019s decision on the war is unclear, but people close to him say that stifling himself in public could give him greater credibility to influence the debate from within. Others say that his biggest influence may simply be as part of a team of military advisers, including General McChrystal and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nThe men are united in what they see as the need to build up the American effort in Afghanistan, although General Petraeus, who works closely with General McChrystal, said last week that he had not yet endorsed General McChrystal\u2019s request for more troops.\nTogether the three are likely to be aligned against Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., as well as other administration officials who want to scale back the effort. In that situation, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who has worried about a big American presence in Afghanistan but left the door open to more troops, could be the most influential vote.\nWhat is clear is that General Petraeus\u2019s relationship with Mr. Obama is nothing like his bond with Mr. Bush, who went mountain biking with the general in Washington last fall, or with Mr. Obama\u2019s opponent in the 2008 presidential campaign, Senator John McCain of Arizona, whose aides briefly floated the general\u2019s name last year as a possible running mate.\nBy then the general had been talked about as a potential presidential candidate himself, which still worries some political aides at the White House.\nBut not Mr. Obama, at least according to one of his top advisers. \u201cThe president\u2019s not thinking that way, and the vice president\u2019s not thinking that way,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff. \u201cThe president values his insights in helping to turn around an eight-year-old war that has been neglected.\u201d\nGeneral Petraeus\u2019s advisers say that to preserve a sense of military impartiality, he has not voted since at least 2003, and that he is not sure if he is still registered in New Hampshire, where he and his wife own property. The general has been described as a Republican, including in a lengthy profile in The New Yorker magazine last year. But a senior military official close to him said last week that he could not confirm the general\u2019s political party.\nIn the meantime, General Petraeus travels frequently from his home in Tampa to Washington, where he met last week with the Afghan foreign minister. He also had dinner with Richard C. Holbrooke, the administration\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The general also makes calls on Capitol Hill.\n\u201cHe understands the Congress better than any military commander I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who said that General Petraeus had the nationwide influence to serve as a spokesman for the administration\u2019s policy on the Afghan war.\nBut until the president makes a decision, and determines if he wants to deploy General Petraeus to help sell it, the commander is keeping his head down. \u201cHe knows how to make his way through minefields like this,\u201d said Jack Keane, the former vice chief of staff of the Army.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/world/05military.html", "title": "Voice of Bush\u2019s Favored General Is Now Harder to Hear", "author": "ELISABETH BUMILLER"}
{"date": "Tue, 05 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BERLIN \u2014 Germany is renowned for fighting inflation, but the battle extends beyond money and into the realm of names. In a split decision on Tuesday, the German Constitutional Court upheld a ban on married people combining already-hyphenated names, forbidding last names of three parts or more.\nIt was not the first time the court was forced to weigh in on the subject of names, which are regulated start to finish, fore to family, here in Germany. This time, it was a Munich couple who decided to challenge the constitutionality of a 1993 rule limiting the names of married people to a single hyphen and two last names.\nFrieda Rosemarie Thalheim, a Munich dentist, wanted to take the last name of her husband, Hans Peter Kunz-Hallstein, to become Frieda Rosemarie Thalheim-Kunz-Hallstein. The case brought Germany\u2019s minister of justice before the court in Karlsruhe for oral arguments in February to defend the ban on what the Germans call \u201cchain names.\u201d\nBy a vote of five to three, the court refused to budge, ruling that ballooning names \u201cwould quickly lose the effectiveness of their identifying purpose,\u201d and declined to overturn the law on the grounds that it infringed on personal expression.\nIn a telephone interview, the couple\u2019s lawyer, R\u00fcdiger Zuck, said his clients had no comment on the ruling, but added, with what sounded distinctly like a note of resignation, \u201cThe Germans are old-fashioned.\u201d\nGermany takes a highly regimented approach to naming. Children\u2019s names must be approved by local authorities, and there is a reference work, the International Handbook of Forenames, to guide them. J\u00fcrgen Udolph, a University of Leipzig professor and head of the information center there that provides certificates of approval for names that have not yet made the official list, said that \u201cthe state has a responsibility to protect people from idiotic forenames.\u201d\nThat responsibility is often tested in court. In 2003, an appellate court ruled that a boy could not be named \u201cAnderson,\u201d because it was a last name in Germany. And the Constitutional Court ruled in 2004 to limit the number of forenames a child could have, capping at five the number a mother could give her son, to whom she had tried to bequeath the 12-part \u201cChenekwahow Tecumseh Migiskau Kioma Ernesto Inti Prithibi Pathar Chajara Majim Henriko Alessandro,\u201d to protect the child.\nGermany\u2019s economy minister found professional success despite bearing the lengthy name Karl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg, a name as aristocratic as it is long. Although, when he was appointed to the job, a practical joker sneaked the name \u201cWilhelm\u201d into his Wikipedia entry for good measure, an error that promptly spread to numerous media reports, including one on the front page of Bild, the country\u2019s largest newspaper.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/world/europe/06germany.html", "title": "High Court in Germany Pops Names That Balloon", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH"}

Dozens of them have staged weekly protests against IntellecPro lawyers who are pursuing the trademark case, mocking them as bourgeois puppets of foreigners. The vendors confronted witnesses who provided evidence of trademark violations and filed a countersuit asserting that only the government can shutter a business.\nA few characters scrawled in pencil on the wall outside IntellecPro\u2019s office sums up the vendors\u2019 message: \u201cWe want to eat!\u201d\nThe skirmish between the crafty but mostly uneducated hawkers and five of the world\u2019s best known producers of designer goods is part of a much bigger fight over China\u2019s vast counterfeit industry. American movie, music and software companies alone estimate that Chinese pirated goods cost them more than $2 billion a year in sales.\nAny successful product is likely to be illegally copied in China, warns the Web site of the American Embassy here. China\u2019s government has pledged to crack down, and it faces increasing pressure to show progress. But some doubt much will change until China graduates from manufacturing goods to designing them, and has more to lose than gain.\nThe Silk Street Market case suggests that change is slow and painful.\nIt has been four years since Burberry, Gucci, Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada first sued the market\u2019s operator, the Beijing Silk Street Company, and individual vendors for trademark violations. Only now has the legal pressure produced tangible results.\nAs part of a court-mediated agreement, the market\u2019s managers agreed to punish offending vendors, shutting down six to eight at a time for up to a week. George Wang, the market\u2019s general manager, said the manufacturers threatened to renew their suit if sales of counterfeits were not curtailed in six months.\nIn response, dozens of vendors descended on IntellecPro\u2019s office on Feb. 4, occupying the reception area for hours while the police tried to mediate, said Ms. Zhao, the legal consultant. The next day, she said, they stormed past the receptionist, banged on the walls and swore at the staff. The firm\u2019s senior partner, Hu Qi, was afraid to go home and slept in a hotel for three nights.\nLast Monday, more than 50 vendors showed up for the sixth protest. They waved signs and chanted slogans outside the firm\u2019s building while IntellecPro lawyers, with 12 hired guards on hand, had their lunch delivered.\n\u201cWe are trying to run businesses here,\u201d said one 37-year-old vendor in a red coat, a fake Dolce & Gabbana handbag on her arm. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any proof.\u201d She refused to give her name, saying she already faced enough scrutiny.\nAsked about her handbag, she insisted: \u201cWe don\u2019t read English. We don\u2019t know what the letters mean. We just think it is pretty.\u201d\nAnother vendor, 24, who gave her last name as He, said: \u201cWe want to be compensated for our losses. And we want a public apology.\u201d\nMr. Wang, the market\u2019s amiable, 43-year-old manager, said he was \u201cstuck in a terrible position.\u201d\n\u201cThe five brands are saying, \u2018You are not doing a good enough job in protecting our intellectual property rights,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd the vendors are saying, \u2018You are going overboard in protecting intellectual property rights.\u2019 But hey, what can we do? We would rather be known in the world as going overboard than for not.\u201d\nThere is little risk of that now. Tourist guidebooks call the Silk Street Market, a seven-story glass box near Beijing\u2019s diplomatic quarter, one of China\u2019s most popular spots to buy cheap, good-quality imitations. With some 1,200 stalls, it attracts 15 million shoppers a year, two-thirds of them foreigners, Mr. Wang said.\nIn the noisy basement, hawkers of leather goods buttonhole passing foreigners, cajoling until all hope of a sale is lost. They chat easily in broken English and can assess a copy\u2019s quality in seconds; the best, rated \u201csuper-A,\u201d are almost indistinguishable from genuine products.\nTheir shelves bulge with fake handbags bearing the designs and tags of Coach, Dolce & Gabbana, Chlo\u00e9 and other famous companies, which, Mr. Wang said, \u201chave not come to us with a complaint.\u201d\nFake Gucci and Louis Vuitton bags are still offered, but are hidden inside cupboards; buyers are invited to seal the transactions outside the building. \u201cThere is too much pressure on right now,\u201d whispered one vendor, a few yards from a stall shrouded in a gray curtain.\nXu Shengzhong, the vendors\u2019 lawyer, tries to portray his clients as too ignorant to distinguish fake goods from real or to recognize brand names. \u201cThey have no idea this says Louis Vuitton,\u201d he said, tapping a brown wallet with the brand\u2019s distinctive logo.\nMore potent than such equivocations, though, may be the threat of social unrest. The police, saying their first priority is to maintain order, organized a meeting between some vendors and Mr. Hu, IntellecPro\u2019s senior partner, according to the firm\u2019s spokeswoman. It went poorly.\nThe merchants lectured Mr. Hu on the need for intellectuals like him to respect workers, while Mr. Hu tried to defend his patriotism, according to an audio CD made from one vendor\u2019s clandestine cellphone recording.\n\u201cThese ordinary people work for decades, to their deaths!\u201d one vendor said. \u201cHow can you say you are patriotic?\u201d\nMr. Wang said that while he sympathized with the vendors, \u201cthe Silk Market must fundamentally change\u201d and shift its focus from counterfeit goods to genuine pearls, silks, homegrown brands and tailoring services.\nLast year, the market began its own line of products, warning counterfeiters to stay clear.\nMr. Wang said he hoped that shoppers changed their habits, too. At present, \u201cthey want the knockoffs,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cYou can see it in their eyes. That is the brutal reality.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/world/asia/02piracy.html", "title": "Facing Counterfeiting Crackdown, Beijing Vendors Fight Back", "author": "SHARON LaFRANIERE"}
{"date": "Mon, 10 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 The head of Britain\u2019s Secret Intelligence Service has joined other senior British government officials in the defense of Britain\u2019s counterterrorism policies, rejecting accusations that his agency has colluded in the torture of terrorist suspects being interrogated abroad.\nIn an interview broadcast by the BBC on Monday, the official, Sir John Scarlett, said his officers were \u201cas committed to the values and the human rights values of liberal democracy as anybody else.\u201d He said there had been \u201cno torture and no complicity in torture\u201d by Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies, as several former detainees at the United States camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, have alleged.\nSir John\u2019s remarks were part of what the BBC described as the first broadcast interview given by a serving head of Britain\u2019s overseas intelligence agency, which is also known as MI6. The interview was part of a radio series on the history of the service. In November, shortly after the service\u2019s 100th anniversary, the MI6 chief will retire and be succeeded by Sir John Sawers, currently Britain\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations.\nThe interview appeared to be part of a wider effort by the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown to influence opinion in Britain at a time when pressure has been growing for a judicial inquiry into allegations that British officials from MI6 and its sister agency for domestic intelligence, MI5, knowingly assisted or allowed torture by agents of foreign governments.\nGovernment concern has focused on a lawsuit by Binyam Mohamed, a former Guant\u00e1namo detainee now living in Britain, where he gained residency status a year before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. His lawyers are fighting in British courts to win the publication of secret correspondence between British and American officials that the lawyers say will show that Britain knew, or had reason to know, that Mr. Mohamed was being tortured while Britain was cooperating with American agencies involved in his custody.\nUnder pressure from the Obama administration, which has warned that intelligence cooperation between the countries could be affected if the secret documents are released, the government in London has refused to make the documents public. In the past week, two parliamentary committees have joined the battle.\nLast week, the joint human rights committee of the House of Commons and the House of Lords said that there was a \u201cdisturbing number of credible allegations\u201d of British complicity in the torture of detainees held abroad, and urged the government to order a public inquiry. The Commons\u2019 Foreign Affairs Committee followed with a report saying that it, too, had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that British intelligence officers may have been involved, at least indirectly, in detainees\u2019 mistreatment.\nThe Ethiopian-born Mr. Mohamed, 31, was arrested at an airport in Karachi, Pakistan, in 2002 carrying a false British passport, and American officials have said that he trained at a camp in Afghanistan, run by Al Qaeda, for a plot aimed at detonating a \u201cdirty bomb\u201d in the United States. But charges against him were dropped in 2008 when prosecutors at Guant\u00e1namo acknowledged that evidence against him had been acquired, in part, during the interrogation of another detainee that involved use of the simulated-drowning technique known as waterboarding.\nAfter his return to Britain this year, Mr. Mohamed claimed he was tortured in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Morocco while in American custody, and when he was being transferred under the rendition program adopted by the Bush administration after the Sept. 11 attacks. He has said that questions put to him while he was being held in Pakistan and Morocco could only have been based on information provided by British intelligence agencies.\nMr. Mohamed said he was abused at Guant\u00e1namo as well, and has asked a federal court in Washington to preserve \u201cphotographic evidence\u201d that he says shows him being \u201csavagely beaten.\u201d American officials have denied any abuse.\nBritish officials have also denied his accusations and said the fact that an MI5 official, who met Mr. Mohamed while he was held in Pakistan, later visited Morocco three times while he was a prisoner there was unrelated to his case.\nBut even as it has stood its ground in rejecting the release of the secret British-American correspondence in the case, the government has adopted a parallel strategy of arguing that protecting Britain against terrorist attacks required \u201crealism\u201d in the country\u2019s intelligence exchanges with other governments.\nThe argument was put squarely in an article published over the weekend in The Sunday Telegraph in which two of the most senior ministers in the cabinet, Home Secretary Alan Johnson and Foreign Secretary David Miliband, argued that Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies had \u201chard choices\u201d to make in striking the balance between human rights and the country\u2019s security.\n\u201cWhen detainees are held by our police or armed forces we can be sure how they are treated, and whether our standards are met,\u201d they said. \u201cBy definition, we cannot have that same level of assurance when they are held by foreign governments, whose obligations and practices may differ from our own.\n\u201cYet intelligence from overseas is critical to our success in stopping terrorism,\u201d they continued. \u201cAll the most serious plots and attacks in the U.K. in this decade have had significant links abroad.\u201d\nThe theme was echoed in the BBC interview with Sir John.\n\u201cWe are an independent service working to our own laws \u2014 nobody\u2019s else\u2019s \u2014 and to our own values,\u201d he said, noting, however, that MI6 officers had to weigh their decisions carefully in dealing with foreign intelligence agencies. \u201cThey also have the responsibility to protect the country against terrorism, and these issues need to be debated and understood in that context.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/europe/11britain.html", "title": "Head of MI6 Denies Role of Agency in Torture", "author": "JOHN F.

{"date": "Wed, 20 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Leaders of the Taliban and other armed groups battling the Afghan government are talking to intermediaries about a potential peace agreement, with initial demands focused on a timetable for a withdrawal of American troops, according to Afghan leaders here and in Pakistan.\nThe talks, if not the withdrawal proposals, are being supported by the Afghan government. The Obama administration, which has publicly declared its desire to coax \u201cmoderate\u201d Taliban fighters away from armed struggle, says it is not involved in the discussions and will not be until the Taliban agree to lay down their arms. But nor is it trying to stop the talks, and Afghan officials believe they have tacit support from the Americans.\nThe discussions have so far produced no agreements, since the insurgents appear to be insisting that any deal include an American promise to pull out \u2014 at the very time that the Obama administration is sending more combat troops to help reverse the deteriorating situation on the battlefield. Indeed, with 20,000 additional troops on the way, American commanders seem determined to inflict greater pain on the Taliban first, to push them into negotiations and extract better terms. And most of the initial demands are nonstarters for the Americans in any case.\nEven so, the talks are significant because they suggest how a political settlement may be able to end the eight-year-old war, and how such negotiations may proceed. They also raise the prospect of potentially difficult decisions by President Hamid Karzai and President Obama, who may have to consider making deals with groups like the Taliban that are anathema to many Americans, and other leaders with brutal and bloody pasts. Some of the leaders in the current talks have been involved with Al Qaeda.\nWhile the talks have been under way for months, they have accelerated since Mr. Obama took office and have produced more specific demands, the Afghan intermediaries said.\nThe Taliban leaders, through their spokesman, and those of other armed groups publicly deny that they are involved in any negotiations. But several Afghans here and in Pakistan say they have been talking directly to the Taliban leadership group headed by Mullah Muhammad Omar, the movement\u2019s secretive founder. The council is based in the Pakistani city of Quetta.\nDiscussions have also been held with representatives of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a longtime warlord with a record of extreme brutality, and with Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose guerrilla army is based in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Mr. Haqqani\u2019s group is also known for its ruthlessness and for sending suicide bombers into Afghanistan.\n\u201cAmerica cannot win this war, and the Taliban cannot win this war,\u201d Mullah Abdul Salaam Zaeef, a former Taliban ambassador and one of the intermediaries, said in an interview. \u201cI have delivered this message to the Taliban.\u201d\nThe talks under way now appear to be directed not at individual bands of antigovernment insurgents \u2014 the strategy suggested by President Obama \u2014 but at the leaders of the large movements.\nAmerican officials insist they are not participating in any talks. \u201cThe U.S. would support such efforts only if Taliban are willing to abandon violence and lay down their arms, and accept Afghanistan\u2019s democratically elected government,\u201d said Ian Kelly, a State Department spokesman. Still, two of the principal intermediaries, Mr. Zaeef and Daoud Abedi, said they had held extensive discussions with American officials.\nA State Department memo described a single meeting with Mr. Abedi, but said it ended abruptly because American officials were not permitted to meet with representatives of Mr. Hekmatyar. There is no independent confirmation of Mr. Zaeef \u2019s claim to have met with Americans.\nAfghan officials said they welcomed the talks. \u201cThe government has kept all channels of communication open,\" said Homayun Hamidzada, a spokesman for Mr. Karzai. \u201cThis includes the Taliban and Hekmatyar.\u201d\nMr. Abedi, an Afghan-American businessman from California and a member of Mr. Hekmatyar\u2019s political party, the Islamic Party, said he conducted negotiations in March. Guerrillas loyal to Mr. Hekmatyar are battling the Americans in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan. His political party still has a wide following in the country.\nIn an interview, Mr. Abedi said he undertook the negotiations \u2014 with Mr. Hekmatyar and with the Taliban leaders \u2014 at the behest of the State Department, a claim that American officials deny. Mr. Abedi said he met several times with American officials in Washington before and after his trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan. He declined to say which American diplomats he met, saying, \u201cI am a Pashtun, and I swore on my honor that I would not reveal the names of the people I met with, so I cannot.\u201d\nMr. Abedi said he hammered out a common set of demands between the Taliban and Mr. Hekmatyar\u2019s group. The groups agreed to stop fighting if those conditions were met, Mr. Abedi said. The Taliban\u2019s demands seem incompatible with much of Mr. Obama\u2019s strategy, which is to substantially weaken the Taliban through a combination of military force and economic development.\nNor did the deal Mr. Abedi described mention either Osama bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahri, the two senior Qaeda leaders believed to be hiding in Pakistan under the protection of the Taliban or some other armed group.\nThe first demand was an immediate pullback of American and other foreign forces to their bases, followed by a cease-fire and a total withdrawal from the country over the next 18 months. Then the current government would be replaced by a transitional government made up of a range of Afghan leaders, including those of the Taliban and other insurgents. Americans and other foreign soldiers would be replaced with a peacekeeping force drawn from predominantly Muslim nations, with a guarantee from the insurgent groups that they would not attack such a force. Nationwide elections would follow after the Western forces left.\nAs for Mr. Hekmatyar, Mr. Abedi said that he maintained a \u201cdirect link\u201d with him, and that he was authorized to negotiate on his behalf. He did not meet with Afghan government officials.\nAfter the agreement between the Taliban and the Islamic Party was reached, Mr. Abedi said, the Taliban leaders added more conditions: an end to the drone attacks in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas, and the release of some Taliban prisoners.\nMr. Abedi said that when he returned to the United States with his proposal, he was greeted with enthusiasm by officials at the State Department. But he said they never called him back.\nMr. Hekmatyar earned a reputation as an especially brutal commander in the civil war that engulfed the country in the 1990s, in particular for the relentless bombardment of Kabul between 1994 and 1996 that killed an estimated 40,000 civilians during an attempt to capture the capital.\nIn 2002, after Mr. Hekmatyar resisted the American invasion, the Americans tried to kill him with a missile fired from a remotely piloted airplane. They missed.\nThe other main negotiation is led by Mr. Zaeef and Arsallah Rahmani, a former Taliban minister and now a member of the Afghan Parliament.\n\u201cWe are not talking to low-ranking people \u2014 we are talking to the leaders,\u201d Mr. Rahmani said in an interview. Mr. Zaeef was the Taliban\u2019s ambassador to Pakistan; he served nearly four years in American military prisons, including the one at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\nTheir plan would be for the guerrillas and the government to reconcile slowly, starting with the least contentious issues. One of the main low-level demands of the opposition leaders is that their names be removed from a so-called blacklist, contained in a resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council, which obliges governments to detain them. More difficult issues would follow.\n\u201cBlood begets blood, but talking begets peace,\u201d Mr. Rahmani said.\nMr. Zaeef said the public declarations of Mullah Omar, who usually vows to fight on, are not necessarily to be taken seriously.\n\u201cA policy can have many faces,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/asia/21kabul.html", "title": "U.S. Pullout a Condition in Afghan Peace Talks", "author": "DEXTER FILKINS"}
{"date": "Tue, 22 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PARIS \u2014 A Bulgarian diplomat, Irina Bokova, was elected Tuesday night as the new director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. She defeated the Egyptian culture minister, Farouk Hosny, by a vote of 31 to 27 in a fifth and final round of voting that has been marred by intense international politics.\nMs. Bokova, 57, Bulgaria\u2019s ambassador to France and Unesco, is the first woman and the first Eastern European to run the agency, which deals with culture, architectural protection, education, press freedom and many other issues.\nHer victory was a bitter defeat for Egypt and its president, Hosni Mubarak, who tried to line up the 30 votes of the Unesco executive board in advance to ensure a first-round victory in an initial field of nine candidates. But Mr. Hosny, 71, was accused of anti-Semitism and censorship in his 22 years as culture minister, and his lead slowly melted away as his opponents finally coalesced around Ms. Bokova.\nIn the fourth round of voting on Monday night, the candidates were tied, 29 to 29. Two countries changed their votes overnight in the secret balloting, but it was not clear which ones, since some countries had promised support to Egypt in the first round, but shifted in later rounds, diplomats said.\nOne person close to the proceedings said that Spain and Italy had shifted their votes after learning new information about what is alleged to have been Mr. Hosny\u2019s role, as an Egyptian diplomat, in protecting the perpetrators of a terrorist act involving an Italian cruise ship in 1985, but that could not be confirmed Tuesday night. The person spoke anonymously because of the delicacy of the matter.\nAccording to an account on Saturday on Elaph.com, an Arabic-language Web site, Mr. Hosny boasted of helping to organize the escape from Italy in 1985 of the hijackers of the cruise ship, the Achille Lauro. In that episode, a retired American Jewish tourist in a wheelchair was shot and pushed into the sea, horrifying much of the world.\nMr. Hosny was also on the defensive for a comment he made in the Egyptian Parliament last year. Accused of being too soft on Israel, he said that he would personally burn any Israeli book found in the Alexandria library, Egypt\u2019s most important. He was attacked early on by French intellectuals, some of them Jewish, like Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy, and by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel.\nMr. Wiesel, interviewed by telephone on Tuesday night from New York, said: \u201cThe vote is great for Unesco. It saved Unesco from moral disaster.\u201d\nMs. Bokova, a former foreign minister who has been Bulgaria\u2019s ambassador to France and Unesco since 2007, joined the Communist-era Foreign Ministry as the daughter of a government favorite who edited a state newspaper. But like Bulgaria, she has made the transition to a more democratic politics.\nTuesday night, after the vote, the Egyptian ambassador to Unesco made a point of approaching Ms. Bokova, hugging her and saying that \u201cwe are in this together,\u201d a gesture much appreciated within the executive board, diplomats said. Ms. Bokova raised his arm and repeated, \u201cWe\u2019re in this together.\u201d\nAfter the vote, speaking in French and in English, she told reporters that she intended to take all the best ideas of all the candidates and spoke warmly of Mr. Hosny.\nThe choice of Ms. Bokova is now subject to confirmation by the 193-member general conference of Unesco, which meets next month, but that vote is now considered a formality, especially after the friendly reaction of the Egyptian ambassador.\nMs. Bokova is a popular member of the Socialist Party, formerly Bulgaria\u2019s Communist party, now in opposition, and she studied at elite Moscow schools. She specialized in the United States and arms control and was foreign minister from November 1996 to February 1997. She speaks English, French, Spanish and Russian.\nThe election deeply divided Unesco, which has never before gone to a fifth round of voting. Several African countries said that Egypt had put intense pressure on them. The representatives of Madagascar, Nigeria, Pakistan and Lebanon were withdrawn from their jobs when they refused to vote for Mr. Hosny, said a Unesco diplomat who spoke anonymously according to protocol.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/world/23unesco.html", "title": "After Uproar, Unesco Rejects Egyptian", "author": "STEVEN ERLANGER"}
{"date": "Fri, 27 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JALALABAD, Afghanistan \u2014 The American-backed campaign to persuade legions of Taliban gunmen to stop fighting got under way here recently, in an ornate palace filled with Afghan tribal leaders and one very large former warlord leading the way.\n\u201cO.K., I want you guys to go out there and persuade the Taliban to sit down and talk,\u201d Gul Agha Shirzai, the governor of Nangarhar Province, told a group of 25 tribal leaders from four eastern provinces. In a previous incarnation, Mr. Shirzai was the American-picked governor of Kandahar Province after the Taliban fell in 2001.\n\u201cDo whatever you have to do,\u201d the rotund Mr. Shirzai told the assembled elders. \u201cI\u2019ll back you up.\u201d\nAfter about two hours of talking, Mr. Shirzai and the tribal elders rose, left for their respective provinces and promised to start turning the enemy.\nThe meeting is part of a battlefield push to lure local fighters and commanders away from the Taliban by offering them jobs in development projects that Afghan tribal leaders help select, paid by the American military and the Afghan government.\nBy enlisting the tribal leaders to help choose the development projects, the Americans also hope to help strengthen both the Afghan government and the Pashtun tribal networks.\nThese efforts are focusing on rank-and-file Taliban; while there are some efforts under way to negotiate with the leaders of the main insurgent groups, neither American nor Afghan officials have much faith that those talks will succeed soon.\nAfghanistan has a long history of fighters switching sides \u2014 sometimes more than once. Still, efforts so far to persuade large numbers of Taliban fighters to give up have been less than a complete success. To date, about 9,000 insurgents have turned in their weapons and agreed to abide by the Afghan Constitution, said Muhammad Akram Khapalwak, the chief administrator for the Peace and Reconciliation Commission in Kabul.\nBut in an impoverished country ruined by 30 years of war, tribal leaders said that many more insurgents would happily put down their guns if there was something more worthwhile to do.\n\u201cMost of the Taliban in my area are young men who need jobs,\u201d said Hajji Fazul Rahim, a leader of the Abdulrahimzai tribe, which spans three eastern provinces. \u201cWe just need to make them busy. If we give them work, we can weaken the Taliban.\u201d\nIn the Jalalabad program, tribal elders would reach out to Taliban commanders to press them to change sides. The commanders and their fighters then would be offered jobs created by local development programs.\nThe Pashtuns, who form the core of the Taliban, make up a largely tribal society, with families connected to one another by kinship and led by groups of elders. Over the years, the Pashtun tribes have been substantially weakened, with elders singled out by three groups: Taliban fighters, the rebels who fought the former Soviet Union and the soldiers of the former Soviet Union itself. The decimation of the tribes has left Afghan society largely atomized.\nAfghan and American officials hope that the plan to make peace with groups of Taliban fighters will complement an American-led effort to set up anti-Taliban militias in many parts of the country: the Pashtun tribes will help fight the Taliban, and they will make deals with the Taliban. And, by so doing, Afghan tribal society can be reinvigorated.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put pressure on the leaders, and at the same time peel away their young fighters,\u201d said an American military official in Kabul involved in the reconciliation effort. \u201cThis is not about handing bags of money to an insurgent.\u201d\nThe Afghan reconciliation plan is intended to duplicate the Awakening movement in Iraq, where Sunni tribal leaders, many of them insurgents, agreed to stop fighting and in many cases were paid to do so. The Awakening contributed to the remarkable decline in violence in Iraq.\nIn the autumn of 2001, during the opening phase of the American-led war in Afghanistan, dozens of warlords fighting for the Taliban agreed to defect to the American-backed rebels. As in Iraq, the defectors were often enticed by cash, sometimes handed out by American Army Special Forces officers.\nAt a ceremony earlier this month in Kabul, about 70 insurgents laid down their guns before the commissioners and agreed to accept the Afghan Constitution. Some of the men had fought for the Taliban, some for Hezb-i-Islami, another insurgent group. The fighters\u2019 motives ranged from disillusion to exhaustion.\n\u201cHow long should we fight the government? How many more years?\u201d said Molawi Fazullah, a Taliban lieutenant who surrendered with nine others. \u201cOur leaders misled us, and we destroyed our country.\u201d\nLike many fighters who gave up at the ceremony, he shrouded his face with a scarf and sunglasses, for fear of being identified by his erstwhile comrades.\nThe Americans say they have no plans to give cash to local Taliban commanders. They say they would rather give them jobs.\nIn a defense appropriations bill recently approved by Congress, lawmakers set aside $1.3 billion for a program known by its acronym, CERP, a discretionary fund for American officers. Ordinarily, CERP money is used for development projects, but the language in the bill says officers can use the money to support the \u201creintegration into Afghan society\u201d of those who have given up fighting.\nFor all the efforts under way to entice Taliban fighters to change sides, there will always be the old-fashioned approach: deadly force. American commanders also want to squeeze them; such is the rationale behind Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal\u2019s request for tens of thousands of additional American troops.\nIndeed, sometimes force alone does the trick. On Oct. 9, American Special Forces soldiers killed Ghulam Yahia, an insurgent commander believed responsible for, among other things, sending several suicide bombers into the western city of Herat. Mr. Yahia had changed sides himself in the past: earlier in the decade, he was Herat\u2019s mayor.\nWhen the Americans killed Mr. Yahia, in a mountain village called Bedak, 120 of his fighters defected to the Afghan government. Others went into hiding. Abdul Wahab, a former lieutenant of Mr. Yahia\u2019s who led the defectors, said that the Afghan government had so far done nothing to protect them or offer them jobs. But he said he was glad he had made the jump anyway.\n\u201cWe are tired of war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it anymore.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/world/asia/28militias.html", "title": "Afghans Offer Jobs to Taliban Rank and File if They Defect", "author": "DEXTER FILKINS"}
{"date": "Wed, 15 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "HILLA, Iraq \u2014 Iraq\u2019s provincial elections in January promised something still rare here: hope for the democratic political process. \u201cThe best election in the Middle East,\u201d a party leader here in Babil Province declared.\nWhat has happened since then is something far more familiar to Iraqis: threats, intrigue, back-room deal-making, protests, political paralysis and, increasingly, popular discontent.\nTwo and a half months after the elections, the 14 provinces that voted have only now begun forming provincial councils, the equivalent of state legislatures in the United States. Five provinces, including Babil, Najaf and Basra, still have no functioning governments, despite a deadline that passed last week, as party leaders squabble over the selection of governors, council chairmen and their deputies.\nElections that were supposed to strengthen Iraq\u2019s democracy, unite its ethnic and sectarian factions, and begin to improve sorely needed basic services \u2014 water, electricity, roads \u2014 have instead exposed the fault lines that still threaten the country\u2019s stability.\nThe disarray reflects the anxious jockeying before national elections expected this winter, contests that could inflame tensions and disrupt President Obama\u2019s plan to withdraw American combat forces in 2010.\n\u201cWe have to be honest with the people,\u201d said Nehme al-Bekari, the lawmaker here in Babil who called the election the region\u2019s best. \u201cOur experiment is not mature enough. We are still students in the school of democracy.\u201d\nMr. Bekari belongs to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\u2019s Dawa Party, which emerged as the strongest force in Iraqi politics after a campaign in which its candidates pledged to promote security and rule of law.\nSince the elections, however, Mr. Maliki\u2019s supporters have had to cobble together coalitions with the other Shiite parties that dominate the south, undercutting the prime minister\u2019s promise to unite Iraq\u2019s political forces.\nKenneth M. Hillas, the leader of the American reconstruction team here, said the election results in Babil, like elsewhere, underscored the deeply fragmented nature of Iraqi politics.\nThe effort to form regional governments out of the pieces, he said, was now consuming leaders in Baghdad \u2014 and even those in neighboring countries, presumably Iran, though he declined to say so explicitly \u2014 interested in shoring up power before the national vote. Iraq\u2019s Shiite political parties, including the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, maintain close ties to Iran\u2019s Shiite leaders.\n\u201cThough we don\u2019t maybe readily see it, there are Iraqis and other neighboring countries that worry about the implications of a split in the Shiite political coalition and what impact that will have on the national elections,\u201d Mr. Hillas said.\nThe elections were important because they were meant to codify the powers of the central government and the provincial ones. The councils have the authority to legislate and to tax, and, in theory, the power to provide services that remain meager.\nThe elections heightened expectations among voters that have already dimmed, according to people interviewed across Iraq this week. Political disillusion is taking root in a country that has had only five years of democracy.\n\u201cWe need a miracle to change,\u201d said Salim Najim, a driver in Basra, where the selection of a governor proved to be fraught.\nIn largely Sunni provinces, including Anbar and Nineveh, the election of Sunni-controlled councils has alienated the members of opposition groups, who have demonstrated in the streets and boycotted council meetings. The same thing happened in Wasit, a largely Shiite province southeast of Baghdad. On April 6, American troops intervened to stop Iraqi police officers from arresting four new council members in Diyala, northeast of Baghdad.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real expression of the democracy Iraq has achieved,\u201d said the former governor of Babil, Salem Salih al-Muslimawi, who was elected to the new council, \u201cbut the hopes of the people are still left hanging.\u201d\nBabil\u2019s provincial capital, Hilla, is a dilapidated city near the ruins of Babylon, the city that nearly 4,000 years ago produced one of civilization\u2019s first written legal and administrative codes.\nToday, sewage flows into the Euphrates there. Hilla\u2019s streets are potholed and littered with garbage. Of the 42 textile factories that operated here in 2005, only 2 remain open, said Amir Mahmoud Chabok, chairman of the Iraqi Federation of Industries in Babil. Agribusinesses struggle with declining fuel subsidies, rising rents and sporadic electricity.\n\u201cThe people of Hilla expect better services,\u201d said Karim Fakhri Helal, a dean at Babil University. \u201cThey expect electricity. They expect jobs.\u201d\nHe complained that Babil\u2019s new council had instead been preoccupied with consolidating power and dividing the spoils.\nEven more ominous for provincial governments is Iraq\u2019s financial crisis. Babil\u2019s budget this year has been slashed to $135 million from $258 million last year. And the payment of budget funds is late, hindering the new council\u2019s work before it even begins.\nWhen Babil\u2019s new council met for the first time on Sunday \u2014 three days behind the deadline \u2014 its 30 members celebrated the peaceful transfer of authority from the old council elected in Iraq\u2019s first provincial elections in 2005 to the new one.\nThe tensions that dominate Iraq\u2019s political life quickly surfaced. A man stood and denounced one council member\u2019s reference to the violence that has consumed the country since 2003 as \u201ca side effect\u201d of democracy.\nAnother council member, Fawziya Hassan Kadum, demanded the release of prisoners, including her husband, arrested by American and Iraqi forces in 2007. \u201cRelease our sons!\u201d she shouted. \u201cRelease our daughters!\u201d The audience applauded.\nThe new council\u2019s first order of business \u2014 electing a chairman and a governor \u2014 remained unresolved, however, as national leaders representing Mr. Maliki\u2019s Dawa Party, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and the Shiite cleric in exile Moktada al-Sadr bargained in Baghdad that night.\n\u201cWe are not as progressive a democracy in experience as Sweden or the United States,\u201d Mr. Bekari said. \u201cEverything has to be settled in Baghdad, not in the provinces.\u201d\nA presentation about the council\u2019s new powers by an American nongovernmental organization, the Research Triangle Institute, was drowned out by lawmakers milling about. They adjourned after lunch without a vote.\nOn Tuesday, after three days of talks, Babil\u2019s council elected a chairman, Kadum Majid Tuman. He represents the Sadrists, who boycotted the 2005 elections but now seek a political accommodation with Mr. Maliki\u2019s bloc.\nThe deal left out the council\u2019s members from the Islamic Supreme Council, who stormed out in protest, refusing to vote.\nThe province, meanwhile, still has no governor. \u201cThe political situation is strangled in Babil,\u201d Mr. Bekari said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/world/middleeast/16province.html", "title": "Iraq Provinces Try to Overcome Political Disarray", "author": "STEVEN LEE MYERS"}

His father was similarly prepared decades ago by assuming low-level jobs with the ruling Workers Party of Korea. Mr. Kim took over the North Korean helm when his father, President Kim Il-sung, died in 1994.\nLike most news about the inner workings of the Kim family, the latest report could not be independently confirmed. South Korean media often carry conflicting reports about the Kim family. Yonhap had earlier reported that Kim Jong-un would be elected to the rubber-stamp Parliament in March as a way to speed up his apprenticeship. That didn\u2019t happen.\nMedia reports about Mr. Kim\u2019s three known sons, especially about Jung-un, have spiked in recent weeks. Mr. Kim, who reportedly suffered a stroke in August, is said to be focusing now on securing a succession of power for one of his sons.\nEarlier this month, the Parliament re-elected Mr. Kim as chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission. Two of his most trusted aides \u2014 Oh Geung-nyeol, a general, and Jang Seong-taek, Mr. Kim\u2019s brother-in-law \u2014 also were elected to the commission.\nThe appointments of Mr. Oh and Mr. Jang have led to reports about their possible roles in choosing Mr. Kim\u2019s successor, or in one of them becoming the leader himself in the post-Kim era. But those reports, too, were based mostly on conjecture by outside analysts.\nExperts often vary widely in their theories about Mr. Kim\u2019s motives. Only a few years ago, many analysts, as well as news outlets in South Korea, had dismissed Mr. Jang, believing him to be persona non grata in the regime because he had suddenly disappeared from the public scene. But about a year ago, he returned to politics.\nMeanwhile, little is known about Mr. Kim\u2019s youngest son. Officials and analysts believe he was born in late 1983 or early 1984.\nHe reportedly liked basketball and looked and acted like his father. As a teenager, he studied at the International School of Berne in Switzerland.\nMr. Kim has three known sons by two women. The oldest, Kim Jong-nam, 37, was once considered the undisputed successor. But he reportedly fell out of his father\u2019s favor when he was caught sneaking into Japan on a fake Dominican Republic passport in 2001. He told Japanese authorities that he had planned to visit Tokyo\u2019s Disney resort.\nAfter Kim Jung-nam\u2019s apparent disgrace, the middle son, Kim Jong-chol, 27, was cited as a favorite candidate for several years. Mr. Kim\u2019s former Japanese sushi chef, Kenji Fujimoto, said in his memoir that the leader considers his second son \u201cgirlish.\u201d And recent South Korean and Japanese news reports have said that he is chronically ill.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/world/asia/28korea.html", "title": "Kim\u2019s Son Is Said to Join N.

{"date": "Sat, 10 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistani commandos rescued 42 hostages early Sunday who were held by militants inside the nation\u2019s military headquarters, after gunmen dressed in army fatigues stormed the building in a brazen attack 18 hours earlier, according to the chief army spokesman.\nFour militants and three hostages were killed in the operation, the spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said. He said that the militants, who had taken both soldiers and civilians hostage, had been armed with explosives.\nA series of loud explosions and gunshots were heard at the headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi at 6 a.m., shortly before the army announced the freeing of the hostages.\nThe attack was the third by Taliban militants in Pakistan in a week, and it is a singular embarrassment for the Pakistani Army, exposing its vulnerability to the insurgency that is closely linked with Al Qaeda. It came as the military was planning an offensive against the Taliban in South Waziristan, and it was seen as a statement by the militants that they could attack the army first.\nIn the initial assault on the headquarters, six people, including a brigadier and a colonel, were killed as the militants broke through a checkpoint in a van. The army had reported initially that there were 10 to 15 hostages.\nThe army said Sunday that commandos captured the last militant who took part in the assault. He was identified by the army as Aqeel, who also used the alias Dr. Ufman.\nThe Obama administration, which is in the midst of reassessing its strategy for the region, has asked the Pakistani military to step up its efforts against the Taliban.\nAmerican military officials said they were astonished that the militants could penetrate the high-security installation to the extent that they did.\nOne official, speaking anonymously, said the siege represented \u201ca major security lapse.\u201d\nEven before ending the standoff, the government vowed to carry out its Waziristan offensive.\n\u201cI want to give a message to the Taliban that what we did with you in Swat, we will do the same to you there, too,\u201d Interior Minister Rehman Malik said, referring to the Swat Valley, where the army drove out the Taliban last summer. He identified the militants involved in the assault as Pakistani Taliban.\nThe militants\u2019 attack began about 11:30 a.m. Saturday, when 8 to 10 gunmen drove up to what was considered a heavily fortified compound. After a 45-minute gunfight, four of the attackers were killed, General Abbas said, and several others fled into the building. Once inside, the militants took hostages.\nThe attack on the headquarters came after the new leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, warned that the army had become the militants\u2019 main target. The army announced two weeks ago that it planned a major offensive in South Waziristan, the Taliban\u2019s stronghold.\nMr. Mehsud said last weekend that the Taliban would not let the planned offensive go unanswered. It was his first news conference since taking over from Baitullah Mehsud, who was killed in a missile attack by an American drone in August.\nThe assault and other recent attacks could be the start of the escalation Mr. Mehsud warned about, military analysts said.\nIn one attack, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the headquarters of the United Nations World Food Program in Islamabad on Monday, killing five United Nations workers. That attack seemed designed to intimidate international aid workers and the agency that the Taliban has said should leave Pakistan.\nIn Peshawar, the capital of North-West Frontier Province, a car bomb killed 48 people in the busiest bazaar at noon on Friday, when it was most crowded. It was one of the most lethal attacks in a city that has become a consistent target of the Taliban.\nSecurity analysts said the militants had cells planted through out Punjab, the most populous province, and had clearly refined assault techniques from its close links with Al Qaeda in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas.\nAccording to an account from a senior Pakistani military official who was at the scene when the Rawalpindi attack began, there was initial confusion because the attackers were dressed in army fatigues, and security officers could not tell the difference between soldiers and militants, he said. The van they were driving had military plates, allowing them to approach the checkpoints with less suspicion, an American military official said.\nThe militants were a mixed group, the Pakistani military official said. Some came from the tribal areas, some from Punjab and some from Kashmir. The men made calls on their cellphones demanding release of prisoners from government custody, the official said.\nAnother witness, Mansoor Ahmed, told the Geo television network that the men in the van were stopped at a gate. \u201cSoon heavy firing started,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw one terrorist falling down. They have also used hand grenades.\u201d\nAs the siege developed at the headquarters, the chief of the Pakistani military, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, was shown on Pakistani television meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari on the contentious issue of a $7.5 billion, five-year American aid package that the army says interferes with Pakistan\u2019s national security.\nPakistani television reported that Mr. Zardari, who has hailed the aid as a major triumph but has come under direct criticism from the army for accepting its conditions, had agreed to take up the army\u2019s objections with the Obama administration.\nThe aid package, aimed at bolstering civilian infrastructure, is separate from military aid, of which the United States has provided $10 billion since 2001.\nThe army had been riding high in public opinion after its offensive against Taliban forces in the Swat Valley in the summer pushed militants out of the area. Stepped up security in Islamabad and Peshawar appeared to have quelled militant attacks in the last few months.\nAnd a lull in bombings after Baitullah Mehsud\u2019s death was interpreted by security analysts as a sign that the Taliban were in disarray.\nBut the new Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, appeared intent to launch strikes before the army struck in South Waziristan, said a retired senior army officer, Brig. Mehmood Shah.\nA commentator on national security and former senior police officer, Arbab Hidayatullah, said Saturday that the attack had occurred because the military had so far failed to \u201cdeliver the mother of all battles\u201d in South Waziristan, giving the \u201cterrorists a free hand to deliver themselves.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/world/asia/11pstan.html", "title": "Pakistan Retakes Army Headquarters; Hostages Freed", "author": "JANE PERLEZ"}
{"date": "Sun, 22 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Her twin sisters were killed trying to flee Falluja in 2004. Then her husband was killed by a car bomb in Baghdad just after she had become pregnant. When her own twins were 5 months old, one was killed by an explosive planted in a Baghdad market.\nNow, Nacham Jaleel Kadim, 23, lives with her remaining daughter in a trailer park for war widows and their families in one of the poorest parts of Iraq\u2019s capital.\nThat makes her one of the lucky ones. The trailer park, called Al Waffa, or \u201cPark of the Grateful,\u201d is among the few aid programs available for Iraq\u2019s estimated 740,000 widows. It houses 750 people.\nAs the number of widows has swelled during six years of war, their presence on city streets begging for food or as potential recruits by insurgents has become a vexing symbol of the breakdown of Iraqi self-sufficiency.\nWomen who lost their husbands had once been looked after by an extended support system of family, neighbors and mosques.\nBut as the war has ground on, government and social service organizations say the women\u2019s needs have come to exceed available help, posing a threat to the stability of the country\u2019s tenuous social structures.\nWith the economy limping along, dependent almost entirely on the price of crude oil, and the government preoccupied with rebuilding and quelling sectarian violence, officials acknowledge that little is likely to change soon.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t help everybody,\u201d said Leila Kadim, a managing director in the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. \u201cThere are too many.\u201d\nAmong Iraqi women aged 15 to 80, 1 in 11 are estimated to be widows, though officials admit that figure is hardly more than a guess, given the continuing violence and the displacement of millions of people. A United Nations report estimated that during the height of sectarian violence here in 2006, 90 to 100 women were widowed each day.\nIn large cities like Baghdad, the presence of war widows is difficult to ignore. Cloaked in black abayas, they wade through columns of cars idling at security checkpoints, asking for money or food. They wait in line outside mosques for free blankets, or sift through mounds of garbage piled along the street. Some live with their children in public parks or inside gas station restrooms.\nOfficials at social service agencies tell of widows coerced into \u201ctemporary marriages\u201d \u2014 relationships sanctioned by Shiite tradition, often based on sex, which can last from an hour to years \u2014 to get financial help from government, religious or tribal leaders.\nOther war widows have become prostitutes, and some have joined the insurgency in exchange for steady pay. The Iraqi military estimates that the number of widows who have become suicide bombers may be in the dozens.\nIn the past several weeks, even as the government has formed commissions to study the problem, it has begun a campaign to arrest beggars and the homeless, including war widows.\nThe issue has burst into public view in some unusual ways recently. When an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at President Bush in December, he shouted that he was doing so on behalf of the war\u2019s widows and orphans. During the campaign for last month\u2019s provincial elections, political rallies featured heart-rending songs of the suffering of widows.\nThose sentiments, though, have yet to translate into political action.\nEfforts to increase the government stipend for widows \u2014 currently about $50 a month and an additional $12 per child \u2014 have stalled. By comparison, the price of a five-liter container of gasoline, used for cars as well as home generators, is about $4.\nStill, only about 120,000 widows \u2014 roughly one in six \u2014 receive any state aid, according to government figures. Widows and their advocates say that to receive benefits they must either have political connections or agree to temporary marriages with the powerful men who control the distribution of government funds.\n\u201cIt is blackmail,\u201d said Samira al-Mosawi, chairwoman of the women\u2019s affairs committee in Parliament. \u201cWe have no law to treat this point. Widows don\u2019t need temporary support, but a permanent solution.\u201d\nThe latest plan, proposed by Mazin al-Shihan, director of the Baghdad Displacement Committee, a city agency, is to pay men to marry widows. \u201cThere is no serious effort by the national government to fix this problem, so I presented my own program,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked why the money should not go directly to the women, Mr. Shihan laughed.\n\u201cIf we give the money to the widows, they will spend it unwisely because they are uneducated and they don\u2019t know about budgeting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we find her a husband, there will be a person in charge of her and her children for the rest of their lives. This is according to our tradition and our laws.\u201d\nAbdulalah F. Alafar, who runs the Maryam Establishment for Children charity in Baghdad, said he had become so frustrated by the lack of government support that he had begun to turn away war widows. He said he planned to close his organization entirely this month.\n\u201cIf the situation progresses, we will be just like India,\u201d he said. Questioning the government\u2019s priorities, he added, \u201cThey are busy building public fountains when we don\u2019t have water in the sink.\u201d\nThe trailer park, in Baghdad\u2019s Al Shaab district, opened four months ago. Its 150 identical aluminum trailers sit in neat rows amid a vast field of puddles, their white exteriors already stained tan by blowing sand.\nA short walk down a muddy path from Ms. Kadim\u2019s trailer, Ahmed Hassan Sharmal, 58, and his extended family of 30 are moving into trailer numbers 39 and 40. Three of his daughters-in-law are widows. Fatherless children seem to fill every bit of the trailers\u2019 available space, playing and giggling while their mothers wonder where everyone will sleep.\nMr. Sharmal, a Shiite, lost three sons to sectarian violence in Diyala Province, which was a center of the Sunni insurgency, during a 10-month period in 2006.\nOne son, a doctor, was killed in a parking garage as he walked to his car. A second died after gunmen sprayed bullets across a field of soccer players. The third, a police officer, was shot in the back of the head while on his way to work.\nJinan, 25, had been married to the doctor. She has no money and little freedom. One of her brothers-in-law, an unemployed former police officer, said he planned to marry her, a match arranged by her in-laws. As he spoke, her 4-year-old son squirmed in her mother-in-law\u2019s lap.\nSoon, Jinan will no longer be a widow, but she refuses to look at the man chosen to be her husband. As she hangs her head as if to cry, the conversation continues without her.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/world/middleeast/23widows.html", "title": "Iraq\u2019s War Widows Face Dire Need With Little Aid", "author": "TIMOTHY WILLIAMS"}

Under another sequence of events, sea levels could rise 39 inches by 2080, affecting 2.5 million people in the Manila Bay area.\nThe authors of the report urged governments to build infrastructure adapted to climate change, arguing that the current economic crisis was not incompatible with combating and adapting to global warming.\n\u201cThe investment in climate change adaptation can serve as an effective fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Tae Yong Jung, another author of the report.\nSoutheast Asia is particularly vulnerable to global warming because of the number of people who live near coastlines and the high rate of poverty. About 19 percent of those in Southeast Asian, some 93 million people, live on less than $1.25 a day and are more vulnerable to the projected increase in typhoons, drought and floods.\nThe region also has a high percentage of agricultural workers, more than 40 percent of the population, who would face a decline in the production of rubber, rice, corn and other crops because of extreme weather, the report said.\nThe number of fish in the oceans is also likely to decline because of changes in currents caused by a warmer atmosphere.\nIn cities like Manila, Bangkok and Jakarta, which are already stiflingly hot for several months of the year, average temperatures in 2100 could be nine degrees hotter, the report says, using data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, the cities will be like an oven,\u201d Mr. Zhuang said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/world/asia/27climate.html", "title": "Study Says Warming Poses Peril to Asia", "author": "THOMAS FULLER"}

Under the proposal, the uranium would be shipped to France and Russia in exchange for more highly enriched fuel rods that are not suitable for use in weapons.\nSpeaking on Iran\u2019s state television, Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said late on Thursday that Turkey, which is a neighbor of Iran and has good relations with the West, could be the site for exchanging nuclear material.\nIran \u201cdoes not have a problem with Turkish soil\u201d as the location for an exchange of enriched uranium for nuclear fuel, he said.\nIn Turkey, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu welcomed the Iranian announcement and said his government would do its best to help reach a diplomatic solution to the standoff over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nIran had previously said that it would accept such an exchange only on its own territory.\nThe United States and its allies have demanded that Iran accept the terms of the United Nations-brokered plan without changes.\nUnder the plan, drafted last month, Iran would export its low-enriched uranium for further enrichment in Russia and France, where it would be converted into fuel rods. The rods, which Iran needs for a research reactor in Tehran, would be returned to the country about a year later.\nExporting the uranium would temporarily leave Iran without enough stockpiles to further enrich the uranium into the material for a nuclear warhead, and the rods that are returned could not be used to make weapons.\nIran says it has no intention of building a bomb, maintaining that its program is for generating electricity.\nAt various times, Iran has proposed swapping material in batches, which would not necessarily reduce its ability to build a bomb. At other times it has insisted on a simultaneous swap inside Iran, or threatened to produce the fuel rods on its own.\nMr. Mottaki said that the West needed to prove its good intentions toward Iran first.\n\u201cExchange is acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to do the trust-building; then it is pursuable.\u201d\nIran is able to produce the fuel on its own, Mr. Mottaki said, calling this a \u201cpreferable\u201d option, while adding that Iran is still ready for talks with the West.\n\u201cThe ball is in their own court,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should answer us. Threat and sanctions are useless.\u201d\nLow-enriched uranium is used to fuel a nuclear energy reactor, but highly enriched uranium can be turned into a nuclear warhead. Once converted into rods, the uranium cannot be enriched further.\nThe United Nations has demanded that Iran suspend all enrichment, a demand that Tehran has refused, saying it has a right to develop the technology for peaceful purposes under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Iran has also announced that it intends to build 10 new uranium enrichment sites, drawing a rebuke from the United Nation nuclear watchdog agency.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/world/middleeast/26iran.html", "title": "Iran Says It Would Swap Nuclear Material With West in Turkey", "author": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}

The party also appeared to have lost control of Western Cape Province.\nThe final tabulations may not be completed until the weekend. But the A.N.C. began celebrating Thursday evening with thousands of supporters dancing and singing in the streets of downtown Johannesburg.\nMr. Zuma, 67, a genial, energetic man with a bald head and a husky frame, led the revelers in his signature anthem, \u201cBring Me My Machine Gun,\u201d a song with roots in the A.N.C. military training camps during the struggle against apartheid.\nIn the last national election, in 2004, the A.N.C. won 70 percent of the vote, its largest majority ever. But the party that led the nation to its liberation is still smarting from infighting that caused dissidents to compete in this election under their own banner.\nThe Congress of the People was at first expected to present a strong challenge. Instead, it failed to gain traction as an independent voice. It was in third place with less than 8 percent of the vote.\nBut there does seem to be one cliffhanger Friday in the election. Though the A.N.C. is winning in eight of the nation\u2019s nine provinces, the Democratic Alliance, led by Cape Town\u2019s mayor, Helen Zille, is ahead in the Western Cape with 51 percent. If it maintains that majority, however slim, it will seize control of the province from the A.N.C. and be able to govern there without any coalition partners.\nNationally, the Democratic Alliance was in second place, drawing 15 percent in the incomplete returns. In the 2004 election, it finished second with 12 percent.\nMs. Zille, a former journalist and anti-apartheid activist, has been an extremely popular mayor in the seaside city. She is white in a nation that is 79 percent black. But the racial mix of the Western Cape is decidedly different from that in the rest of South Africa, with more than 70 percent either white or of mixed race.\nNationally, the Democratic Alliance was in second place, drawing 16 percent in the incomplete returns. In the 2004 election, it finished second with 12 percent.\nIn recent days, Ms. Zille introduced a \u201cStop Zuma\u201d theme to her campaign, warning that if the A.N.C. retained its two-thirds majority in Parliament, Mr. Zuma would become a \u201cone-man Constitution-wrecking machine,\u201d warping the nation\u2019s laws to venal purpose.\n\u201cAnybody who didn\u2019t register to vote or didn\u2019t bother to vote should actually look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves whether they contributed to a two-thirds majority for a man we believe is corrupt and doesn\u2019t respect the Constitution,\u201d Ms. Zille said Thursday evening in a television interview.\nThat comment is typical of the invective frequently aimed at Mr. Zuma. Indeed, he has endured his share of scandal, including a trial for rape and a criminal indictment for accepting bribes. Though he has never been convicted of anything, many South Africans, especially whites and Asians, find something unsavory and frightening about him, saying he may become another Robert Mugabe and turn the nation into another Zimbabwe.\nSouth Africa has the continent\u2019s largest economy, but half the population is destitute, and Mr. Zuma comes from these downtrodden. A Zulu, he was born in the rural hinterlands of what is now called KwaZulu-Natal. His father, a policeman, died when Jacob was a small child. Instead of going to school he tended cattle and goats. He told one biographer that for a time he and other herd boys pooled their money to pay a tutor in the evenings.\nAt age 17, Mr. Zuma joined the A.N.C., which was then illegal, and served in Umkhonto, its military wing. In 1963, the apartheid government convicted him of trying to overthrow the government. He served 10 years in the same island prison that held Nelson Mandela.\nMr. Zuma is comfortable in the parallel worlds of modern Africa, wearing a business suit among international financiers and leopard skins for tribal ceremonies. He refuses to discuss his private life but he proudly practices polygamy and has observers speculating whether he has been married four, five or six times.\nHis political rise has been supported by the A.N.C.\u2019s allies in the trade unions and the South African Communist Party, and yet he has also managed to convince businessmen that he is anything but a financial boat rocker, insisting that he will largely continue the nation\u2019s economic policies even as he tries to provide a sturdier safety net for the poor.\nThursday night, as he danced, Mr. Zuma made light of both his critics and the political analysts who thought his party was flagging. \u201cFor those who do not know the A.N.C., you touch the A.N.C., you touch a lion,\u201d he boasted.\nA record 23 million South Africans were registered to vote in Wednesday\u2019s election, in a country of 48.7 million. Twenty-six political parties were competing. The Independent Election Commission estimated that the turnout was above 80 percent.\nSeats in Parliament are allocated based on the election results, and then Parliament elects the president. Mr. Zuma is expected to take office in early May.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/world/africa/25safrica.html", "title": "Governing Party Claims Victory in South Africa", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}

{"date": "Thu, 17 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 A powerful suicide bomb that killed six Italian soldiers here on Thursday prompted Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy to declare that his nation had begun planning to \u201cbring our young men home as soon as possible.\u201d\nIn Brussels, Mr. Berlusconi, a close American ally but in some political trouble at home, was careful to say that Italy would not unilaterally withdraw its 3,100 troops from Afghanistan, though he said he wanted the withdrawal to happen \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d But it seemed the strongest expression yet from a European leader of the rising doubts about the Afghanistan mission among America\u2019s allies.\n\u201cWe are all convinced that it would be best for everyone, whoever they are, to remove our conspicuous presence from Afghanistan quickly,\u201d Mr. Berlusconi said.\nSenior elected officials in Germany and Britain have also expressed weariness with the mission as violence has increased and casualties have mounted.\nMeantime, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan dismissed complaints that the Aug. 20 presidential election had been marred by widespread fraud and ballot-stuffing, saying he was \u201csurprised and rather shocked\u201d that European Union election monitors had warned that 1.1 million of his 3.1 million votes were suspicious. Western governments, he said, should \u201crespect the people\u2019s vote.\u201d\nMr. Karzai conceded that some government officials had been \u201cpartial\u201d to him and some to other candidates, in what appeared to be his first acknowledgment that some fraud had occurred. He said, however, there was little evidence of widespread irregularities. \u201cI believe firmly, firmly in the integrity of the election,\u201d Mr. Karzai said.\nThe election monitors said 300,000 of the 1.6 million votes for Mr. Karzai\u2019s closest competitor, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah, also needed to be reviewed.\nPreliminary tallies have Mr. Karzai winning 54.6 percent of the vote. But at least 15 percent of the ballots are now being audited for fraud under orders from a United Nations-backed commission.\nA number of Western diplomats are convinced that if all fraudulent ballots were discarded, Mr. Karzai would be left with less than 50 percent of the vote, forcing him into a runoff with Mr. Abdullah. If a runoff were ordered, the harsh winter weather here could prevent it from taking place until April, deepening the leadership vacuum for months.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Abdullah said that he would not join in any coalition government with Mr. Karzai, and that no one from his camp had held any discussions with Karzai officials about forming a coalition. \u201cIllegitimate rule in itself is a recipe for instability,\u201d he said, urging that fraud investigations be pursued to the end.\nThe dispute over the election risks leaving the country with a government widely seen as illegitimate and undermining efforts to bolster commitments for troops and other resources from Western countries.\nIf Mr. Berlusconi does remove Italian troops from Afghanistan quickly, it will not be the first time he has reconsidered a military commitment. Although he supported the war in Iraq from the outset, in 2006 he decided to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq; that war had become deeply unpopular with Italians, and Mr. Berlusconi was facing a national election, in which he was eventually defeated.\nRe-elected in 2008, Mr. Berlusconi has maintained strong support for the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan. Yet after a summer of sex scandals, his grip has been loosening over his center-right coalition, which includes parties that advocate staying in Afghanistan and others demanding withdrawal.\nIn televised remarks in Brussels late Thursday evening, Mr. Berlusconi said that Italy planned in the coming weeks to withdraw the 500 additional troops it had sent to Afghanistan before the presidential election last month. \u201cBut we have to decide that in the cabinet and with our allies,\u201d he added.\nMr. Berlusconi, who looked tired and tense, emphasized that there would be a reduction in troops, not a full withdrawal. \u201cWe should not abandon this undertaking,\u201d he said.\nEarlier in the day, Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Northern League, arguably the most powerful party in Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s coalition, reiterated his calls for an immediate withdrawal of Italian troops. \u201cI hope by Christmas everyone can come home,\u201d Mr. Bossi said, according to the news agency ANSA.\nBut the Italian defense minister, Ignazio La Russa, said in Parliament that the bomb attack would not stop Italy\u2019s \u201cfirm commitment\u201d to the international mission.\nThe powerful suicide car bomb exploded about noon in central Kabul near the heart of the American and NATO military command. It blew an Italian armored vehicle across two lanes of traffic and, according to Italian officials, left six soldiers dead and four wounded.\nAfghan officials said 10 Afghan civilians were also killed and 52 wounded, many at a small bazaar of vegetable stands and other shops on the side of the road. Pieces of human flesh were strewn about the scene.

It was in effect an indictment of the methods and actions of the man he was defending.\nIn a judicial proceeding, Mr. Roux said, rules are sacrosanct, the final line of defense of impartial justice.\n\u201cWe are defending a man, and although this man has acknowledged responsibility, he is entitled to a fair trial,\u201d he said. \u201cThe work we are doing is hard work but essential, and we can only do our work if we respect the rule of law, respect the rights of the accused and respect the principle of an adversarial proceeding.\u201d\nDuch, 66, in a crisp blue shirt and a new pair of glasses, leaned forward from time to time and conferred earnestly with his lawyers, lifting simultaneous-translation headphones from his ears.\n\u201cI repeat that we respect the victims,\u201d Mr. Roux said. \u201cWe also owe respect to the accused, and we also must respect the rule of law.\u201d\nThe child survivor was just discovered and presented to the press on Monday, adding his name to a very short list of people who through chance or good fortune had evaded the death sentence that was the first step in the judicial process of Tuol Sleng.\nThe three other known survivors who are still alive attended the hearing, along with hundreds of diplomats, journalists, human rights workers and other victims of the Khmer Rouge who had joined the case as civil parties.\n\u201cI could not sleep last night,\u201d said one of the survivors, Vann Nath, 62. \u201cI was waiting for the sunrise so that I could see Duch in the dock.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI think he is a very fortunate person, a very lucky person. Because when I was in jail, I could get three spoons of porridge a day and both my legs were put in shackles.\u201d\nIn an attempt to create an agrarian utopia, the Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as much as one-fourth of the population through starvation, exhaustion and disease, as well as torture and execution.\nFour other senior officials of the Khmer Rouge are in custody, waiting to follow Duch into court, perhaps next year.

It was crossing an area lined with trees at 9 a.m. when it encountered a NATO roadblock run by soldiers clearing the road of roadside bombs, Afghan officials said. The bus was told to drive along the dirt next to the road, but that was where the bomb was hidden, said Niaz Muhammad Sarhadi, the governor of Zhari, a nearby district.\nThe Interior Ministry said that 10 children, 7 women and 13 men were killed. Mr. Sarhadi placed the death toll at 15, with 19 wounded, but said that some of the injuries were serious and that the death toll could rise.\nA NATO spokesman gave a different account of the events, saying that NATO had no record of the explosion\u2019s happening at or near a roadblock.\n\u201cWe had some personnel there after the fact, but they were not involved in directing the bus to a different route,\u201d the spokesman, Chief Petty Officer Brian Naranjo, said.

He saw plastic chairs being lined up outside the building and assumed the only reason people would gather in such a spot would be to mourn.\nIn fact, the devastated building was deliberately chosen as the backdrop for Baghdad\u2019s first outdoor movie screening, an attempt by filmmakers to show that no matter how much blood the militants may spill they cannot kill the artistic imagination.\n\u201cWe wanted to create life in a dead place,\u201d said Bashir al-Majid, one of the lead actors in the movie \u201cAhlam,\u201d which means \u201cDreams\u201d and was screened on Tuesday night.\nThis week, Iraqi feature films will be shown at the sites of four of the most devastating bombings in Baghdad.\nThe event on Tuesday was not an elaborate affair, with the movie screen itself secured with ropes lashed to battered blast walls and scattered debris. Mountains of twisted metal and trash from the gutted building were still piled high in the street.\nAll around, there were reminders of the toll of the attacks that day, which killed more than 160, including 30 children. Near the front of the crowd, a pair of children\u2019s blue jeans lay flattened and bent at one knee, like a chalk outline at a crime scene.\nIt was not just the setting that offered a grim reminder of the tragedies of recent years.\nThe making of \u201cAhlam,\u201d which was shot in 2004, is itself as dramatic a tale as anything Hollywood could devise. It was only the second feature film shot in Iraq after the invasion. To shoot the movie, the producers borrowed a 35-millimeter camera from the director of Iraq\u2019s first postwar feature film, who had fixed the camera himself to make his movie.\n\u201cAhlam\u201d was shot on the run in the streets of Baghdad, with the crew and actors on more than one occasion finding themselves caught in the cross-fire of warring groups. At one point, four members of the crew were kidnapped by a Sunni insurgent group known as Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, then released after a few hours, only to be kidnapped later by a Shiite militia, which in turn handed them over to the American military. The Americans held them in prison for two weeks.\n\u201cWe could not make them understand why Al Qaeda would let us go,\u201d said Yahya al-Allaq, an assistant director on the movie who was one of the people held in custody.\nAt another point, they constructed a set that was meant to look like a Saddam Hussein-era military base. Frightened that the Americans might mistake the set for the real thing, they constructed a 100-foot-long banner and wrote in English: \u201cThis is a movie set.\u201d Still, as they were shooting the scene, an Apache attack helicopter swooped in low overhead and the entire crew scattered, only to come back when the helicopter was long gone.\nThe movie has been shown in more than 60 countries since it was completed in 2005. At the Brooklyn International Film Festival, Mr. Majid won best actor honors.\nHowever, few Iraqis have seen it on the big screen because theaters here remain dismal places.\nWhile Iraqi security forces were present at Tuesday\u2019s screening, securing the surrounding streets, the event was open to everyone.\nThe film drew several dozen spectators, including some people who just happened to be passing by, like Sahib Jaffar, 48. His house is behind the Justice Ministry, and a good friend of his was killed in the October attack.\n\u201cNow we are going through a very critical and dangerous phase,\u201d said Mr. Jaffar, a carpenter. While there are signs of hope, like the movie screening and the crowded parks and vibrant shops, there remains a palpable sense of fear, he said.\nAtia al-Daradji, one of the film\u2019s producers, said he hoped the screening helped combat that fear.\n\u201cThis is meant to be a challenge to the terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is meant to show them there is life.

{"date": "Fri, 25 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON\nFOR Michael B. Oren, the hardest thing about becoming Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States was giving up his American citizenship, a solemn ritual that involves signing an oath of renunciation. He said he got through it with the help of friends from the American Embassy in Tel Aviv who \u201cstayed with me, and hugged me when it was over.\u201d\nBorn in upstate New York, raised in suburban New Jersey and educated at Columbia and Princeton Universities, Mr. Oren considers himself genuinely American. But having lived most of his adult life in Israel \u2014 serving multiple tours in the Israeli Army, once as a paratrooper during the 1982 Lebanon war \u2014 he also considers himself genuinely Israeli.\n\u201cMy decision to move to Israel was very much informed by my American experience,\u201d Mr. Oren, 54, said over breakfast at his residence on a secluded, well-guarded street. \u201cI felt a great deal of pride about being an American in Israel. I never thought there was any conflict in that.\u201d\nThe state of Israel, however, does not allow dual citizens to represent it overseas. So when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Mr. Oren in the spring to be his man in Washington, he had to make a choice.\nNow a foreign national in the land of his birth, Mr. Oren is drawing on his American roots to make Israel\u2019s case, at a time when relations between the countries have been frayed by a dispute over the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Articulate, telegenic and steeped in American culture, he is a smooth spokesman. But he faces an increasingly skeptical audience.\nThis week, after President Obama voiced impatience with the lack of progress in peace talks while meeting in New York with Mr. Netanyahu and the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, Mr. Oren was on hand to give a raft of news media interviews.\n\u201cYou had one gap narrowing between the United States and Israel,\u201d he explained, \u201cwhile another gap was opening and widening between the Israelis, the Palestinians and the United States.\u201d\nIt is the kind of tidy formulation Mr. Oren might have used in one of the dozens of op-ed articles he has written for The New York Times and other newspapers, as a scholar of the Middle East. He has also written several books, including a widely praised account of the 1967 Middle East war and a sprawling study of America\u2019s entanglement in the region, going back to the 1700s.\nBut now Mr. Oren is putting his intellect and persuasive powers into the service of a right-wing Israeli government that does not see eye to eye with the White House. Judging from Mr. Oren\u2019s writing and lectures, it is not clear he is completely eye to eye with his new bosses either.\nHe is on the record as supporting Israel\u2019s unilateral disengagement from Gaza, a decision that led Mr. Netanyahu to leave the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2005. He has also said Israel must withdraw from its settlements in the West Bank, to save itself as a Jewish state.\n\u201cI am the last of the standing unilateralists,\u201d Mr. Oren declared in a lecture in March at Georgetown University, where he was a visiting professor in Jewish studies until being named ambassador.\nA YouTube video of that talk was closely watched in Israel, where some papers questioned whether he was too much of a dove to serve Mr. Netanyahu. Others fretted that he was too much of a hawk, citing an article he wrote during the last American election in which he suggested \u2014 presciently, as it turned out \u2014 that a victory by Barack Obama could lead to friction with Israel.\nToday, Mr. Oren is reluctant to discuss his views on settlements or to criticize Mr. Obama\u2019s policies. But he insists, \u201cI couldn\u2019t serve in this government if I didn\u2019t feel that the government\u2019s positions closely, closely dovetail with what I\u2019ve been feeling for a long, long time.\u201d\nCERTAINLY, Mr. Oren\u2019s fervent Zionism dates from his childhood, though it was hardly inevitable. He grew up as Michael Bornstein in a conservative, but not politically active, family in West Orange, N.J. His father was the director of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center.\nAt 15, Mr. Oren told his parents he wanted to move to Israel to work on a kibbutz. His parents were aghast, but they did not stop him when he talked his way into a job on an alfalfa farm, even though he was two years shy of the minimum age. A job as a cowboy on the Golan Heights followed, as well as athletic glory as an oarsman in the Maccabiah Games, where thousands of Jewish athletes from around the world compete every four years.\n\u201cThe thought of moving to Israel was completely alien to all of us,\u201d Mr. Oren said. \u201cBut for someone who came from a really normal suburban upbringing, this was about as exciting and swashbuckling as you could get.\u201d\nAfter picking up two degrees at Columbia, he moved back to Israel in 1979 and joined the army. That began a three-decade association with the Israel Defense Forces, for which he was a spokesman during the 2006 war in Lebanon and the Israeli crackdown on the militant group Hamas in Gaza in 2008.\nAt 23, Mr. Oren took Israeli citizenship. Like many Jews who move to Israel, he changed his name: Oren means \u201cpine tree\u201d in Hebrew. He also met his wife, Sally, who came from a Zionist family in San Francisco. In 1995, her youngest sister was killed in a terrorist attack on a bus in Jerusalem.\nThe tragedy, he said, \u201cdeepened our commitment.\u201d The couple have three children, all of whom have served in the Israeli military. Their eldest son, Yoav, was shot at close range and wounded by a Hamas fighter in 2004.\nFOR the past two decades, Mr. Oren has mixed scholarship with public service. His book on the 1967 war drew on formerly classified documents from Israeli and Arab archives, and while it revealed blunders on both sides, scholars say it does not have a political bias.\n\u201cI would not call his work ideological,\u201d said Robert J. Lieber, a professor of government at Georgetown who recruited Mr. Oren. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine scholar who lets the scholarship lead him.\u201d\nBut in his current job, Mr. Oren\u2019s communication skills will be more important than his academic pedigree. He has lost no time cultivating Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff, and David Axelrod, a senior adviser, both of whom are Jewish and have a keen interest in Middle East policy.\n\u201cThe fact that Israel is having trouble with liberal America means we need to have someone who understands liberal America,\u201d said Yossi Klein Halevi, a longtime friend and journalist who worked with Mr. Oren at the Shalem Center, a center-right research institute in Jerusalem.\nAs a veteran of real wars and those that rage in academia, Mr. Oren said he was not daunted by the task of representing Israel during a fraught period. He disputes that there is a crisis in American-Israeli relations, characterizing it as a \u201cdisagreement about how to proceed along the peace process.\u201d\nIn the hothouse world of Israeli politics, ambassadors to Washington rarely last more than a couple of years, Mr. Oren said. But he is relishing his shot at a job that he said had tantalized him since he was a teenager, reading about the man who was then Israel\u2019s emissary, Yitzhak Rabin.\n\u201cStates are often created with great upheaval and pain, and Israel is no exception,\u201d Mr. Oren said. \u201cThe great excitement and challenge of living in Israel is that it is a work in progress. It\u2019s like living in this country in 1776.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/world/middleeast/26oren.html", "title": "Israeli Ambassador Draws on American Roots", "author": "MARK LANDLER"}

Gilad Shalit.\nThe Israeli military described the men who were detained as \u201cleaders of the ongoing efforts to restore the administrative branch of the Hamas terror organization in the region.\u201d A spokesman would not comment on any possible link to the Shalit affair.\nIsrael\u2019s departing prime minister, Ehud Olmert, had hoped to secure Corporal Shalit\u2019s release before leaving office. Mr. Olmert is to be succeeded by Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the conservative Likud Party, who has until early April to form a new governing coalition.\nIn return for Corporal Shalit, who was seized by Hamas and other Palestinian militants in a cross-border raid and taken into Gaza in 2006, Hamas demands the release of 450 Palestinians in Israeli jails, including many convicted of deadly attacks on Israelis. But intensive talks held through Egyptian mediators ended this week without an agreement, and Mr. Olmert said Tuesday that his government would not accede to all of Hamas\u2019s demands.\nOfficials here said that Israel was prepared to release some 325 of those requested by Hamas, including many convicted killers. Israel demanded that many of them be confined to Gaza, where Hamas holds sway, or be expelled abroad.\nBut Mr. Olmert said that there were red lines that Israel could not cross, and that some of the prisoners on the Hamas list were considered too dangerous to release. Among them, Israel named 10 prisoners convicted of organizing suicide bombings that have killed scores of Israelis since 2001. The attacks singled out crowded cafes, a hotel where a Passover meal was taking place, a popular disco and a university campus.\nMr. Olmert said the efforts to release the Israeli soldier would not cease. But the handling of the case will probably fall to the next government, which may take a harder line in any further negotiations.\nHamas said Thursday in a statement that Israel\u2019s arrests of Hamas leaders and lawmakers in the West Bank were \u201can attempt to blackmail the resistance and achieve gains in the prisoner case.\u201d\nA committee led by the Israeli justice minister, Daniel Friedmann, is also examining the possibility of limiting the privileges of Hamas prisoners in Israel, like visiting hours and access to television and study programs.\nThe military said those detained overnight were \u201ctaken for questioning by security forces.\u201d\nAmong those arrested was Nasser Eddin al-Shaer, an academic from Nablus in the West Bank. Mr. Shaer served as education minister and deputy prime minister in the Hamas-led government that was formed after the Islamist group won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006.\nHis wife, Huda al-Shaer, said that soldiers arrived at their Nablus home around 2 a.m. and stayed for about an hour before taking Mr. Shaer away. Speaking by telephone, Ms. Shaer said she had asked the soldiers why he was being arrested, \u201cbut they told me it was not my business.\u201d\nSome 40 Hamas legislators have been arrested by Israel since Corporal Shalit\u2019s capture in June 2006; many of them remain in jail.\nMr. Shaer had already been arrested twice during this period, spending a total of about four months in prison, his wife said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/world/middleeast/20mideast.html", "title": "Israel Arrests 10 Hamas Leaders", "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER"}

Thai officials have in the past attributed the violence to the drug trade and other criminal activities.\nA group known as the National Revolutionary Front-Coordinate was the main force in recruiting an estimated 1,800 to 3,000 fighters drawn from more than 100,000 students in southern Thailand\u2019s Islamic school system, the report says.\n\u201cThe classroom is the point of first contact,\u201d the report says. \u201cRecruiters invite those who seem promising devout Muslims of good character who are moved by a history of oppression, mistreatment and the idea of armed jihad to join extracurricular indoctrination programs in mosques or disguised as football training.\u201d\nThe Crisis Group said the report was based on 16 months of interviews with religious teachers and students \u2014 all of whom are unnamed \u2014 involved in underground activities.\nViolence in southern Thailand has been overshadowed by the political crisis in the country, but the southern insurgency remains one of the region\u2019s most deadly and intractable ethnic conflicts.\nUntil recent weeks a two-year crackdown by the Thai military appeared to be reducing violence in the area. But tensions flared this month when a group of masked gunmen opened fire on a crowd of worshipers outside a mosque, killing 10 people and seriously wounding 12. Since the start of this month, 36 people have been killed and more than 100 have been wounded in the region.\nThe victims of the attacks are often Buddhists, notably teachers and government officials, but more than half of those killed in the past five years were Muslims, many labeled by the insurgents as collaborators or spies for the Thai government.\nThe insurgents use many of the same methods in their recruitment \u2014 oath-taking, indoctrination and military training \u2014 as other jihadist groups. But the difference in southern Thailand, the report says, is that recruiters \u201cappeal to Malay nationalism and the oppression of Malay Muslims by Buddhist Thai rulers\u201d rather than invoking a universal Islamic state or a global jihad.\nA pamphlet found at an Islamic school during a raid by security forces in 2005 offered a window into the teachings.\n\u201cOur land is crying and calling and waiting for independence and fraternity,\u201d the pamphlet said. \u201cWe have been treated as second-class citizens or like children of slaves.\u201d\nThe insurgents are helped in their recruitment by reports of torture by the military, disappearances and extrajudicial killings. A Muslim lawyers group counted 74 reports of torture of detainees between June 2007 and April 2008.\nThe recruitment is secretive, and even in schools where insurgents are active, \u201cnot all school administrators, teachers and students may be aware of what is happening, let alone consent to it,\u201d the report says.\nThe government has tried to offer an alternative to the traditional community-based Islamic schools, where instruction is often only in the Malay language, but has met deadly resistance. Over the past five years, 115 public school teachers and education officials have been killed and 200 schools burned in what Human Rights Watch called a \u201csickening trend.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/world/asia/22thai.html", "title": "Thai Rebels Recruiting in Schools, Study Says", "author": "THOMAS FULLER"}
{"date": "Tue, 13 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JOHANNESBURG \u2014 Tens of thousands of people \u2014 some of them wrenched from their homes with only the clothes on their backs \u2014 have been expelled recently from both Angola and Congo in what has been a tit-for-tat immigration dispute between two of Africa\u2019s behemoth neighbors.\nBut after weeks of acrimony, with inflammatory statements a staple in the local news media, both countries on Tuesday finally agreed to suspend the expulsions, said Congo\u2019s information minister, Lambert Mende.\n\u201cThe two heads of state have reached an understanding, and something formal will be signed based on what has been agreed,\u201d Mr. Mende said.\nThe expulsions began in Angola, where the government has been annoyed by the number of impoverished Congolese who cross the border. Some are fleeing the continuing war in their homeland, which has claimed millions of lives. Others cross in search of an economic lift, including those who hope to pluck a fortune from diamond fields.\nAngola has often relied on mass expulsions to discourage the migrants, sending home waves of Congolese from 2003 onward, according to the United Nations. But this year\u2019s expulsions were particularly upsetting.\n\u201cWe never challenged the expulsions themselves; we challenged the way they were being conducted \u2014 all the beating of people and looting their goods, even sometimes their clothes,\u201d Mr. Mende said. \u201cWe began our own expulsions as a kind of retaliation.\u201d\nDuring 27 years of civil war, thousands of Angolans poured across the long, porous border into Congo. Many acquired refugee status, though this apparently failed to keep some from being ousted in recent sweeps.\n\u201cMost of those Angolans had been there for years, working in factories, doing small business, even teachers who were teaching in the schools,\u201d said Maurizio Giuliano, a spokesman in Kinshasa, Congo\u2019s capital, for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nThe largest share of the Angolans came from the western Congo province of Bas-Congo. Most of the Congolese expelled from Angola were taken from an area around the northwestern city of Soyo or the enclave of Cabinda.\nHumanitarian agencies are concerned about the living conditions of about 40,000 uprooted people. Many have made it safely back to their original homes.

{"date": "Sat, 19 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR \u2014 Attending a university overseas has long been an aspiration for many Chinese.\n\u201cMy father said \u2018Why do you want to stay in China? Open your mind, look at the world,\u201d\u2018 said Bao Qianqian, 25.\nThe predictable choice might have been Australia or Britain, where her two sisters and thousands of her countrymen have studied. But Ms. Bao decided to embark on a journey that would keep her closer to her home in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo, improve her English while still giving her the chance to converse with Chinese speakers, and enjoy substantially lower costs.\nShe chose Malaysia, where she is currently a third-year business student at HELP University College, a private institution in Kuala Lumpur.\nWith the appetite for higher education showing no signs of abating among the growing Asian middle class, more countries in Asia are positioning themselves to attract students like Ms. Bao.\nEducators have been stepping up their efforts to exploit the global student market, whether by relaxing quotas on non-local students or encouraging overseas institutions to set up local campuses. The words \u201ceducation hub\u201d have infiltrated the mission statements of governments hoping to attract students to their shores.\nTypically foreign students who pay their own way not only provide a welcome boost for university coffers; they can also represent another stream of talented graduates who may join the local workforce and continue contributing to the economy of their host country after their college days are over.\nIn 2007, more than 2.8 million students were enrolled in higher education institutions outside their country of origin, a 53 percent increase since 1999, according to a Unesco report released in July.\nWhile the United States, Britain and other Western countries continue to draw the most Asian students, the report also showed that Asian students were increasingly attending universities within their own regions.\nIn East Asia and the Pacific, 42 percent of students who left home remained in their region in 2007 compared with 36 percent in 1999, according to the 2009 edition of Unesco\u2019s Global Education Digest. Unesco officials attributed this in part to the growing local availability of higher education.\nSingapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong all want to attract thousands more international students. Malaysia wants 100,000 foreign school and university students by next year, compared with 71,000 enrolled in the current academic year. Singapore hopes to attract 150,000 by 2015, up from 97,000 in 2008. Hong Kong has not set specific targets, but it recently doubled its quota for non-local students in its public universities.\nAll three are attempting to capitalize on the fact that they can offer a university education in English, and often for considerably less than more expensive Western nations can, but each has its own selling points.\nSingapore, which has only three public universities, has made attracting the involvement of foreign institutions central to its \u201cGlobal Schoolhouse\u201d policy.\nSome schools, such as the University of Nevada and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, have established branch campuses in Singapore, while others, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University, offer joint degree programs through local universities.\nThe government, which hopes to increase education services\u2019 share of the gross domestic product to 5 percent in 2015 from 3 percent in 2007, boasts that this enables Asian students to get a degree from world-renowned universities without leaving Asia.\nToh Wee Khiang, executive director for human capital at the Singapore Economic Development Board, said the government aims to attract, develop and retain talent.\n\u201cThe war for talent is at the heart of economic growth, and education plays an important part in creating and sustaining talent in Singapore,\u201d he said, adding that another government agency was linking graduating students with Singaporean employers in key growth industries.\nAlthough Malaysia\u2019s schools are not well known internationally, the country has made progress toward meeting its goal of attracting 80,000 foreign university students and 20,000 secondary and primary school pupils by next year. Most of the 71,000 foreign students now enrolled are in private institutions, because of a 5 percent cap on foreign undergraduates in public universities.\nSince Malaysia liberalized its education sector in the 1990s, allowing the establishment of more private institutions, the number of providers has expanded to 20 public universities, 36 private universities and 5 foreign branch campuses.\nMorshidi Sirat, director of the National Higher Education Research Institute at the Universiti Sains Malaysia, said that now that more Malaysians of Chinese and Indian ethnicity can enroll in public universities, thanks to the removal in 2004 of a quota system that had favored ethnic Malays and indigenous groups, local enrollments have declined slightly at private institutions. Private schools have been trying to attract more foreigners to take their place, he said.\nHong Kong might be better placed to cash in on international students, with three of its institutions ranked in the world\u2019s top 50 universities in the Times Higher Education rankings for 2008. Still, in the 2008-09 academic year, Hong Kong enrolled only about 8,400 non-local students, up from about 3,700 in 2003; more than 90 percent of those came from mainland China.\nThe Hong Kong government imposes a quota on non-local students in public universities, which it increased last year to 20 percent from 10 percent. It has also relaxed employment restrictions and now allows students to remain in Hong Kong for 12 months after graduation, which the government hopes will help enhance the quality of the workforce.\nIn a statement, the Hong Kong Education Bureau said Hong Kong needs to \u201cnurture and attract\u201d talent to sustain its economic and social development.\nCheng Kai-ming, professor of education at the University of Hong Kong, said that Hong Kong suffers from severe space constraints, limiting the abilities of schools to build or expand campuses .\n\u201cThere is always an argument within the government that land is precious and is one of the biggest sources of income for revenues,\u201d he said. \u201cHence, unless higher education is given priority in allocating land, there is practically no space for developing any new institutions.\u201d\nWhile Malaysia may have the edge among price-conscious students, Mr. Morshidi identified Thailand and Vietnam as two low-cost future contenders. Japan has also been admitting large numbers of Chinese and South Korean students as its domestic enrollments have declined.\nDespite the best efforts of universities around the region, their success may be influenced by factors beyond their immediate control. Education researchers say after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States and the subsequent tightening of its visa rules, some students began looking for alternatives. Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation, was among the countries to benefit.\nOf the more established providers, Australia, which counts education as its third-largest export after iron ore and coal, may have more cause for concern than others. Its reputation as a safe destination offering high quality education took a battering this year after what many have dubbed \u201cracist attacks\u201d on Indian students in Melbourne and Sydney.\nBut Chris Nyland, a professor of international business at Monash University in Melbourne, said an increase in the countries pushing for foreign students did not necessarily mean Australia\u2019s share of the market would decline. \u201cThere are more suppliers coming into the industry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are more and more people in China and India who can afford higher education.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/world/asia/20study.html", "title": "Asian Universities Seek Students From Nearby Shores", "author": "LIZ GOOCH"}

A resident of Chicago, he was hired for the job in January 2007, according to State Department officials.\nThe attack also killed an American soldier and a civilian working for the Defense Department. Their names were being withheld pending notification of relatives. Two civilians working for the Defense Department were wounded, the officials said.\nThe attack took place within a few miles of the bridge where four American contractors were killed in March 2004, their bodies burned and mutilated, and dragged through the streets. The jarring images of that attack were a major factor in the American military\u2019s decision to begin its first major offensive in Falluja, a center of the Sunni insurgency, months later.\nIt would take four often bloody years and another major assault, but when the Marines finally prepared to leave their sprawling base on the outskirts of the city in December, commanders expressed high hopes that the pacification of the insurgency would demonstrate that security gains would hold even as the American role was reduced.\nFalluja, west of Baghdad, is more stable than it was when the contractors were killed in 2004, but Iraqi political and tribal leaders say they worry that if the Sunni insurgents who later reconciled with the Americans are not made to feel that they have a place in the central government, they will again turn to violence.\nChristopher R. Hill, the newly appointed ambassador to Iraq, issued a statement condemning the attack. \u201cWe and all who are working for a brighter future for Iraq condemn this terrible attack in the strongest possible terms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe remain committed as ever to helping Iraqis achieve the peace, stability and prosperity that will make such acts of terror a thing of the past.\u201d\nThe Americans were driving along a road used exclusively by the American military and reconstruction teams when a bomb, which local Iraqi security officials described as an improvised explosive device, went off. No Iraqi vehicles, even those of the army and the police, are allowed to use the road where the attack occurred, according to residents. There is a checkpoint only 200 yards from the site of the attack to prevent unauthorized vehicles, the residents said.\nThe attack happened as the Americans were returning from an inspection of a wastewater treatment plant being built in Falluja, which Ambassador Hill said was the largest and most complex American-financed project in Anbar Province.\nAnother attack on a convoy of contractors in Falluja was carried out a week ago by assailants with grenades, but no one was killed, according to an Iraqi security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/world/middleeast/27iraq.html", "title": "State Department Official Is Among 3 Killed in Iraq", "author": "MARC SANTORA"}

{"date": "Fri, 10 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MADRID \u2014 One day last month, Sister Mar\u00eda Victoria Vindel gave her 15-year-old students a shockingly graphic lecture on reproductive health: PowerPoint slides of dismembered and disfigured fetuses interspersed with biblical quotations and pictures of a grinning Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, Spain\u2019s prime minister.\n\u201cThey laugh while many innocent children will die,\u201d one of the captions read. The presentation ended with the message, \u201cNo to abortion, yes to life!\u201d\nSister Vindel\u2019s class at Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n y Santa Mar\u00eda Micaela, a parochial school in Logro\u00f1o in northern Spain, is the most controversial episode yet in an increasingly contentious debate about Mr. Zapatero\u2019s plans to ease Spain\u2019s restrictive abortion law.\nThe class was described by the mother of a student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of possible repercussions for her child, and by Inmaculada Ortega, a Socialist lawmaker who spoke to several students and their parents.\nThe school, where Sister Vindel is headmistress, refused to comment on the slide show, which appeared to be downloaded from the Internet. The regional government, run by the opposition Popular Party, sent inspectors to the school, a Catholic institution that is financed partly by the state and partly by the parents. The government called the presentation \u201cinappropriate\u201d and said that it could constitute \u201cmoral aggression.\u201d\nSince he became prime minister in 2004, Mr. Zapatero has pushed an ambitious series of reforms, prying the social fabric of Spain from the centuries-old grip of the Roman Catholic Church. The Socialist government has legalized gay marriage, eased divorce law and expanded the rights of transsexuals.\nNow Mr. Zapatero has ventured onto even more incendiary social terrain, the divide over abortion; and if he was looking for a battle, he found one. As Spain celebrated Holy Week, the clergy rolled out a vigorous protest from pulpits, billboards and the hooded ranks of traditional Easter processions.\nAbortion is technically a crime in Spain, though a law introduced in 1985, 10 years after Franco\u2019s death, permits abortions under certain circumstances. In practice, however, abortions are widely available because doctors cite a mental health exception.\nThe current law allows terminations in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy only in cases of rape and in the first 22 weeks in cases of congenital disorder. However, a woman can abort at any time if her mental or physical health is at risk \u2014 an exception cited in about 97 percent of abortions in Spain, according to Empar Pineda, spokeswoman for the Spanish Association of Accredited Abortion Clinics.\n\u201cOur abortion law is anachronistic,\u201d said Bibiana A\u00eddo, who as minister for equality oversees the rights of women and minorities.\n\u201cIt is the law we were able to pass 23 years ago, but it leaves a lot to be desired,\u201d she said by telephone. \u201cOur society has advanced enormously since then.\u201d\nMs. A\u00eddo said that while Spain boasted equality laws that were among the most progressive in Europe, the country was a laggard when it came to abortion. First trimester abortion is virtually unrestricted in most European countries, though it is still a crime in Ireland. Two years ago, Portugal made it available on request in the first 10 weeks. Italy\u2019s 1978 law permits abortion in a broad range of cases in the first 90 days.\nThe new law in Spain, which the government is in the process of drafting, would make abortion available on request in the first 14 weeks, and it would allow women as young as 16 to seek one without parental consent. Also under the law, a woman could abort in the first 22 weeks in the case of congenital disorder and after that if continuing the pregnancy put her life at risk. The mental health exception would disappear.\nThe church is outraged. In several cities, the Catholic brotherhoods that mark Holy Week with solemn processions have pinned white ribbons and tiny footprints to their robes in protest.\nBishops called on people to resist the reform during sermons on Palm Sunday, according to news reports from several cities.\nCardinal Antonio Ca\u00f1izares Llovera, archbishop of Toledo, said abortion was \u201cagainst man and against the designs of God,\u201d according to a transcript of his sermon on the Toledo Diocese Web site.\n\u201cWe truly cannot give in to this,\u201d he said of the new legislation. \u201cIt is not a question of politics, it is a question of humanity.\u201d\nThe Spanish Episcopal Conference has rented billboards in three dozen cities on which they displayed a protected Iberian lynx next to a crawling baby with the words, \u201cWhat about me? Protect my life.\u201d\nAnti-abortion groups and conservative regional governments have joined the protest. The regional government of Valencia, led by the Popular Party, is preparing an anti-abortion law that would, among other things, promote a network of surrogate families who would take in or support single mothers-to-be.\nThousands of people in Spain and Latin America turned out on March 29 for a protest organized by HazteOir, a conservative advocacy group. The group\u2019s president, Ignacio Arsuaga, said the government should enforce the existing law rather than loosen it.\n\u201cThis government likes to say it defends women\u2019s rights,\u201d he said by telephone. \u201cBut women who abort suffer physically and psychologically.\u201d\nMs. A\u00eddo, the equality minister, said the new abortion law would be \u201cmodern and sensible,\u201d allowing women full legal security in the first 14 weeks and leaving less room for bending of the law further into pregnancy. The new rules would guarantee access to abortions in the public health sector by limiting the scope for doctors to object on the basis of conscience, she said. Currently, 97 percent of abortions are performed by private clinics, which are reimbursed by the state.\nHowever, some women and gynecologists say the proposed law does not resolve the question of late-term abortion.\nA storm erupted in late 2007 over allegations that some clinics were using the mental health clause for late-term abortions of healthy fetuses. The allegations led to the arrest of a gynecologist in Barcelona and raids on two clinics in Madrid. Since then, clinics have virtually halted late-term abortions, said Ms. Pineda, the clinics association spokeswoman, who works at one of the clinics that was raided.\nGemma Botifoll, who decided to terminate her pregnancy after 34 weeks when she discovered her baby had a severe congenital disorder, said she was turned away from clinics in Barcelona, Madrid and Seville. Ms. Botifoll had to drive hundreds of miles to Reims, France, where she had an abortion in a public hospital. The Spanish health system paid for it.\n\u201cThe Spanish doctors told me my son would not live for a year, that he would be blind, that his body would not grow, that he would be mentally disabled,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut they said they could do nothing to help me.\u201d\nCritics say the new law, which would allow a termination after 22 weeks only if the mother\u2019s life was at risk or if the fetus was not viable, would be too restrictive.\n\u201cHow can it be that in Spain we allow transsexuals to get a sex change, that gay people can marry, but we don\u2019t allow a woman to abort a child who has a severe disorder?\u201d Ms. Botifoll asked. \u201cThat I should have to cross a border like a criminal to get a termination \u2014 that\u2019s shameful.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/world/europe/11spain.html", "title": "Spain Steps Into Battle With Itself on Abortion", "author": "VICTORIA BURNETT"}
{"date": "Fri, 24 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 A deadly outburst of violence appears to be overwhelming Iraq\u2019s police and military forces as American troops hand over greater control of cities across the country to them. On Friday, twin suicide bombings killed at least 60 people outside Baghdad\u2019s most revered Shiite shrine, pushing the death toll in one 24-hour period to nearly 150.\nLike many recent attacks, the bombings appeared intended to inflame sectarian tensions, to weaken Iraq\u2019s security forces and to discredit its government.\nThe bombings on Friday ominously echoed attacks like the one at a Shiite shrine in Samarra in February 2006 that unleashed a wave of sectarian bloodshed and pushed the country toward civil war.\nThe latest bombings \u2014 there have been at least 18 major attacks so far this month \u2014 so far have not prompted retaliatory attacks, but they have strained what remains a fragile society deeply divided between Sunnis and Shiites.\nTwo suicide bombers struck within five minutes of each other on streets leading to the shrine of Imam Musa al-Kadhim and his grandson. One of the attacks, and perhaps both, were carried out by women, witnesses said.\nNearly half of those killed were Iranians making a pilgrimage to the shrine, a golden-domed landmark in the predominantly Shiite Kadhimiya neighborhood of Baghdad that is devoted to 2 of the 12 imams of Shiite Islam. At least 125 people were wounded, many of them also Iranians.\nA loose coalition of Sunni militant forces, the Islamic State of Iraq, has claimed responsibility for carrying out many of the recent attacks.\nSeemingly attentive to the public wrath, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki took the unusual step of ordering the creation of a special committee to investigate the attack on Friday and the lapses in security that apparently allowed it to happen. The state television network, Al Iraqiya, reported on Friday evening that Mr. Maliki also ordered the detention of two national police commanders responsible for security in the area.\nThe killing of so many Iranians prompted Iraq to close its border crossing to Iran at Muntheriya in Diyala Province, through which thousands of Iranians a week pass on pilgrimages to Iraq\u2019s holy Shiite sites.\nThe deadliest of the three bombings on Thursday struck a restaurant filled with Iranian travelers in Muqdadiya, a town in Diyala not far from the border. The toll in that attack rose to 56, with Iranians making up the majority of the dead. Over all, at least 89 people were killed in the bombings on Thursday, and more than 100 were wounded.\nAfter the attacks on Friday, angry Iraqis who gathered amid the bloody debris blamed lax security and corruption of the police and government officials for what had happened. Some of their anger had a strongly sectarian cast.\n\u201cThey have been ruling us for 1,400 years,\u201d said a Shiite army soldier who identified himself only as Abu Haidar, referring to the Sunni domination of Shiites in Iraq. \u201cWe took it over for four years, and they are slaughtering us.\u201d\nThe Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella insurgent group that includes Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, describes the recent attacks as part of a campaign called Harvest of the Good, which it announced in March.\nIn a statement distributed on extremist Web sites at the time, the group\u2019s leader, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, ridiculed President Obama as \u201cWashington\u2019s black man\u201d and called his plan to withdraw American forces by 2011 an \u201cimplied avowal of defeat.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Iraq\u2019s military claimed to have arrested Mr. Baghdadi, but what was touted as a major success appeared to be in question.\nExtremist Web sites denied his arrest, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors claims and other statements by terrorist and extremist groups. The American military command also said in a statement that it could not confirm \u201cthe arrest or capture\u201d of the leader, who the American military believes to be a fictitious Iraqi figurehead of a movement that includes many foreign fighters.\nAmerican and Iraqi officials have expressed growing concern that the Islamic State of Iraq, Al Qaeda and other extremists have been able to regroup and exploit gaps in security that are forming as American commanders have closed scores of combat outposts across the country, leaving day-to-day security in the hands of the Iraqis. \u201cAll the killing of Shiites is done by Al Qaeda,\u201d a man who identified himself only as Abu Mohammed said after Friday\u2019s bombings. \u201cAmerica was not able to finish them off. How can our forces do it?\u201d\nA senior national police official on Friday bluntly cited the limitations of Iraq\u2019s security forces and their equipment for detecting explosives, typically hand-held wands used at checkpoints that the official described as fakes.\n\u201cWe need to redeploy our security units to fill gaps because the American withdrawal gave the terrorists motives to reactivate their sleeper cells,\u201d the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he said he would be punished for speaking frankly about such shortcomings. \u201cWe need more cars, modern equipment to detect explosives.\u201d\nMaj. Gen. Abdul-Aziz Mohammed Jasim, a senior commander at the Ministry of Defense, cited other factors behind the recent violence. They included what he called \u201creactions to political issues\u201d that had divided Iraq since provincial elections in January and the release of thousands of detainees held by American forces into a feeble economy.\nAs part of a new security agreement with Iraq that took effect this year, the Americans are required to release all Iraqis in their custody or to transfer them to Iraqi jails. \u201cThey are releasing detainees randomly, and some of the detainees who have been released might still have contact with Al Qaeda,\u201d General Jasim said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd when they return back to their normal life and do not find work, they return back to Al Qaeda.\u201d\nGeneral Jasim also lamented the inability of Iraqi forces to stop attacks against what he described as soft targets, like markets and mosques. \u201cThe security procedures are continuing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the security forces cannot exist in every inch.\u201d\nIt was not clear whether the attacks on Friday were specifically aimed at Iranians or the Shiite site they were visiting. The chief administrator at the shrine, Sheik Fadhil al-Anbari, blamed the police for failing to stop the bombings, which he said were intended to disrupt an economy that the visiting pilgrims had bolstered.\n\u201cThe crowds of the Iranian visitors have brought a boom to the economy in Kadhimiya, and Al Qaeda does not want this,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThese attacks are clearly meant to sabotage the country.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/world/middleeast/25iraq.html", "title": "Storm of Violence in Iraq Strains Its Security Forces", "author": "STEVEN LEE MYERS and SAM DAGHER"}

With this election, Mr. Khamenei and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 appear to have neutralized for now the reform forces that they saw as a threat to their power, political analysts said.\n\u201cThis will change the face of the Islamic Republic forever,\u201d said one well-connected Iranian, who like most of those interviewed declined to be named in the current tense climate. \u201cAhmadinejad will claim an absolute mandate, meaning he has no need to compromise.\u201d\nWhen he was first elected president in 2005, Mr. Ahmadinejad showed his fealty to the leader, gently bending over and kissing his hand.\nOn Saturday, the leader demonstrated his own enthusiasm for the re-elected president, hailing the outcome as \u201ca divine blessing\u201d even before the official three-day challenge period had passed. On Sunday, Mr. Ahmadinejad flaunted his achievement by mounting a celebration rally in the heart of an opposition neighborhood of Tehran, and holding a victory news conference where he scorned the West and made a joke out of his main opponent\u2019s quasi-house arrest.\nCommenting on the Obama administration\u2019s conciliatory overtures, he also suggested that his willingness to reconcile with foreign governments would depend on their willingness to swallow his disputed election.\nAsked about speculation that in his second term he would take a more moderate line, he smirked, \u201cIt\u2019s not true. I\u2019m going to be more and more solid.\u201d\nHe can afford to be. With the backing of the supreme leader and the military establishment, he has marginalized all of the major figures who represented a challenge to the vision of Iran as a permanently revolutionary Islamic state.\nIn many ways, his victory is the latest and perhaps final clash in a battle for power and influence that has lasted decades between Mr. Khamenei and Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former president who, while loyal to the Islamic form of government, wanted a more pragmatic approach to the economy, international relations and social conditions at home.\nMr. Rafsanjani aligned himself and his family closely with the main reform candidate in this race, Mir Hussein Moussavi, a former prime minister who advocated greater freedom \u2014 in particular, greater freedom for women \u2014 and a more conciliatory face to the West. Another former president and pragmatist, Mohammed Khatami, had also thrown in heavily with Mr. Moussavi.\nThe three men, combined with widespread public support and disillusionment with Mr. Ahmadinejad, posed a challenge to the authority of the supreme leader and his allies, political analysts said.\nThe elite Revolutionary Guards and a good part of the intelligence services \u201cfeel very much threatened by the reformist movement,\u201d said a political analyst who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. \u201cThey feel that the reformists will open up to the West and be lenient on the nuclear issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a confrontation of two ways of thinking, the revolutionary and the internationalist. It is a question of power.\u201d\nSince the vote was announced Saturday, Mr. Moussavi has been the hero of seething antigovernment protests in Tehran, but so far they have been contained by legions of riot police officers and hampered by a shutdown of that critical organizing tool, text-messaging. Mr. Moussavi said he was being \u201cclosely monitored\u201d in his home, but hoped to speak at a rally on Monday.\n\u201cHe ran a red light, and he got a traffic ticket,\u201d Mr. Ahmadinejad quipped when asked about his rival.\nUnless the street protests achieve unexpected momentum, the election could cast the pro-reform classes \u2014 especially the better off and better educated \u2014 back into a state of passive disillusionment, some opposition figures said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the middle class is ever going to go out and vote again,\u201d one Moussavi supporter lamented.\nWhen he first caught the West\u2019s attention, Mr. Ahmadinejad had been plucked from an obscure provincial governorship and made mayor of Tehran. There he established himself as a promising populist politician. He refused to use the mayor\u2019s big car or occupy the mayor\u2019s grand office. He didn\u2019t accept his salary.\nFour years ago, the supreme leader anointed him as the fundamentalist presidential alternative to two candidates the leader thought less reliable, Mr. Rafsanjani and Mehdi Karroubi, a former speaker of Parliament. (Mr. Karroubi, a reformist cleric, tried again in this election, and on Friday was humiliated by the announcement that he had come in fifth in a field of four \u2014 after the invalidated ballots.)\nAlthough his first election was marred by allegations of cheating, Mr. Ahmadinejad was credited with being genuinely street smart. He roused crowds with vague attacks on the corruption of the elite, with promises of a vast redistribution of wealth, and with appeals to Iranian pride. By playing to the Muslim world\u2019s feelings of victimization by the West and hatred of Israel, he won adulation on the Arab street even as Arab leaders often disdained him, and that in turn earned him credibility at home.\n\u201cThe old generation of the Islamic Revolution was going to die off,\u201d said one Iranian analyst. \u201cWe thought they would inevitably give way to the reformers. But they found Ahmadinejad, and he was a wise choice. He was a new breed of populist \u2014 a new breed of demagogue.\u201d\nHe is the son of an iron worker, a traffic engineer by education, but political analysts said that he might have been molded most by his experience in the Revolutionary Guards.\nAs president he has presided over a time of rising inflation and unemployment, but has pumped oil revenues into the budget, sustaining a semblance of growth and buying good will among civil servants, the military and the retired.\nMore important, he has consolidated the various arms of power that answer ultimately to the supreme leader. The Revolutionary Guards \u2014 the military elite \u2014 was given license to expand into new areas, including the oil industry and other businesses such as shipbuilding.\nThe Guardian Council, which oversees elections, had its budget increased 15-fold under Mr. Ahmadinejad. The council has presided over not only Friday\u2019s outcome, but over parliamentary majorities loyal to Mr. Ahmadinejad.\nFor a time, it appeared that he was losing the favor of the supreme leader. Under Mr. Ahmadinejad, Iran was hit with sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, inflation and unemployment soared and unrest was rising at home as social restrictions were increased. Two of his own ministers quit, criticizing his management of the state, and Parliament discussed the prospect of impeachment.\nThe president seemed to stumble often. He raised tensions with the West when he told a United NationsGeneral Assembly that he rejected the post-World War II order. He was mocked when he said at Columbia University in 2007 that there was not a single gay person in Iran. In April, nearly two dozen diplomats from the European Union walked out of a conference in Geneva after he disparaged Israel.\nBut political analysts said that back home, the supreme leader approved, seeing confrontation with the West as helpful in keeping alive his revolutionary ideology, and his base of power. President Obama\u2019s conciliatory tone toward Iran, some Iranians believe, threatened to relax Iranian vigilance and the powerful forces to defend it.\nMr. Obama has made clear he still intends to explore an opening to Iran, though the questions of Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s legitimacy and the consolidation of hard-line power could complicate his strategy.\n\u201cThe coming period will not be an easy one,\u201d said Gamal Abdel Gawad, director of the international relations section at the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. \u201cAny change will be slow and difficult because we have an elite that is very much united in its hard-line orientation.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/world/middleeast/15assess.html", "title": "Leader Emerges With Stronger Hand", "author": "BILL KELLER and MICHAEL SLACKMAN"}

He was 82.\nThe cause was lung cancer, said Dr. Alberto Sadler, who had been treating Mr. Alfons\u00edn.\nA passionate voice for human rights, Mr. Alfons\u00edn governed from 1983 to 1989, a time of upheaval that included three failed military coups, hyperinflation and food riots. He won praise for prosecuting the military dictators who had preceded him in office.\nHis government\u2019s inability to manage a sinking economy led him to step down several months before his term was to end, but he remained a respected and influential political figure. When he handed over power to Carlos Sa\u00fal Menem, it was the first time in 61 years that an elected Argentine president had been succeeded by an elected president from a different political party.\n\u201cMy inspiration comes from an ethic, rather than an ideology,\u201d Mr. Alfons\u00edn once said in an interview, \u201can ethic that believes in the freedom of man.\u201d He liked to call himself \u201cthe most humble Argentine,\u201d and his rumpled suits and shabby trench coat became his trademarks.\nRa\u00fal Ricardo Alfons\u00edn Foulkes was born to shopkeepers in Chascom\u00fas in 1927. His father, an immigrant from Spain, was an ardent supporter of the Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War and a foe of Franco. \u201cI came from a home atmosphere where liberty was not only learned from books,\u201d Mr. Alfons\u00edn said.\nHe graduated from a military academy with a bachelor\u2019s degree and the rank of second lieutenant, but he said he \u201cbecame fed up with the military.\u201d He studied law at the National University of La Plata, and while there became active in the centrist Radical Civic Union party, attracted by its populist programs.\nHe held local and provincial offices as political power seesawed between military and civilian authorities after the overthrow and exile of Gen. Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n in 1955. He was elected to the national Parliament in 1963.\nDeveloping a reputation as a maverick, he founded an insurgent faction within the Radical Civic Union. He and his supporters stressed social reforms and hoped that they could loosen the Peronists\u2019 hold over the masses.\nMr. Alfons\u00edn\u2019s political star rose in the late 1970s when he became one of the few politicians to criticize Argentina\u2019s military dictatorships. He helped create a private organization called the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, and he lashed out at the military governments and their paramilitary henchmen, who were responsible for the killing and torture of more than 10,000 dissidents. As a lawyer, he defended many political prisoners.\nThe Argentine military was forced to give up power after the failed invasion of the British-administered Falkland Islands in 1982. A ban on political parties was lifted as a step toward returning the nation to civilian rule. Mr. Alfons\u00edn won the Radical Civic Union\u2019s nomination for president in 1983 and the election.\nHis inauguration ushered in a time of excitement and hope. Mr. Alfons\u00edn\u2019s government successfully prosecuted many of the military leaders who had ruled the country in the 1970s. Similar abuses came to light in Chile, El Salvador and Guatemala. Human rights groups praised him as a beacon of enlightened leadership.\nBut he paid a price for prosecuting officials who still had the power to overthrow him. After one failed rebellion in 1987, Mr. Alfons\u00edn and congressional leaders were forced to enact legislation halting most of the investigations and trials. A de facto amnesty became law, most of the military leaders were eventually freed from prison and Mr. Alfons\u00edn never recovered his political footing.\nOver the next two years he switched economic plans every few months as the currency collapsed, inflation soared and the government fell behind in its debt payments. By the middle of 1989, Mr. Alfons\u00edn decided he had no choice but to step down.\nHe eventually assumed the role of elder statesman in his party, frequently writing opinion articles in the newspapers and granting long, thoughtful interviews on television.\nHe suffered serious injuries in a car accident in June 1999 while campaigning for a political ally.\nHe is survived by his wife, Mar\u00eda Lorenza Barrenechea, and six children.\nMr. Alfons\u00edn made his final public appearance last October, when President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner unveiled a bust of him. \u201cIdeas go on, men don\u2019t go on,\u201d he said. \u201cMen succeed or fail, but it is the ideas that transform themselves into torches that keep democracy alive.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/world/americas/01alfonsin.html", "title": "Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn, 82, Former Argentine Leader, Dies", "author": "CLIFFORD KRAUSS"}
{"date": "Wed, 20 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 Tens of thousands of Irish children were sexually, physically and emotionally abused by nuns, priests and others over 60 years in a network of church-run residential schools meant to care for the poor, the vulnerable and the unwanted, according to a report released in Dublin on Wednesday.\nThe 2,600-page report paints a picture of institutions run more like Dickensian orphanages than 20th-century schools, characterized by privation and cruelty that could be both casual and choreographed.\n\u201cA climate of fear, created by pervasive, excessive and arbitrary punishment, permeated most of the institutions,\u201d the report says. In the boys\u2019 schools, it says, sexual abuse was \u201cendemic.\u201d\nThe report, by a state-appointed commission, took nine years to produce and was meant to help Ireland face and move on from one of the ugliest aspects of its recent history. But it has infuriated many victims\u2019 groups because it does not name any of the hundreds of individuals accused of abuse and thus cannot be used as a basis for prosecutions.\nIt was delayed because of a lawsuit brought by the Christian Brothers, the religious order that ran many of the boys\u2019 schools and that fought, ultimately successfully, to have the abusers\u2019 names omitted. In 2003, the commission\u2019s first chairwoman resigned, saying that Ireland\u2019s Department of Education had refused to release crucial documents. The report covers a period from the 1930s to the 1990s, when the last of the institutions closed.\nIt exposes for the first time the scope of the problem in Ireland, as well as how the government and the church colluded in perpetuating an abusive system. The revelations have also had the effect of stripping the Catholic Church, which once set the agenda in Ireland, of much of its moral authority and political power.\nThe report singles out Ireland\u2019s Department of Education, meant to regulate the schools, for running \u201ctoothless\u201d inspections that overlooked glaring problems and deferred to church authority.\nThe report is based in part on old church records of unreported abuse cases and in part on the anonymous testimony of 1,060 former students from a variety of 216 mostly church-run institutions, including reformatories and so-called industrial schools, set up to tend to neglected, orphaned or abandoned children.\nMost of the former students are now 50 to 80 years old.\nSome 30,000 children were sent to such places over six decades, the report says, often against their families\u2019 wishes and because of pressure from powerful local priests. They were sent because their families could not afford to care for them, because their mothers had committed adultery or given birth out of wedlock, or because one or both of their parents was ill, drunken or abusive. They were also sent because of petty crime, like stealing food, or because they had missed school.\nMany of the former students said that they had not learned their own identities until decades later. They also said that their parents had unsuccessfully tried to reclaim them from the state.\nIn a litany that sounds as if it comes from the records of a P.O.W. camp, the report chronicles some of the forms of physical abuse suffered in the boys\u2019 schools:\n\u201cPunching, flogging, assault and bodily attacks, hitting with the hand, kicking, ear pulling, hair pulling, head shaving, beating on the soles of the feet, burning, scalding, stabbing, severe beatings with or without clothes, being made to kneel and stand in fixed positions for lengthy periods, made to sleep outside overnight, being forced into cold or excessively hot baths and showers, hosed down with cold water before being beaten, beaten while hanging from hooks on the wall, being set upon by dogs, being restrained in order to be beaten, physical assaults by more than one person, and having objects thrown at them.\u201d\nSome of the schools operated essentially as workhouses. In one school, Goldenbridge, girls as young as 7 spent hours a day making rosaries by stringing beads onto lengths of wire. They were given quotas: 600 beads on weekdays and 900 on Sundays.\nGirls were routinely sexually abused, often by more than one person at a time, the report said, in \u201cdormitories, schools, motor vehicles, bathrooms, staff bedrooms, churches, sacristies, fields, parlors, the residences of clergy, holiday locations and while with godparents and employers.\u201d\nThe Vatican had no response. But leaders of various religious orders \u2014 who often argued during the investigations that the abuse was a relic of another time, reflecting past societal standards \u2014 issued abject apologies on Wednesday, taking care to frame the problem as something that is now behind them.\nCardinal Sean Brady, the Catholic primate of All Ireland, said in a statement that he was \u201cprofoundly sorry and deeply ashamed,\u201d adding, \u201cI hope the publication of today\u2019s report will help heal the hurts of victims and address the wrongs of the past.\u201d\nDavid Clohessy, director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, a group based in St. Louis, said that while the report had failed in its duty to bring the perpetrators to justice, it had been clear about the failings of the church.\n\u201cWhile horrific, widespread reports of abuse and cover-up are sadly quite common, the significance here is that a government panel is conclusively saying that the finger-pointing and blame-shifting and excuse-making of the church hierarchy is bogus,\u201d he said in an interview.\nThe commission was formed in 2000, after an explosive series of radio programs and documentaries in the 1990s began exposing a terrible secret that had been kept by an entire society: the details of what went on in the children\u2019s homes. In 1999, Bertie Ahern, then the prime minister, issued a blanket apology to the victims of the abuse.\nSince then, the accusations and the question of justice have been a preoccupation across Ireland and among Irish emigrants around the world. In 2002, the Catholic Church in Ireland agreed to pay $175 million to compensate victims of sexual abuse by members of the clergy. A separate group has paid out some $1.5 billion so far to more than 10,000 people who have claimed they were abused in state and church-run institutions.\nTerence McKiernan, president of BishopAccountability.org, an American group that maintains an Internet archive of material related to Catholic abuse, said that the report had failed by not going far enough.\n\u201cThe report is significant in that it provides a detailed anatomy of how the abuse occurred and the institutions in which it occurred,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe problem is that you spend almost 10 years and who knows how much money, and you never get to the point of saying who was responsible.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/europe/21ireland.html", "title": "Report Details Abuses in Irish Reformatories", "author": "SARAH LYALL"}

{"date": "Fri, 13 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 After a new review of a police shooting that killed a Brazilian man mistakenly identified as a terrorist bomber, the agency that oversees criminal prosecutions said Friday that it would not charge any of the police officers involved.\nThe decision appeared to end years of efforts by the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, a 27-year-old electrician, to have members of Scotland Yard\u2019s counterterrorism squad prosecuted for the actions of two undercover officers who shot Mr. de Menezes seven times in the head after he boarded a subway train in London.\nSeveral government-ordered inquiries and a prolonged inquest in 2008 showed that a series of police errors led to Mr. de Menezes being wrongly identified as a prime suspect in a series of abortive subway bombings on July 21, 2005, two weeks after suicide bombers killed 56 people, including the bombers, on the London transit system.\nDespite the police errors, and wide differences between the police account of the shootings and that given by witnesses on the train, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence that any offense was committed by any individual officers.\u201d\nThe inquest focused on actions of two firearms officers, identified only as \u201cCharlie 2\u201d and \u201cCharlie 12,\u201d who said they had shouted a warning to Mr. de Menezes as he sat in the stationary subway train, identifying themselves as police officers, and that he had advanced toward them.\nBut several witnesses testified at the inquest that they had heard no warning and that Mr. de Menezes had not moved toward the officers. Those discrepancies helped lead to the inquest jury\u2019s decision in December rejecting police claims that Mr. de Menezes had been shot lawfully.\nOn Friday, Stephen O\u2019Doherty, a lawyer who led the review for the prosecution, acknowledged that \u201calthough there were some inconsistencies in what the officers said at the inquest, there were also inconsistencies in what passengers had said.\u201d\n\u201cI concluded that in the confusion of what occurred on the day, a jury could not be sure that any officer had deliberately given a false account of events,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Doherty said.\nIt was not the first time the prosecution service had looked at the evidence and decided not to proceed. Mr. O\u2019Doherty was appointed to review the inquest evidence and see if there were any fresh grounds for actions against the officers.\nAfter the inquest finding, Mr. de Menezes\u2019s family had said they would take legal action challenging the coroner\u2019s ruling that a finding of unlawful killing was not an option. Given the choice of ruling that the killing was lawful or rendering an open verdict, the jury chose the latter. But on Friday the family announced through lawyers that they were dropping that action.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/world/europe/14britain.html", "title": "British Officers in \u201905 Killing in Subway Won\u2019t Be Charged", "author": "JOHN F.

On Thursday, the military\u2019s chief advocate general ordered an investigation into a soldier\u2019s account of a sniper killing a woman and her two children who walked too close to a designated no-go area by mistake, and another account of a sharpshooter who killed an elderly woman who came within 100 yards of a commandeered house.\nWhen asked why that elderly woman was killed, a squad commander was quoted as saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s great about Gaza \u2014 you see a person on a path, he doesn\u2019t have to be armed, you can simply shoot him. In our case it was an old woman on whom I did not see any weapon when I looked. The order was to take down the person, this woman, the minute you see her. There are always warnings, there is always the saying, \u2018Maybe he\u2019s a terrorist.\u2019 What I felt was, there was a lot of thirst for blood.\u201d\nThe testimonies by soldiers, leaked to the newspapers Maariv and Haaretz, appeared in a journal published by a military preparatory course at the Oranim Academic College in the northern town of Tivon. The newspapers promised to release more such anecdotal accounts on Friday, without saying how many.\nThe academy\u2019s director, Dany Zamir, told Israel Radio, \u201cThose were very harsh testimonies about unjustified shooting of civilians and destruction of property that conveyed an atmosphere in which one feels entitled to use unrestricted force against Palestinians.\u201d\nThe revelations caused an immediate uproar here, with some soldiers and reservists saying they did not recognize the stories being told as accurate.\nDefense Minister Ehud Barak told Israel Radio that he believed such incidents to be exceptions, adding, \u201cThe Israeli Army is the most moral in the world, and I know what I\u2019m talking about because I know what took place in the former Yugoslavia, in Iraq.\u201d\nIt was clear that Mr. Zamir felt that his concerns, which he had raised earlier in a letter to the military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, had not been taken seriously and that was why he published the testimonies.\nSince the war ended, others have raised similar questions, generating a heated debate within military circles.\n\u201cAccording to the code, a soldier has to do his utmost to avoid civilian casualties and that involves taking some risk,\u201d said Moshe Halbertal, a Jewish philosophy professor at Hebrew University who, along with three others, rewrote the military ethics code eight years ago. \u201cThat is the question we have to struggle with. From the testimonies of these soldiers, it sounds like they didn\u2019t practice this norm.\u201d\nAmir Marmor, a 33-year-old history graduate student in Jerusalem and a military reservist, said in an interview with The New York Times that he was stunned to discover the way civilian casualties were discussed in training discussions before his tank unit entered Gaza in January. \"Shoot and don\u2019t worry about the consequences,\u201d was the message from the top commanders, he said. Speaking of a lieutenant colonel who briefed the troops, Mr. Marmor said, \u201cHis whole demeanor was extremely gung ho. This is very, very different from my usual experience. I have been doing reserve duty for 12 years, and it was always an issue how to avoid causing civilian injuries. He said in this operation we are not taking any chances. Morality aside, we have to do our job. We will cry about it later.\u201d\nSome 1,300 people were killed in the Gaza war, but how many of them were combatants remains a matter of controversy. Israel lost about 10 soldiers in Gaza, some because of fire by its own forces.\nThe Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights, which has documented the Gaza deaths, says that about two-thirds of the 1,300 were civilians, among them 121 women and 288 children, which it defines as anyone 18 and younger.\nBut the Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Israel said Thursday that it had analyzed the Palestinian center\u2019s names and found that some that it listed as civilians were identified as combatants on Hamas-related Web sites. Some listed as children were 17-year-olds with guns, it said, adding that more than 500 of those described by the center as civilians it considered \u201cunknowns\u201d because most were men of combat age whose activities could not be easily traced.\nIt argued that the proportion of women and children among the dead was relatively low, showing that Israel had not killed in an indiscriminate fashion.\nGur Rosenblat, a company commander during the Gaza operation, said in an interview: \u201cTo say that people were killed without justification \u2014 the opposite was true. We put soldiers at risk to prevent harming their civilians.\u201d\nIsraeli experts noted that Palestinian women had served as suicide bombers in the past so that soldiers in Gaza did not always know when a woman was approaching whether she was a threat.\nOne of the soldiers\u2019 testimonies involved the killing of a family. The soldier said: \u201cWe had taken over the house, and the family was released and told to go right. A mother and two children got confused and went left. The sniper on the roof wasn\u2019t told that this was O.K. and that he shouldn\u2019t shoot. You can say he just did what he was told.\u201d\nMuch of what happened in Gaza, some military experts said, was in reaction to the way events unfolded in the second Lebanon war in 2006 when Hezbollah caused many Israeli casualties.\nIn that war, when Israeli soldiers took over a house, they sometimes found themselves shot at from a house next door. The result was that in Gaza, many houses next to those commandeered by troops were destroyed to avoid that risk.\nStill, Israeli ethicists say they are troubled by what they have heard.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I think that selective use of killing civilians has been very much on the agenda for fighting terror,\u201d said Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist at Hebrew University who has been lecturing at defense colleges. \u201cThe army believes that a weak spot of Israeli deterrence is its strong commitment not to kill civilians, and there has grown the sense that it might have to temporarily overcome that weakness in order to restore deterrence.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/world/middleeast/20gaza.html", "title": "Soldiers\u2019 Accounts of Gaza Killings Raise Furor in Israel", "author": "ETHAN BRONNER"}

Yet despite a sizable Muslim population, this Danish city has nothing but the occasional tiny storefront Muslim place of worship.\nThe city, Denmark\u2019s capital, is now inching toward construction of not one, but two grand mosques. In August, the city council approved the construction of a Shiite Muslim mosque, replete with two 104-foot-tall minarets, in an industrial quarter on the site of a former factory. Plans are also afoot for a Sunni mosque. But it has been a long and complicated process, tangled up in local politics and the publication four years ago of cartoons mocking Islam.\nThe difficulties reflect the tortuous path Denmark has taken in dealing with its immigrants, most of whom are Muslim. Copenhagen in particular has been racked by gang wars, with shootouts and killings in recent months between groups of Hells Angels and immigrant bands.\nThe turmoil has fed the popularity of an anti-immigrant conservative party, the Danish People\u2019s Party. In city elections scheduled for Nov. 17, the People\u2019s Party, by some estimates, could double the roughly 6 percent of the vote it took in the last municipal election.\nDenmark is not alone in grappling with the question. In Italy, the rightist Northern League opposes mosques in Italian cities; in Switzerland, voters will go to the polls on Nov. 29 in a referendum to decide whether to ban the construction of minarets.\nIn Denmark, it was the cartoons, one of which depicted Muhammad with a bomb in his turban, that gave the initial impetus to a movement for a mosque.\n\u201cI wrote a front-page story saying we somehow had to reconnect to the Muslims, to collect money to build a mosque as a sign of solidarity,\u201d said Herbert Pundik, 82, the former editor of the Danish daily Politiken. Mr. Pundik, speaking by phone from Tel Aviv, where he now lives, said that within 24 hours there had been more than 1,000 positive responses. But then the Muslim reaction to the cartoons turned violent, with attacks on Danish embassies in several cities, including Beirut and Damascus.\n\u201cThe steam went out of the project,\u201d Mr. Pundik said.\nYet it did not die. Bijan Eskandani, the architect of the Shiite mosque, said he found inspiration for his design in the \u201cPersian element in Islamic art,\u201d which he said consisted of a \u201cspecial lyric, poetic attitude.\u201d The Shiite community, he said in written answers to questions, lacked the financial means to acquire a suitable site for a mosque. \u201cThe building lot they have is situated in an ugly, unattractive, inharmonious gray factory area,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201ca sparkling mosque there may make a difference.\u201d\nThe very word Persian sends chills down Martin Henriksen\u2019s spine. \u201cWe are against the mosque,\u201d said Mr. Henriksen, 29, one of the People\u2019s Party\u2019s five-member directorate, in an interview in Copenhagen\u2019s Parliament building. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to everyone that the Iranian regime has something to do with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Iranian regime is based on a fascist identity that we don\u2019t want to set foot in Denmark.\u201d\nSince becoming party to the national government coalition in 2001, the People\u2019s Party has helped enact legislation to stem the flow of immigrants and raise the bar for obtaining citizenship. Immigrants, Mr. Henriksen insists, \u201cneed to show an ability and a will to become Danes.\u201d He cites past Jewish immigration as an example. \u201cMany Jews have come to Denmark since the 16th century,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have discussions about whether to build synagogues.\u201d There are at least four synagogues in the city.\nAbdul Wahid Pedersen, whose parents are Scandinavian, converted to Islam years ago. \u201cI was 28, a child of the 60s,\u201d he said. Now 55, he is chairman of a 15-member committee promoting construction of a grand mosque for Copenhagen\u2019s Sunni Muslims.\nHe concedes that of the estimated 250,000 Muslims in a Danish population of 5.5 million, only about 35,000 are Sunnis. Yet he defends the need for a grand mosque and says that while the Sunni community is not soliciting financing from Saudi Arabia, as the People\u2019s Party contends, he has no problem accepting a donation. \u201cIf someone wants to chip in, that is O.K.,\u201d he said, in the shop in a working-class neighborhood where he sells Islamic literature, prayer rugs and other religious objects. \u201cBut they will have no influence on running the place.\u201d Mr. Pedersen said his committee was even considering installing wind turbines atop the minarets and covering the mosque\u2019s dome with one large solar panel.\nThe city\u2019s deputy mayor, Klaus Bondam, 45, defends the right of Muslims to their mosques. The minarets, he said, would be \u201cquite slim towers, we\u2019re not going to be Damascus or Cairo.\u201d The city had also made clear there would be no calling to prayers from the mosques\u2019 minarets. As to the charge of foreign underwriting, Mr. Bondam said it did not concern him as long as the sources were listed openly.\nBut he said he feared that the debate over the mosques could help the People\u2019s Party double its share of the vote in this month\u2019s local elections to as much as 12 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s the little discomfit of people of other religion or background,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they be like me?\u201d\nFor Toger Seidenfaden, 52, the present editor of Politiken, the People\u2019s Party is \u201cdemocratic and parliamentary \u2014 they are not brownshirts.\u201d But he said they were a \u201cvery Danish, nationalist party \u2014 they\u2019d like Denmark before globalization.\u201d\nOn the broad avenue called Njalsgade, where the Sunni mosque is to be built on a vacant lot, Preben Anderson, 61, a bricklayer, said he had nothing against a mosque, though he pointedly said that he could not speak for his neighbors. \u201cWe have churches,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have mosques.\u201d He stood across the street from where weeds and junk now cover the lot where the Sunni mosque could one day stand. One neighborhood resident, asked if he could point out the site where the mosque would be built, professed not to know.\nYet, Per Nielsen, 56, a retired history teacher, said the economic slowdown and the gang wars in nearby neighborhoods were feeding the popularity of the People\u2019s Party. As for the mosque, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s very strong pressure \u2014 people living here don\u2019t want it.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/world/europe/12copenhagen.html", "title": "Push to Build Mosques Is Met With Resistance", "author": "JOHN TAGLIABUE"}
{"date": "Tue, 21 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014Efforts to break the political stalemate that has polarized Honduras failed again late Tuesday night as leaders of the de facto government rejected a proposal by the head of their own negotiating team to allow the ousted president, Manuel Zelaya, to return to power.\nUnder the plan, drafted by Carlos L\u00f3pez Contreras, who serves as foreign minister in the de facto government, the presidential election would be moved up one month, to October, and Mr. Zelaya would be barred from trying to change the Constitution to allow him to run for a second term. He also could not be prosecuted for at least six months for crimes that were cited when troops detained him in his home June 28 and then loaded him on a plane out of the country.\nBut that limited period of amnesty, according to sources close to the acting president, Roberto Micheletti, was rejected by members of the country\u2019s Supreme Court.\nA copy of the proposal was provided to The New York Times by United States Congressional aides.\nOpponents to President Zelaya charge that he tried to change the Constitution in order to extend his time in office, a move that they said was illegal and that led to his ouster. Those opponents have said that Mr. Zelaya should be allowed back into Honduras only if he agrees to face prosecution for that conduct.\nMr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s reconciliation plan followed talks with diplomats from Costa Rica, whose president, \u00d3scar Arias, has been mediating the dispute. But it was not presented to Mr. Micheletti and members of the Honduran government until late Tuesday night.\nThe plan would for at least six months have prohibited all political prosecutions involving people on both sides of the coup and provided for the formation of a truth commission to investigate the acts that led to Mr. Zelaya\u2019s removal.\nEarly in the day officials hailed the proposal as the first sign that at least some leaders in Mr. Micheletti\u2019s camp were willing to accept Mr. Zelaya back as president. But the rejection Tuesday night made it clear that after two rounds of talks, Mr. Micheletti \u2014 along with members of the Supreme Court, the Congress and the business community \u2014 had hardly moved at all and that prospects for a negotiated solution remained slim.\nIndeed on Tuesday, Mr. Micheletti\u2019s position seemed only to harden further. The Associated Press reported that his government ordered Venezuelan diplomats out of the country, accusing them of interfering in Honduran affairs. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, a staunch critic of United States policy in Latin America, has been one of President Zelaya\u2019s most outspoken supporters.\nIn Washington, Mr. Zelaya\u2019s ties to President Ch\u00e1vez, who is accused by critics of undermining democratic institutions in his own country, have set off a fierce debate on Capitol Hill, where conservative Republicans view Mr. Zelaya as more of a threat to democracy than those responsible for his ouster. Meanwhile, Democrats want Mr. Zelaya to be returned to power.\nThe proposal being considered Tuesday night was the first sign \u2014 though hardly a clear one \u2014 that Mr. Micheletti\u2019s position may be softening under mounting international pressure. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called Mr. Micheletti on Sunday night, and the European Union announced on Monday that it had suspended about $90 million in aid.\nIn addition to calling for Mr. Zelaya\u2019s return as president, the proposal would also establish a \u201cverification commission,\u201d made up of monitors from the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the European Union to make sure that parties on both sides complied with the terms of the agreement.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/world/americas/22honduras.html", "title": "Compromise Rejected in Honduran Coup", "author": "GINGER THOMPSON"}

He was 94.\nHis death was announced by Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.\nMr. Yang, who was given a lifetime achievement award in September by the Translators\u2019 Association of China, was widely regarded as the greatest translator of 20th-century China. Working for the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing and later for his own company, Panda Books, he translated scores of major Chinese works, written from the 10th century to the present, into English, usually in collaboration with his wife, Gladys, who died in 1999. He also translated works by George Bernard Shaw and other English-language writers into Chinese.\nYang Xianyi was born on Jan. 10, 1915, into a banking family in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin. After studying at a missionary school, he enrolled at Merton College, Oxford, in 1934 to study classical languages and literature. Three years later he met Gladys Margaret Taylor, the Beijing-born daughter of a British missionary, who was studying French literature at Oxford and later became the first person to obtain a degree in Chinese literature there.\nThe couple began working together as translators and, despite opposition from their families, married in China in 1940.\nMr. Yang said he considered his most important accomplishment to be the translation of \u201cA Dream of Red Mansions,\u201d an 18th-century novel viewed by many scholars as the greatest Chinese literary work in history. He and his wife began working on that translation in the early 1960s and finished it in 1974. When asked to help translate the selected works of Mao Zedong, he declined, citing work on \u201cA Dream of Red Mansions\u201d as his priority.\nViewed with some suspicion by the government because of his outspokenness and his family background, Mr. Yang, who belonged to the Communist Party, was imprisoned from 1968 to 1972 on charges of being a British spy. His wife spent those years in a separate prison, denied contact with him. The couple\u2019s only son, Yang Ye, also a victim of political persecution, committed suicide.\nThe Chinese government eventually apologized for the arrests, and Mr. Yang remained a loyal Communist, although he was expelled from the party in 1989 after criticizing the government\u2019s crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square.\nHis autobiography, \u201cWhite Tiger,\u201d was published in 2000.\nMr. Yang is survived by two daughters, Yang Ying and Yang Zhi, and four grandchildren.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/world/asia/28yang.html", "title": "Yang Xianyi, Translator of Chinese Works, Dies at 94", "author": "THE NEW YORK TIMES"}
{"date": "Sat, 05 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MCHINJI DISTRICT, Malawi \u2014 The Home of Hope orphanage provides Chikodano Lupanga, 15, with three nutritious meals a day, new school uniforms, sensible black shoes and a decent education.\nHer orphaned cousin Jean, 11, who balked at entering the orphanage and lives with her grown sister, has no shoes, raggedy clothes and an often-empty belly. Repeating third grade for the third time, Jean said she bitterly regretted that she did not grow up in the orphanage where Madonna adopted a boy. Had she stayed, she whispered, \u201cI would have learned to read.\u201d\nIn a country as desperately poor as Malawi, children placed in institutions are often seen as the lucky ones. But even as orphanages have sprung up across Africa with donations from Western churches and charities, the families who care for the vast majority of the continent\u2019s orphans have gotten no help at all, household surveys show.\nResearchers now say a far better way to assist these bereft children is with simple allocations of cash \u2014 $4 to $20 a month in an experimental program under way here in Malawi \u2014 given directly to the destitute extended families who take them in. That program could provide grants to eight families looking after some two dozen children for the $1,500 a year it costs to sponsor one child at the Home of Hope, estimated Candace M. Miller, a Boston University professor and a lead researcher in the project.\nExperts and child advocates maintain that orphanages are expensive and often harm children\u2019s development by separating them from their families. Most of the children living in institutions around the world have a surviving parent or close relative, and they most commonly entered orphanages because of poverty, according to new reports by Unicef and Save the Children.\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s money in orphanages, people are creating them and getting children in them,\u201d said Dr. Biziwick Mwale, executive director of Malawi\u2019s National AIDS Commission.\nThe Home of Hope\u2019s founder, the Rev. Thomson Chipeta, 80, said children needed the orphanage because their families were so poor. \u201cIf the children can be given the privilege of a home like this one, it\u2019s much better,\u201d he said.\nMadonna\u2019s charity, Raising Malawi, pays for most of Home of Hope\u2019s operating budget and also supports community centers where orphans who remain with their families can go for food and services, said the charity\u2019s executive director, Philippe van den Bossche. He said orphanages were not the best solution but were needed when families could not or would not care for children.\nIn Madonna\u2019s video on AIDS orphans in Malawi, \u201cI Am Because We Are,\u201d she says she was drawn to the country when she was told such children \u201cwere everywhere, living on the streets, sleeping under bridges, hiding in abandoned buildings, being abducted, kidnapped, raped.\u201d\nBut across Africa, demographic data shows that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died. And while AIDS has worsened the orphan crisis in Africa, the United Nations recently estimated that of 55.3 million children in sub-Saharan Africa who have lost at least one parent, AIDS accounted for 14.7 million of them.\nThe Joint Learning Initiative on Children and H.I.V./AIDS, which brought together dozens of international experts to review hundreds of studies, this year strongly endorsed programs that give the poorest families modest financial support, including cash transfer programs like Malawi\u2019s.\nMore than a billion dollars in foreign aid has been spent over the past five years for orphans and vulnerable children, but some major donors cannot break down how their contributions were spent. Researchers say donors need to weed out ineffective, misconceived programs, scrutinizing those that are managed by international nongovernmental organizations or governments but reliant on volunteers in villages to do the work.\n\u201cAn enormous amount of money is going into these efforts with very little return,\u201d said Linda Richter, who runs the children\u2019s programs at South Africa\u2019s Human Sciences Research Council.\nHere in Malawi, hundreds of community groups have won small grants to start small labor-intensive businesses and are expected to donate all the profits to orphans. Pauline Peters, a Harvard University anthropologist, and Susan Watkins, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who have independently done years of field work in Malawian villages, say orphans have received few benefits from the millions spent.\n\u201cThe donors have fantasies of the way things work \u2014 that you can mobilize villagers to care for children who aren\u2019t theirs without paying them to do it,\u201d Professor Watkins said.\nIn Kandikiti, where Jean Lupanga\u2019s family lives, a group of 20 villagers won a $4,000 grant last year to start a pig farm to help orphans. The group bought nine pure-bred hogs, built them a residence nicer than those of most people and posted volunteers to guard it round the clock. They also bought 10 bicycles, vaccines for the pigs and paid their members to attend training sessions.\nMore than a year later, they have not sold a single one of the white, floppy-eared, European-bred pigs. In a village where scruffy local pigs trot freely among the huts, the group\u2019s leader fell silent when asked who could afford such expensive pork.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d said Selina Sakala, 47, chairwoman of Mmasomuyere Orphan Care.\nMalawi\u2019s cash transfer experiment, financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and supported by Unicef, directly helps destitute families who care for many children or have no able-bodied adult to earn a living. Children whose families got the grants were healthier, better fed and clothed and more likely to be in school than children in families that got none, according to a randomized community trial conducted by Boston University and the University of Malawi and paid for by Unicef and the United States government.\nProfessor Miller said the program had yielded \u201cfabulous benefits\u201d but cautioned that the country needed better safeguards to prevent corruption and fraud in the future.\nThrongs of Malawians gathered one recent day under shade trees to collect the cash. Many grandparents had walked miles on bare feet as cracked and parched as the earth. Officials in plastic chairs checked photo identity cards. Recipients unable to read or write left an inky thumb print, then twisted the precious bills into the hem of a skirt or tucked them in a pocket.\nFamilies who have been collecting the grants for a year or two say they have made a difference. Velenasi Jackson spends the $20 she gets each month on staple foods and clothes for the 10 orphaned grandchildren who share her two-room mud hut in the village of Nyoka. They no longer go whole days with nothing to eat, she said.\n\u201cA gift is never too small,\u201d she said.\nHere in the Mchinji District, the Home of Hope looks after 653 children, from infants to teenagers. Its founder, Mr. Chipeta, leaning on a hand-carved wooden staff, gestured to each building on a tour of the grounds and proudly named the donor who paid for it. Among them were churches and individuals from the United States, Canada, Britain, the Netherlands, South Korea and Germany.\nIn a letter Mr. Chipeta gives visitors, he says the home needs their prayers, love and support \u2014 with the phrase \u201cSee Our Budget\u201d in parentheses.\nChikodano Lupanga has lived at the home since she was 6. Her house mother, Enelesi Chiduka, 59, said she was responsible for looking after 80 girls, making sure they showered twice a day, attended daily prayer sessions and did their chores.\nQuiet and serious, Chikodano said her family could never have afforded to send her to high school or to give her a diet that included chicken and fish. \u201cI have lots of friends, and the other needs not met at home are met here \u2014 school fees, clothes, shoes,\u201d she said.\nNine years ago, Chikodano\u2019s cousin Alice, now 31, took her and Jean to the Home of Hope. Chikodano went quietly, but Jean, only 2 or 3 years old and deeply attached to her big sister Alice, sobbed inconsolably and remained with Alice. The family has recently started getting the monthly cash grant, but it is too soon for it to have made much impact.\nJean, a shy, expressive girl with a heart-shaped face, lives the arduous life common to poor rural children across Africa. She fetches water, pounds maize and cooks over smoky fires. At last glance, she was scrubbing Alice\u2019s little boy with soapy well water sloshed from a plastic bucket.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/africa/06orphans.html", "title": "Aid Gives Alternative to African Orphanages", "author": "CELIA W.

Even friends and neighbors of Sudan, like China, Uganda and Libya, which support a deferral of the court\u2019s indictment, expressed concern about the impact of the expulsions.\nMr. Khalikov sketched a grim portrait of what was happening on the ground. Although the government expelled only 13 of scores of foreign agencies operating in Darfur, he said those provided about half of the distribution and provision of aid.\nOver the past two weeks, one United Nations peacekeeper was killed and three were wounded in three separate attacks, he said. There have been meningitis outbreaks, as well. The expulsions ended a mass immunization campaign.\nThe United Nations is also troubled by the Sudanese government\u2019s seizing assets from aid groups, Mr. Khalikov said.\nSusan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations, delivered one of the most barbed speeches, holding Mr. Bashir responsible for the fate of all the people in Darfur. \u201cPresident Bashir created this crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cHe should rectify it immediately.\u201d\nShe noted that the United States had donated about $4 billion in aid to Sudan and eastern Chad since 2004, including $1.25 billion in the current fiscal year, and that it would continue working with the United Nations and remaining agencies to deliver humanitarian assistance.\nThe two Sudanese representatives who spoke objected to the singling out of Mr. Bashir, saying that the expulsion was a government decision and that it was irreversible. One accused the West of creating a crisis over the aid groups in order to deflect attention from the real problem, which they said was the indictment.\nThe meeting on Friday was unexpected, prompted by the United States as a means to keep the spotlight on the crisis, diplomats said. Ms. Rice told reporters that the United States felt it was necessary because there had not been an open meeting on the subject in the two weeks since the expulsions.\nThe Security Council has failed to reach an agreement on what to do about the confrontation with Sudan, and no concrete proposals came out of the Friday meeting.\nAn even wider discussion is expected next week after John Holmes, under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator at the United Nations, reports on a more thorough assessment of the aid situation being carried out in coordination with Sudan\u2019s government.\nThe court\u2019s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, appeared at the microphones outside the Council chamber to suggest that the easiest solution to the problem was for Sudan itself to act.\n\u201cThe Sudan has to find the way to arrest Bashir and stop the crimes; that is the best way,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/21/world/africa/21nations.html", "title": "U.N.

But it was announced in Moscow, just as Russia promised Kyrgyzstan $2.15 billion in aid, and American officials concluded that Russia had encouraged the move.\nThough Washington scrambled to dissuade Kyrgyz officials, the national security chief, Adakhan Madumarov, said Friday, \u201cThe fate of the air base is sealed.\u201d\nCompeting interests shape Russian policy on Afghanistan. The Kremlin is eager to ensure stability in the region out of fear that the heroin trade and Islamic extremism could spread across its borders. But many Russians also feel deep frustration at the presence of the United States military in former Soviet republics.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/world/europe/07russia.html", "title": "U.S. Can Ship Afghan Aid Through Russia, Kremlin Says", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}

{"date": "Tue, 03 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Despite major bombings that have rattled the nation, and fears of rising violence as American troops withdraw, Iraq\u2019s security forces have been relying on a device to detect bombs and weapons that the United States military and technical experts say is useless.\nThe small hand-held wand, with a telescopic antenna on a swivel, is being used at hundreds of checkpoints in Iraq. But the device works \u201con the same principle as a Ouija board\u201d \u2014 the power of suggestion \u2014 said a retired United States Air Force officer, Lt. Col. Hal Bidlack, who described the wand as nothing more than an explosives divining rod.\nStill, the Iraqi government has purchased more than 1,500 of the devices, known as the ADE 651, at costs from $16,500 to $60,000 each. Nearly every police checkpoint, and many Iraqi military checkpoints, have one of the devices, which are now normally used in place of physical inspections of vehicles.\nWith violence dropping in the past two years, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has taken down blast walls along dozens of streets, and he contends that Iraqis will safeguard the nation as American troops leave.\nBut the recent bombings of government buildings here have underscored how precarious Iraq remains, especially with the coming parliamentary elections and the violence expected to accompany them.\nThe suicide bombers who managed to get two tons of explosives into downtown Baghdad on Oct. 25, killing 155 people and destroying three ministries, had to pass at least one checkpoint where the ADE 651 is typically deployed, judging from surveillance videos released by Baghdad\u2019s provincial governor. The American military does not use the devices. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a magic wand that can detect explosives,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Richard J. Rowe Jr., who oversees Iraqi police training for the American military. \u201cIf there was, we would all be using it. I have no confidence that these work.\u201d\nThe Iraqis, however, believe passionately in them. \u201cWhether it\u2019s magic or scientific, what I care about is it detects bombs,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Jehad al-Jabiri, head of the Ministry of the Interior\u2019s General Directorate for Combating Explosives.\nDale Murray, head of the National Explosive Engineering Sciences Security Center at Sandia Labs, which does testing for the Department of Defense, said the center had \u201ctested several devices in this category, and none have ever performed better than random chance.\u201d\nThe Justice Department has warned against buying a variety of products that claim to detect explosives at a distance with a portable device. Normal remote explosives detection machinery, often employed in airports, weighs tons and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. The ADE 651\u2019s clients are mostly in developing countries; no major country\u2019s military or police force is a customer, according to the manufacturer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about Sandia or the Department of Justice or any of them,\u201d General Jabiri said. \u201cI know more about this issue than the Americans do. In fact, I know more about bombs than anyone in the world.\u201d\nHe attributed the decrease in bombings in Baghdad since 2007 to the use of the wands at checkpoints. American military officials credit the surge in American forces, as well as the Awakening movement, in which Iraqi insurgents turned against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, for the decrease.\nAqeel al-Turaihi, the inspector general for the Ministry of the Interior, reported that the ministry bought 800 of the devices from a company called ATSC (UK) Ltd. for $32 million in 2008, and an unspecified larger quantity for $53 million. Mr. Turaihi said Iraqi officials paid up to $60,000 apiece, when the wands could be purchased for as little as $18,500. He said he had begun an investigation into the no-bid contracts with ATSC.\nJim McCormick, the head of ATSC, based in London, did not return calls for comment.\nThe Baghdad Operations Command announced Tuesday that it had purchased an additional 100 detection devices, but General Rowe said five to eight bomb-sniffing dogs could be purchased for $60,000, with provable results.\nChecking cars with dogs, however, is a slow process, whereas the wands take only a few seconds per vehicle. \u201cCan you imagine dogs at all 400 checkpoints in Baghdad?\u201d General Jabiri said. \u201cThe city would be a zoo.\u201d\nSpeed is not the only issue. Colonel Bidlack said, \u201cWhen they say they are selling you something that will save your son or daughter on a patrol, they\u2019ve crossed an insupportable line into moral depravity.\u201d\nLast year, the James Randi Educational Foundation, an organization seeking to debunk claims of the paranormal, publicly offered ATSC $1 million if it could pass a scientific test proving that the device could detect explosives. Mr. Randi said no one from the company had taken up the offer.\nATSC\u2019s promotional material claims that its device can find guns, ammunition, drugs, truffles, human bodies and even contraband ivory at distances up to a kilometer, underground, through walls, underwater or even from airplanes three miles high. The device works on \u201celectrostatic magnetic ion attraction,\u201d ATSC says.\nTo detect materials, the operator puts an array of plastic-coated cardboard cards with bar codes into a holder connected to the wand by a cable. \u201cIt would be laughable,\u201d Colonel Bidlack said, \u201cexcept someone down the street from you is counting on this to keep bombs off the streets.\u201d\nProponents of the wand often argue that errors stem from the human operator, who they say must be rested, with a steady pulse and body temperature, before using the device.\nThen the operator must walk in place a few moments to \u201ccharge\u201d the device, since it has no battery or other power source, and walk with the wand at right angles to the body. If there are explosives or drugs to the operator\u2019s left, the wand is supposed to swivel to the operator\u2019s left and point at them.\nIf, as often happens, no explosives or weapons are found, the police may blame a false positive on other things found in the car, like perfume, air fresheners or gold fillings in the driver\u2019s teeth.\nOn Tuesday, a guard and a driver for The New York Times, both licensed to carry firearms, drove through nine police checkpoints that were using the device. None of the checkpoint guards detected the two AK-47 rifles and ammunition inside the vehicle.\nDuring an interview on Tuesday, General Jabiri challenged a Times reporter to test the ADE 651, placing a grenade and a machine pistol in plain view in his office. Despite two attempts, the wand did not detect the weapons when used by the reporter but did so each time it was used by a policeman.\n\u201cYou need more training,\u201d the general said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/middleeast/04sensors.html", "title": "Iraq Swears by Bomb Detector U.S. Sees as Useless", "author": "ROD NORDLAND"}
{"date": "Fri, 18 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 A sweeping Supreme Court decision that reopened corruption cases against thousands of politicians, including President Asif Ali Zardari, reverberated through the government on Friday as important ministers were barred from leaving the country and ordered to appear before the courts in the coming weeks.\nAmong those immediately affected were the interior minister, Rehman Malik, who is considered particularly close to the United States, and the defense minister, Ahmad Mukhtar, raising concerns about how effectively the Zardari government, under pressure from a violent Islamic insurgency, could continue to function.\nThe two men were among 247 officials, also including Salman Faruqui, the chief of staff to Mr. Zardari, placed on what is known as an exit control list. It bars them from leaving Pakistan, a measure Pakistani authorities often use to ensure that those under criminal investigation do not abscond.\nAt least 52 politicians were called to appear before corruption courts, according to the National Accountability Bureau, the anticorruption unit that was ordered by the Supreme Court on Wednesday to act expeditiously in reopening the cases.\nBy the end of the day on Friday, Mr. Faruqui had won an interim bail order from the Sindh High Court, a measure that would prevent him from being arrested, legal experts said.\nMr. Malik had also been ordered to appear before the Sindh High Court, according to Pakistan\u2019s Express News television channel. Attempts to reach a spokesman for Mr. Malik were unsuccessful.\nPresident Zardari has immunity from prosecution under the Constitution. He remained defiant on Friday against calls from the main opposition party that he step down.\nMoreover, he has no intention of asking cabinet ministers or colleagues facing corruption charges to quit, a media adviser, Farahnaz Ispahani, said Friday.\n\u201cThe president is fighting fit,\u201d Ms. Ispahani said. \u201cThe president was clear that our Pakistan Peoples Party ministers would not be asked to resign merely on the basis of accusation.\u201d\nA cabinet reshuffle in which \u201csome people will be out and some will be moved\u201d will be the main response to the revocation of the amnesty by the Supreme Court, Ms. Ispahani said.\nBut as Mr. Zardari and his party, the Pakistan Peoples Party, the biggest in Pakistan, battled to survive, a groundswell of media and public opinion seemed to exult in the Supreme Court decision.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen the mighty in this country held accountable,\u201d said Babar Sattar, a Harvard-trained constitutional lawyer.\nNow that the court, backed by public opinion, has come down hard on corruption in a way not seen before in Pakistan, the affected politicians are not sure how to react, Mr. Sattar said.\nThe confused response was evident when Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani dismissed the interior secretary, Qamar-uz Zaman Chaudhry, and three officials of the Federal Investigation Agency on Friday evening for barring Mr. Mukhtar, the defense minister, from traveling abroad on Thursday.\nThe incident was an embarrassment to the governing Pakistan Peoples Party and the defense minister, who was leaving for China on an official visit and called the move \u201cshameful.\u201d\nA statement released by the prime minister\u2019s office stated that the officials had not verified whether the minister\u2019s name was on the exit control list and that their actions had \u201cbrought a bad name to the country.\u201d\nThere was no sign on Friday that the army, which has been increasingly at odds with Mr. Zardari, was aiming to take control. But it has grown more wary of Mr. Zardari as an aura of corruption has continued to mount around his government.\nThe reputation of the army, stained after the president and military chief at the time, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, imposed emergency rule in November 2007, has grown in the past few months as it has fought Taliban militants, and it will benefit further because of the severity of the Supreme Court decision against the civilian government, analysts said.\nMany of the corruption cases that the Supreme Court said must be reopened originate from the 1990s, including cases against Mr. Zardari, who served 11 years in prison. Mr. Zardari contends he was never convicted of corruption, a signal that he and his supporters say shows his innocence.\nLawyers affiliated with the opposition party the Pakistan Muslim League and some legal experts dispute Mr. Zardari\u2019s assertion, citing a conviction in Switzerland that Mr. Zardari appealed. That case was withdrawn by the Pakistani government in 2007 under the provisions of the amnesty against corruption cases imposed by General Musharraf, who later resigned his military post.\nIn its ruling on Wednesday, the Supreme Court said the Musharraf government had acted improperly in withdrawing the case in Switzerland. It asked the Swiss authorities to resume the proceedings. Swiss officials backed away from the Supreme Court\u2019s demand, saying Thursday that the case would not be reopened unless Pakistan started proceedings against Mr. Zardari.\nIn tackling the issue of corruption, the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who likes to see himself as the \u201cpeople\u2019s judge,\u201d has gone beyond rolling back the amnesty on individual corruption cases.\nThis week, the court also took exception to the government\u2019s removing the chief of the country\u2019s main investigative agency.\nIn a ruling separate from the lifting of the amnesty, the court ordered the government to reinstate the head of the Federal Investigation Agency, Tariq Khosa, who had been dismissed by Prime Minister Gilani.\nMr. Khosa, who was described in the Pakistani press as the country\u2019s toughest corruption fighter, was removed from his job earlier this month in the midst of an investigation.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/19/world/asia/19pstan.html", "title": "Pakistan Ministers Are Called Before the Courts", "author": "JANE PERLEZ and SALMAN MASOOD"}

{"date": "Fri, 01 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton insists her transition from presidential contender to secretary of state has been seamless, and in one respect, it is hard to argue with her: she still hustles like a candidate down a few points in the polls the week before Super Tuesday.\nBut in many other ways, Mrs. Clinton has shed her candidate\u2019s skin. Her campaign staff is largely gone, replaced by a broader circle of advisers. Her husband, who stood behind her at countless campaign stops this time last year, has resumed his globe-trotting life, seeing her on rare weekends at their home in Chappaqua, N.Y.\nIn this, the latest mutation in a career of many changes, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s days have become a whirl of diplomatic talks, White House meetings and foreign travel: 74,000 miles and 22 countries as of last Sunday, when she returned from Iraq and Lebanon.\nBy all accounts, Mrs. Clinton has worked hard to be a good soldier in an administration run by the man she spent much of last year trying to defeat. She and President Obama have developed a respectful rapport, several officials said, and she has emerged as an influential voice in the great policy debates of the day, notably Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nBut State Department officials, and others in the administration, say less-than-generous things about Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, suggesting there is some jockeying among the top officials around the president. General Jones, these people say, has struggled with his transition from Marine commander to senior staff person, speaking up less in debates than Mrs. Clinton and not pushing as hard for decisions.\nFriends acknowledge that Mrs. Clinton herself was initially swamped by the challenge of taking over the sprawling State Department bureaucracy \u2014 management being one deficit in her career. She likens it to being \u201cmayor of a good-sized small city.\u201d\nBut Mrs. Clinton has turned a corner in recent weeks, these people say, both as a manager and as a diplomat. Her stern public warnings about the recent Taliban offensive in Pakistan put her on center stage as the messenger of American unease.\n\u201cI love the job; I mean, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in a recent interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve inherited so many problems.\u201d\nAs a former first lady, senator, and presidential candidate, Mrs. Clinton enjoys rarefied status, even for a secretary of state. She has not hesitated to put this to use, whether in rock-star-like appearances in South Korea and Turkey, or in positioning herself at home.\nEven before she was confirmed, Mrs. Clinton summoned Richard C. Holbrooke, now the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, for a fireside chat at her Washington home with Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander who oversees the region.\nIn an unusual arrangement, Mrs. Clinton is protected by both the State Department\u2019s diplomatic security and by the Secret Service, which has protected the Clintons since 1992. As a candidate, Mrs. Clinton was criticized for poor management of her campaign. She appears determined not to repeat her mistakes. Mrs. Clinton said she had sought fresh voices; mindful that previous secretaries of state have been criticized for cloistering themselves on the building\u2019s seventh floor, she has made a point of dropping in at its bureaus.\nFew of her campaign officials were offered posts, though Mrs. Clinton has brought over aides from the Senate and from her years as first lady. She has also drawn on veterans of the Clinton inner circle, like Cheryl Mills, who is her chief of staff.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody in politics who doesn\u2019t have a group of people,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. But she added, \u201cA lot of people who I hired, I never worked with, and have just taken on faith and reputation.\u201d\nThere are other vestiges of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political life: her Senate campaign committee remains in existence and will hold on to a list of donors to her presidential campaign, a tantalizing clue that she contemplates a use for them in the future.\nMrs. Clinton tries to get to New York once or twice a month, she said, but it has been hard because of her foreign travel. But she said she talks to Mr. Clinton regularly, and exchanges e-mail messages with her daughter, Chelsea, on her BlackBerry, which she is not allowed to use, for security reasons, at work.\nMrs. Clinton turned to her husband, the former president, in planning a recent trip to Haiti because he had been there two weeks earlier. But she said Mr. Clinton had also weighed in with advice to General Jones or Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. \u201cHe\u2019s always value-added,\u201d she said.\nThese days, Mrs. Clinton has a regular Thursday afternoon meeting with the current president. People who have been in meetings with them say their relationship is comfortable, if not warm.\nOn a recent afternoon, at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s suggestion, the two moved their meeting outside to a picnic table on the South Lawn, next to a new swing set installed for Mr. Obama\u2019s daughters. \u201cWe just had the best time,\u201d she said.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s influence as secretary has been somewhat obscured by the choice of highly visible emissaries for two of the world\u2019s hot spots: Mr. Holbrooke and George J. Mitchell as special envoy for the Middle East.\nSome foreign-policy experts say the arrangement poses a long-term risk to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI understand the logic of creating an empire of talented envoys,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East peace negotiator. \u201cBut to be a consequential secretary of state, you must put yourself directly in the middle of the mix.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton, however, described the envoys as \u201cforce multipliers\u201d and said that enlisting them \u201chas bought us time.\u201d She also said she had the \u201chighest esteem\u201d for General Jones, according to her adviser, Philippe Reines, who added in a statement, \u201cAnyone asserting otherwise is speaking for themselves, not the secretary.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has stepped up on key issues: warning Pakistan about the Taliban; orchestrating the first face-to-face contact between the Obama administration and Iran; and throwing Cuba off balance with warm words about restoring ties with Havana.\nFor Mrs. Clinton, the biggest challenge has been mental: absorbing a mountain of information on issues ranging from the Middle East to the race for fossil fuels in the Arctic Circle.\nAt 11 p.m. last Saturday, after 13 hours of meetings in Baghdad, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides dozed on the military transport plane flying back to Kuwait. She sat alone at the front of the plane\u2019s dimly lighted cargo bay, squinting as she plowed through a pile of briefing papers.\n\u201cI lug them everywhere,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, noting that she had not had time to watch a movie or read a book in the last 100 days.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/world/02clinton.html", "title": "Her Rival Now Her Boss, Clinton Settles Into New Role", "author": "MARK LANDLER"}

Among them were four proposed options for Kirkuk, each of which would require political accommodation among the groups competing for power: Kurds, Turkmens and Sunni and Shiite Arabs.\nEach of the proposals envisions keeping the province as a single entity, and each calls for Kirkuk residents to make the final decision as part of a referendum.\nThe report, which has been delayed since last year, was presented to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and other officials.\nMassoud Barzani, the leader of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, and other Kurds have said that Kirkuk, which is believed to have a Kurdish majority, should be incorporated into Kurdistan, which has operated as an autonomous region since 1991.\nA member of the Iraqi Parliament who read the report said that one of the four proposed options was the creation of an independent or autonomous region run by Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens. The budget of the region would be financed with a percentage of Kirkuk\u2019s oil revenues, according to the United Nations plan.\nA second option, according to the member of Parliament, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the report publicly, was for Kirkuk to become a special region, to be jointly administered by the regional and central governments. Under this proposal, a referendum would be held within five years to determine whether residents wanted Kirkuk to become part of the Kurdistan region or to be incorporated into the central state.\nKirkuk was excluded from Iraq\u2019s provincial elections in January to avoid inflaming tensions.\nIn other developments on Wednesday, a suicide bomber killed five people and wounded 13 others when he attacked a crowd of worshipers leaving a mosque in Salahuddin Province, north of Baghdad.\nAbu Yassir, who witnessed the attack, said he had seen a boy about 12 years old running toward the mosque at the end of evening prayers.\n\u201cPeople did not recognize him, and they got suspicious so they called out, \u2018Suicider!\u2019 to try to warn the mosque\u2019s security guards,\u201d he said.

{"date": "Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, in Poland to mark the 70th anniversary of the start of World War II, praised Polish soldiers and citizens on Tuesday for their wartime bravery, even as the Russian government unveiled what it said were previously classified documents showing prewar Polish cooperation with Nazi Germany.\nMr. Putin\u2019s remarks appeared aimed at dampening a row between Russia and Poland over each country\u2019s role in the war, a dispute that grew heated in the weeks before the anniversary.\n\u201cRussia has always respected the bravery and heroism of the Polish people, soldiers and officers, who stood up first against Nazism in 1939,\u201d Mr. Putin said in a meeting with the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, in the Baltic Sea resort town of Sopot.\nMr. Tusk said Mr. Putin\u2019s visit reflected a growing spirit of cooperation despite lingering disagreements.\n\u201cOur meeting showed from the first minute that we are making another step toward strengthening confidence in the past so that we can build our future on it,\u201d Mr. Tusk said in remarks translated into Russian on Mr. Putin\u2019s Web site.\nThe relative warmth stood in contrast to Polish frustrations with the United States; Mr. Tusk has taken pains to play down the fact that President Obama was represented at the memorial ceremonies by his national security adviser, which many Poles saw as a snub.\nPoland\u2019s traditionally close relations with Washington are already being tested by reports that the Obama administration is reviewing the Bush administration\u2019s plan to deploy parts of its antiballistic missile shield in Poland, as well as the Czech Republic, two Eastern European states eager for the American presence, particularly as Russia has grown more aggressive internationally.\nMoscow has opposed having the missile shield in Eastern Europe. Mr. Putin\u2019s remarks on Tuesday could have been intended to exploit Poland\u2019s frustration with Washington to repair the Kremlin\u2019s relationship with Warsaw.\nMany in Poland are angered by what they see as Russia\u2019s failure to acknowledge atrocities committed by the Soviet Union \u2014 including the massacre of Polish soldiers in the Katyn Forest and mass deportations \u2014 after its troops occupied eastern Poland weeks after the Nazis invaded the west of the country.\nAt a service attended by Mr. Putin in Gdansk on Tuesday, Poland\u2019s president, Lech Kaczynski, remarking on the Soviet invasion, said Moscow had \u201cstuck a knife in the back of Poland,\u201d according to Agence France-Presse.\nSuch sentiments have incensed many Russians, who view World War II and the victory over the Nazis as a paramount event in their history. By some estimates, about 25 million Soviet citizens died in the war, and many here believe those sacrifices were made to liberate Eastern Europe, not occupy it. About two-thirds of Russians think the Soviet Union could have defeated Nazi Germany alone, according to a recent poll of 1,600 people by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center that had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus about three percentage points.\nAttempts by Poland and other former Communist bloc countries to equate Nazi crimes and Soviet actions during the war have prompted a Russian backlash. A documentary on Russian state television last week claimed that, in the 1930s, Poland conspired with Germany and Japan to invade the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, President Dmitri A. Medvedev has created a panel to fight what the government says are falsifications of history that harm Russia\u2019s image.\nOn Tuesday, Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service unveiled archival documents said to show Polish cooperation with Nazi Germany before the war and Polish attempts to sow discord among the Soviet Union\u2019s ethnic nationalities.\n\u201cWithout a doubt, a portion of the blame for unleashing the Second World War lies with Poland, which is why they are attempting to distort historical fact,\u201d Lev F. Sotskov of the Foreign Intelligence Service told reporters in Moscow.\nPolish journalists challenged the documents\u2019 authenticity, asking why the Russian government had waited decades to unveil them, only to do so during Mr. Putin\u2019s visit. For those who questioned if the documents were genuine, Mr. Sotskov said, \u201cIt\u2019s their problem.\u201d\nIn Poland, however, Mr. Putin seemed to step back from historical debates, describing a shared failure to prevent \u201cthe bloodiest, most horrible war in the history of humanity.\u201d\n\u201cAll attempts between 1934 and 1939 to make peace with the Nazis, signing various agreements and pacts, were from a moral point of view unacceptable and from a practical point of view pointless, harmful and dangerous,\u201d he said at the Gdansk memorial service. \u201cIt is necessary to admit these mistakes, and our country has done this.\u201d\nThe remarks followed an article by Mr. Putin published on Monday in the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which characterized the Nazi-Soviet pact to divide Poland at the outset of World War II in 1939 as immoral.\nMr. Putin\u2019s performance in Poland drew praise from many erstwhile critics of Russia, if not completely fulfilling Polish demands for Russian accountability.\n\u201cThis is a very important and very symbolic visit,\u201d said Andrzej Halicki, chairman of the Polish Parliament\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee. He said Mr. Putin\u2019s statements left him optimistic about the future of their countries\u2019 relations, but added, \u201cThis would have been a good occasion to say \u2018sorry.\u2019 \u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/02/world/europe/02russia.html", "title": "In a Visit, Putin Tries to Ease Rifts With Poland", "author": "MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ"}
{"date": "Sun, 18 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 At least five commanders of Iran\u2019s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps were killed and dozens of other people were left dead and wounded on Sunday in two bombings in the restive southeast along Iran\u2019s frontier with Pakistan, according to Iranian state news agencies.\nThe coordinated strike, one of the largest against the Guards in the region, appeared to mark an escalation in hostilities between Iran\u2019s leadership and the Baluchi ethnic minority.\nIranian officials accused foreign enemies of supporting the insurgents, singling out the United States the day before Iran is set to meet for another round of delicate talks on its nuclear program with several Western countries.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that this violent and inhumane act was part of the strategy of foreigners and enemies of the regime and the revolution to destroy unity between Shias and Sunnis and create divisions among the unified ranks of the great Iranian people,\u201d said a statement issued by the Revolutionary Guards through the official IRNA news service.\nThe Baluchi insurgent group Jundallah \u2014 or Soldiers of God \u2014 took responsibility for the bombings, which included a suicide attack on a community meeting led by Revolutionary Guards and a roadside attack on a car full of Guards, both in the area of the city of Pishin.\nJundallah, whose members are Sunni Muslims, has claimed responsibility for other attacks in the region in recent years, and is believed to have killed hundreds of Iranian soldiers and civilians. The southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan has been the scene of attacks in the past, and in April the government put the Guards Corps in control of security there to try to stop the escalating violence.\nBy late Sunday, official news reports said 29 people had been killed, including several tribal leaders, and 28 wounded. The reports did not specify how many casualties were guards and how many civilians.\nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad promised \u201cthat those who committed such criminal and inhuman acts will receive their response soon,\u201d the state-run Press TV reported.\nIranian officials said they had evidence the attack was launched from within Pakistan, where Jundallah is based, and the Foreign Ministry late Sunday summoned Pakistan\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, Press TV said.\nAli Larijani, the speaker of Parliament, said the United States bore some responsibility for the attacks. \u201cIf they want relations with Iran, they must be frank,\u201d he said, according to the semiofficial ISNA news service, adding, \u201cWe consider the recent terrorist measure the outcome of the U.S. measures.\u201d\nIn the past, Iranian officials have accused the United States of financing and arming Jundallah.\nThe United States condemned the bombings and denied any connection with them. \u201cWe condemn this act of terrorism and mourn the loss of innocent lives,\u201d said Ian C. Kelly, a State Department spokesman. \u201cReports of alleged U.S. involvement are completely false.\u201d\nThe bombers struck early Sunday as the Guards prepared to bring regional Shiite and Sunni leaders together for a conference in Pishin to try to improve relations among the different communities, according to the Iranian news reports.\nIn one attack, a suicide bomber wearing a military uniform and an explosive belt entered a mosque where Guard commanders were organizing a reconciliation meeting, according to the semiofficial ILNA news service.\nIn the second attack, a car carrying a group of Guards members was bombed, state news agencies said.\nAccording to the Fars News Agency, which is affiliated with the Guards, those killed included the lieutenant commander of ground forces, Brig. Gen. Nourali Shoushtari, as well as the commanders of Sistan-Baluchistan province, the Iranshahr Corps, the Sarbaz Corps and the Amiralmoemenin Brigade.\nThe Baluchis, who are mostly Sunni, are one of many ethnic and religious minorities who have complained of discrimination in Iran, a predominantly Shiite Muslim and ethnically Persian nation.\nJundallah, which says it is fighting for greater autonomy for Baluchis in Iran and Pakistan, bombed a Shiite mosque in Zahedan, the capital of Sistan-Baluchistan, in May, killing 25 people. Jundallah rebels abducted and killed 16 Iranian soldiers late last year, and bombed a bus carrying Guards members in 2007, killing 11.\nIranian authorities hanged 13 members of the group in May, and have executed others previously.\nMustafa El-Labbad, director of the East Center for Regional and Strategic Studies in Cairo, said ethnic and sectarian divisions made the region particularly volatile. \u201cThere is the Baluchi versus Persian, and there is Sunni versus Shiite,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also lies on the border with Pakistan, which is not totally secured \u2014 weapons can come through. So there is a very explosive blend there.\u201d\nThe Guards have emerged as the most powerful political, social and economic bloc in the nation, eclipsing even the clergy and the conservatives. In the aftermath of Iran\u2019s contested presidential election, the Guards took control of national security, overseeing a violent crackdown on protests as well as mass arrests of protesters and critics.\nIn this context, Mr. Labbad said, an attack on the Guards \u2014 no matter the motivation \u2014 has symbolic resonance. \u201cIt is designed to affect the image of Iran,\u201d he said.\nIranian officials are scheduled to meet Monday in Vienna with officials of several countries to discuss an accord to ship uranium to Russia for enrichment, part of an effort by the West to try to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear program.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/world/middleeast/19iran.html", "title": "Iran Guard Commanders Are Killed in Bombings", "author": "MICHAEL SLACKMAN"}

{"date": "Fri, 19 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 When Ayatollah Ali Khamenei used his speech at Friday Prayer in Tehran to denounce Britain as \u201cthe most evil\u201d of Iran\u2019s enemies, he was striking a chord with a deep resonance in the psyche of Iranians, the legacy of a long history of British imperial intrusions into their country\u2019s affairs.\nSingling out Britain, and not the \u201cgreat Satan\u201d of the United States, so often the bugaboo for Iran\u2019s leadership since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, might seem an odd choice for Iran\u2019s supreme leader, when the government he leads faces its greatest crisis in 30 years.\nBut British scholars on Iran said Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s attack on Britain was characteristic of a Tehran leadership that resorts under pressure to a mix of crude stereotypes that play well at home. They said it might also reflect a concern not to slam the door opened by President Obama, who is offering a new dialogue in his search for a diplomatic solution to the impasse over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nIf that were the calculation, Ayatollah Khamenei may have correctly concluded that going after Britain would cost Iran little, judging by the carefully hedged response to the Tehran speech by Britain\u2019s prime minister, Gordon Brown. At a European summit meeting in Brussels, Mr. Brown noted the ayatollah\u2019s speech, but offered only a modest sharpening of Britain\u2019s previous admonitions to Tehran\u2019s leaders over their handling of the election crisis.\nLike Mr. Obama, Mr. Brown seemed determined not to give the Iranian leadership the excuse of foreign meddling to justify a crackdown on the protesters filling the streets of Iranian cities.\n\u201cWhat we want is to have a good relationship with Iran in the future, but that depends on Iran being able to show to the world that its elections have been conducted fairly and that there is no unfair suppression of rights or individuals,\u201d Mr. Brown said.\nIn focusing on Britain, the experts said, Mr. Khamenei was playing to popular resentment of Britain\u2019s long history of intervention in Iran, and perhaps avoiding confronting, at least for now, the renewed appeal America holds among many Iranians with Mr. Obama in the White House.\nStill, Mr. Khamenei\u2019s attack on Britain surprised some scholars. Ali Ansari, a professor of Iranian history at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said the attack suggested that Mr. Khamenei might be more beholden to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the official winner of the presidential election, than many Iran experts had thought. Animosity toward Britain is strongest among the working class and agrarian Iranians \u2014 Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s political base, he said.\n\u201cI think it just reflects the really quite bizarre view that Ahmadinejad and his supporters have,\u201d said Professor Ansari, whose father was an Iranian diplomat under the monarch ousted in 1979, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. He added, \u201cBritain has always been a bogeyman, but going back to that now, resorting to the villain of choice, if they really believe it, just shows how out of touch they really are.\u201d\nIranian popular culture has kept alive suspicions dating to the 18th century, when Britain, protecting its empire in India, began competing with Russia for influence in Iran. Britain\u2019s strategic interest deepened with the development of Iran\u2019s oil fields.\nAntipathies sharpened when Britain invaded Iran in 1941 and exiled the Iranian ruler, Reza Shah Pahlavi, suspected of pro-German sympathies. In 1953, British secret services worked with the Central Intelligence Agency to overthrow Mohammed Mossadegh, the nationalist prime minister. The issue then was the Mossadegh government\u2019s nationalization of Iran\u2019s oil fields, ending the monopoly of the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.\nMore recently, Britain\u2019s relations with Tehran were strained by the confrontation over the author Salman Rushdie. His novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d prompted Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the Islamic Revolution, to issue a call in 1989 for Muslims to kill Mr. Rushdie for what the ayatollah deemed to be the book\u2019s blasphemy. That led to a lengthy freeze in diplomatic relations, and to years in which Mr. Rushdie, a British citizen, lived in hiding under police protection.\nBut perhaps the sharpest thorn in Tehran\u2019s side has been the BBC\u2019s Persian-language services, by radio since the early 1940s, and by a recently established television channel. Millions of Iranians have come to rely on the BBC\u2019s reporting on Iran, regarding it, Professor Ansari said, as the \u201cmost trustworthy\u201d account of what is happening in their country.\nOn Friday, the BBC said it had decided to use two extra satellites to combat intensive jamming efforts by Iran, a step likely to be seen by Tehran as a direct challenge, given its assertions in recent days that foreign broadcasters \u2014 and Web services like Facebook and Twitter \u2014 are being used to foment unrest over the disputed election.\nBut Rosemary Hollis, a professor of Middle East studies at City University London, said Mr. Khamenei\u2019s attack on Britain may have been prompted by something more basic to the Iranian psyche, an old shibboleth in which Britain remains the dark force behind American power. \u201cStrange as it seems, they\u2019re convinced that the British are the clever ones, manipulating things behind the scenes,\u201d she said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/world/middleeast/20britain.html", "title": "Ayatollah Taps Into Distrust Rooted in History", "author": "JOHN F.

{"date": "Sun, 22 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "Following is a transcript of an interview with President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan, on Feb. 12, supplied by the Government Information Office of Taiwan. Keith Bradsher, of The New York Times, and Jeanne Moore, of The International Herald Tribune, conducted the interview.\nKeith Bradsher: What would you like for Secretary Clinton to be saying to the Chinese leadership during her visit to Beijing regarding cross-strait relations?\nPresident Ma Ying-jeou: I hope the American government and the secretary of state to encourage what my government has been doing with the mainland. For example, we have improved economic relations with the mainland in which we hope to comprehensively normalize our economic relationship. On the other hand, we have also reduced tensions in the Taiwan Strait; I think the U.S. can play a constructive role in encouraging the status quo.\nMr. Bradsher: As the Mrs. Clinton team prepares for this trip, they have been talking about energy, climate change, North Korea, Mideast policy; Taiwan has not been visible in their preparations. Are you concerned that this team will not be as focused on Taiwan-China relations?\nPresident Ma: It\u2019s quite clear that the situation across the Taiwan Strait is very different from what it was a couple years ago. Ever since we came to power we have effectively reduced tensions across the Taiwan Strait so that Taiwan is no longer a problem in relations between the United States and Beijing. I think this is good news for everyone. We\u2019re not dissatisfied with the fact that they didn\u2019t mention Taiwan. Many of our American friends advise us that \u201cno news is good news.\u201d\nAs we improve our relations with the mainland we also are restoring the mutual trust between Taiwan and the U.S., which was largely lost in the last eight years. This is very important for Taiwan because after all we have had a long security relationship with the U.S. Last October the Bush administration notified Congress about our request for defensive weaponry. That was also very important to us. On the one hand, we want to have peace with the mainland, but on the other hand, we also need to maintain our defense to achieve that purpose.\nMr Bradsher: Secretary Clinton has signaled that she wants the U.S.-Chinese relationship to be broader than the focus exclusively on economic issues. Is that good for Taiwan to have a broader engagement or is it good for Taiwan that, given the current global economic troubles, for the relationship to be focused on economics?\nPresident Ma: In our strategic point of view, the U.S. having a broader relationship with the mainland is not against our interests at all. Some of these issues concern us as well: antiterrorism, energy, sustainable environment, and so on.\nJeanne Moore: She also mentioned human rights.\nPresident Ma: Yes. This government is taking steps to ratify the two international covenants for human rights adopted by the U.N. back in 1966. We signed them in 1967 but didn\u2019t have the chance to ratify them because we lost our representation in the U.N. in 1971. Forty years later we decided to ratify these two covenants to enhance the human rights standards in Taiwan. We hope we will complete the process this year. Mainland China has ratified and signed the social, economic and cultural rights covenant, but for the civil and political right covenant they signed it but did not ratify it. So it would be interesting to see how human rights protection, freedom and democracy can be enhanced in different parts across the Taiwan Strait.\nMr. Bradsher: Has the coincidence of the financial tsunami with closer relations with the mainland made it harder to persuade the people of Taiwan that closer cross-straits relations are beneficial for the Taiwan economy?\nPresident Ma:No, it has not made it harder. Improvement of relations with the mainland has brought to Taiwan very tangible benefits: cost reductions, time savings, freer movement of people, goods, services, capital and information, lower political risks, better investment environment. With or without the financial tsunami we want to adopt right policies because the ultimate goal for our economic development for the current period is to first transform Taiwan into the innovation center of the world, second, the trade and investment hub in the Asia-Pacific, third, the headquarters for Taiwanese enterprises and Asia-Pacific headquarters of multinational firms. Therefore, the measures we have undertaken in regards to cross-strait relations have already made these three goals easier to achieve.\nAlso, our cross-strait policy has become our most popular-approved policy ever since we came to power. I can provide you with some of the opinion polls after the visit of Mr. Chen Yunlin \u2014 chairman of Mainland China\u2019s Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait \u2014 which would show the basic opinions of the people all around Taiwan. For farmers including fish farmers in the south, they are able to export their products to the mainland through seaports in the south, thus saving a lot of time. For example, fruit shipping used to take eight days because they had to go through Hong Kong, but now it takes less than four days. Farmers therefore don\u2019t have to pick their fruits prematurely, and the fruits can also have a longer shelf life after they arrive on the mainland. So, these developments are basically welcomed in Taiwan.\nMs. Moore: I wonder if they are just as welcomed in Hong Kong?\nPresident Ma: As far as the charter flights are concerned, right now there are only 108 flights per week. This accounts for only one-fifth of the total demand. In other words, most of the travel still goes through Hong Kong. That is why we have continuously asked the mainland to expand the current services, which probably will be done in a month or two. We hope before the middle of the year we can change the current charter flights to scheduled flights, which would improve cross-strait business because people would have more fixed travel schedules for them to choose from.\nMr. Bradsher: That said, we are looking at 500-600 tourists a day coming from the mainland; the ceiling had been 3000. Are you disappointed?\nPresident Ma: Yes, but the mainland has promised to allow more tourists to come to Taiwan and to allow more travel agencies to organize those tours. We have made serious complaints to the mainland side. The mainland was afraid that if they allow too many tourists to come to Taiwan, the tourists may not be in groove with Taiwan society. But that never happened; in the last seven months mainland tourists have been well accepted here, with very few incidences of trouble. So I think the mainland feels that it\u2019s also time to allow more tourists to come. We are also making it easier for them to come. The length of stay has been extended from 10 to 15 days. Mainland tourists need to come in groups, and we have reduced the group size from 10 to 5. We expect to see a surge of mainland tourists beginning in March.\nKeith Bradsher: How high will unemployment go in this downturn?\nPresident Ma: I think our situation is similar to Singapore. Since 70 percent of our GDP is dependent on exports, we\u2019re badly hit. On the one hand we will try to stimulate more exports; we have a special plan to achieve that goal. On the other hand, the emphasis has been shifted to the expansion of domestic demand. So we are heavily investing in infrastructure. Starting this year we will be investing more than $10 billion, hoping to create more jobs and build up our infrastructure so that in an economic upturn we will be ready to take full advantage of it. In the next couple of months we will be undertaking many measures to help provide jobs for our people. We dispensed shopping vouchers to stimulate consumption. Because we have a very high savings rate (about 29 percent), 9 percent of which is surplus savings rate, which could be used for consumption. The shopping vouchers helped to keep almost 50,000 jobs, especially in the service industries. Judging from what this measure has achieved in the last couple of weeks, we know that by and large small shops saw a surge of sales of about 20 to 30 percent. Everywhere I went I was asked to do it again.\nMr. Bradsher: Will you?\nPresident Ma: We haven\u2019t done the evaluation yet. We will do the evaluation later in May or June to see how much the shopping vouchers have contributed to our GDP growth. It was first estimated at 0.64 percent, but some people now say it could be 1 percent. We will see.\nMr. Bradsher: Some people said that you would do it again if it was 1 percent or more?\nPresident Ma: We don\u2019t know yet. Shopping voucher is but one part of the measures to rescue the economy. A lot more depends on the infrastructure projects. Infrastructure investment is the main thrust of our economic stimulus package.\nMr. Bradsher: At an unemployment center I was talking to a woman who is unemployed, 57. She said that she was worried about her unemployment benefits running out. I know there\u2019s talk to extend it for those over the age of 45. How much of a problem does Taiwan face for lower-income and older workers, for whom this may be their last years in the workforce, in this economic downturn?\nPresident Ma: Middle-aged people usually face a more difficult time, so this age group is also one of the target groups of our rescue effort. In a few months we will announce plans to help people to land on temporary jobs and if possible on relatively long-term jobs. This is the right time to really get fiscal. The greatest fear for our people is losing jobs. The government will certainly coordinate our efforts in creating jobs. Actually, on the first day of the New Year holiday our economic and financial ministers met here to work out plans to create more jobs. We met again on the ninth day of the holiday to finalize the plans. Although we can\u2019t solve the problem right away, we still hope we can keep the unemployment rate under 4.5 percent.\nMr. Bradsher: It\u2019s now 5 percent?\nPresident Ma: Yes. I admit this is a very ambitious plan. In the past, we once had an unemployment rate more than 5 percent in 2001-2002. Gradually it went down to 3.9 percent as of early last year. But it went up again.\nMr. Bradsher: Whose fault is the economic crisis in Taiwan now?\nPresident Ma: Taiwan heavily depends on exports, and a high percentage of our exports went to the U.S., Europe and mainland China. In the mainland our exports received value-added changes and then re-exported to other markets. Therefore, the U.S. was the largest export market for us if you combine our direct export to the U.S. and our re-export to the U.S. via mainland. When U.S. market is down, we are down. But I think we have made the right decisions in so far as the rescue plan is concerned. In less than three weeks after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in mid-September, my government announced that it would guarantee all bank deposits in early October. We were the first country to do that in Asia. The effect was magical; in three months the deposits of medium-sized banks increased by roughly $7 billion. In the first month we observed nearly $13 billion flowing back to those banks. They had lost their deposits to large banks with government stake because people had more confidence in government banks. But this measure changed everything. So the liquidity problem and other related problems had been largely taken care of. The financial industry so far is in good shape. We had some problems with our insurance companies, but in general our financial industry is OK. Now, our primary task is creating more jobs for people who have were laid off as a result of the financial tsunami.\nMr. Bradsher: Is positive economic growth this year still possible in Taiwan?\nPresident Ma: It depends on the recovery of our major export markets. Last year the government estimated this year\u2019s growth rate to be 2 to 2.5 percent, but most financial institutions around the world gave more pessimistic forecasts. Therefore, we have to work very hard to maintain positive growth.\nMr. Bradsher: Will it be -11 percent?\nPresident Ma: The government thinks that is a little too extreme, but we know the situation is severe, and we are working unceasingly.\nMr. Bradsher: I was talking to people in a market, and there was one man that said he voted for you but wished you would work harder. Is there more that can be done, or do you think your government is already doing everything, and if so, how do you persuade the people of Taiwan, including the people who voted for you?\nPresident Ma: As a president, I have to work for everyone whether they voted for me or not. Some of the efforts we have made have not generated results yet. For example, regarding the infrastructure projects, there is a relatively long process of bidding and other relevant measures before the money could enter the economy. The shopping vouchers were easier; people just need to spend them. We will see tangible results of the new infrastructure projects probably in spring or later this year. Actually, right after we came into office we started to expand domestic demand with a smaller project about $2.5 billion. Now all projects have gone through the bidding process, and we will be seeing results in the next couple of months. For the 2009 budget, we have already appropriated $10 billion for infrastructure projects.\nMr. Bradsher: Are you paying a price on this reliance on exports, and if so, what happens if you make yourself more into the Asia trade and innovation hub that you want to be?\nPresident Ma: The financial tsunami makes it possible to rethink our economic development strategy as to whether we should rely so much on exports. When the times were good everyone praised us. Now times are bad, we think we should attach more emphasis on domestic demand instead of putting all our eggs in one basket. This is exactly what we\u2019re doing now. In Taiwan, some of our infrastructure facilities need upgrading as the case for the U.S. Roads, bridges, schools, etc. This is a good time to spend in these areas. By the time the economy recovers we will have the chance to expand. Taiwan is an island, so we have to depend on international trade for our survival. We can\u2019t change that fact completely. The tsunami won\u2019t last forever, so we will still attach a lot of importance to exports. But perhaps the percentage won\u2019t be that large.\nMr. Bradsher: Are you satisfied that the rule of law has been followed in the prosecution of your predecessor, Mr. Chen Shui-bian?\nPresident Ma: Since the Special Investigation Division (S.I.D.) started investigating the former president when he stepped down I have taken a hands-off attitude. The S.I.D. was actually established by the former president himself, and the current prosecutor general was appointed by him. The former first lady was indicted three years ago. Therefore, the whole case and its development have nothing to do with my administration. And I will do everything in my power to maintain judicial impartiality. This is vital to our democracy. I have always maintained this principle since I was the justice minister. All the prosecutors were under my command, but I didn\u2019t interfere in any individual cases. I set the policies, but didn\u2019t get involved in any individual cases. Now I am the president. I should keep a distance from all judiciary cases to ensure that they are properly handled by prosecutors without any political interference of any kind.\nMr. Bradsher: I remember when you were the justice minister you were particularly zealous in going after corruption cases. Were you directing prosecutors under you to look into specific corruption cases then?\nPresident Ma: I only set policies. For example, I attached a lot of importance to vote buying, but I never specified which case the prosecutors should go after. That\u2019s their job. My job was to say, \u201cLet\u2019s put more resources in vote buying corruption cases.\u201d That yielded very tangible results. For example, in 1994 we had elections of local city/county councils and council speakers. There were 883 city/county council members and we indicted 341, almost 40 percent, many of whom belonged to my political party. It\u2019s very important to keep the government clean, and I\u2019m still doing that. I\u2019ve asked my prime minister to launch a program to maintain high standards of government official ethics in receiving gifts and attending banquets. People have been so dissatisfied with government ethics in the last nine years. Actually, I won the election on my campaign for a clean government. I will never get involved in particular cases. I will stay out of the judiciary. This is a very important principle of democracy.\nMr. Bradsher: There was a banquet last month in which a prosecutor raised her hand in a gesture that suggested she was a political prisoner. What is your reaction to that? I think the justice minister does not think that would compromise the impartiality of the judicial process. But to an American or to people like Jerome Cohen that seemed like a troubling case of prosecutors mocking defendants in a case that has not yet been tried.\nPresident Ma: I heard that it was a skit program by some of the prosecutors and it was not intended to humiliate anyone. Still the skit was not received well by society; I understand the justice minister has advised those involved to avoid such behavior in the future. Also the case has already been in the court so the skit has not influenced the decision of the judges. It\u2019s very important to keep the judiciary free from political interference.\nMr. Bradsher: Were you aware in advance of the decision to consolidate the trial of your predecessor with that of his wife, with the result that the panel of judges was changed and the new panel sent him back to jail?\nPresident Ma: No, because the two cases involved by and large the same people and had the same effects. Usually, the judiciary would like to combine the two so they won\u2019t be tried by a different panel of judges. For those in the judicial circle, this is quite common.\nMr. Bradsher: But the timing of it caught people\u2019s eye, that it happened immediately after the decision to release Mr. Chen from the detention center.\nPresident Ma: As far as I know, it was a request by the panel of judges that had released the former president without bail, because they thought their case, a later one, should be combined with the earlier case. But the panel of the earlier case didn\u2019t express any legal opinion, so it was decided by the higher court instead of by the panels. But, for those who are familiar with the judicial process, this is not unusual at all.\nMr. Bradsher: How did you feel about the comment by Mr. Jerome Cohen? I know you have known him since your time at Harvard. Is it sad for you to see the criticism that he has been leveling at you lately?\nPresident Ma: I think he has been very concerned about Taiwan\u2019s judiciary development and human rights. Certainly we appreciate that. He suggested that we set up an independent committee to make decisions on a number of things, but he probably did not understand that we have a permanent independent commission, our Control Yuan. It has the power to correct the behavior of the judiciary but not the judicial decision on specific substantive cases. For instance, the Control Yuan said that some of the prosecutors who met with the former president were behaving inappropriately. It asked the S.I.D. to change the behavior. Some people think the Control Yuan should do it later instead of now because this could interfere with the current prosecution process. But in any case, we already have an independent commission. There is no need to set up another one.\nFour years ago the Legislative Yuan did set up a commission to investigate the shooting of the president and the vice president, but the Council of Grand Justices later ruled that the composition of the commission was unconstitutional. So the commission didn\u2019t really work out well, and as such its report wasn\u2019t as credible as it could be. So when Mr. Cohen visited here, I said to him that that should be left to the Control Yuan. Later Mr. Cohen wrote a piece praising the government for abolishing a statue on taking hooligans into custody, which he has been criticizing for three decades because of its lack of human rights safeguards. Yesterday, we made a decision to ratify the two human rights conventions of the U.N. so that we could enhance Taiwan\u2019s human rights protection in line with the rest of the world. We also want to identify all those areas that need improvements. This is very much an important part of my policy.\nMs. Moore: What response have you had from the mainland to your intentions to ratify these conventions?\nPresident Ma: Well, we haven\u2019t heard anything yet. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re aware of it because I\u2019ve been talking about it since last year. It was also part of my campaign platform to enhance the human rights standards here. The New York-based Freedom House came to Taiwan last month to announce their Report on Freedom of the World. It was the first time for that group to come out of the U.S. to do that, and their idea is that Taiwan has made significant strides in the last several decades. From 1972 to 1975, when Freedom House first released its Report on Freedom of the World, Taiwan was rated not free. From 1976-96 Taiwan was rated partly free, and beginning in 1997 was rated free until now. While some of our critics say that Taiwan\u2019s freedom and democracy deteriorated in the last year, but the report announced we are still the same. There are two parts in the report: one is civil liberties, which we scored grade one, and for political rights we are grade two. Put together we\u2019re still in the free category. I asked why our political rights are on the second tier, but they were vague in their answer. We suspect it has something to do with corruption because last year and the year before that, government corruption had tarnished our image.\nMs. Moore: If you ratified the conventions it would put the spotlight back on Beijing for having the U.N. seat but not having ratified these UN conventions.\nPresident Ma: There can be a competition across the Taiwan Strait on this, which should be in the interest of everyone.\nMr. Bradsher: One thing to Americans that is surprising about the detention is this concept of detention incommunicado. It dates from 1946 Republic of China detention law, and there has been a review by the Justice Ministry whether you should retain this two-month detention plus an additional two month for complicated cases. You\u2019re deciding to retain it; is it really necessary? It seems like a long time: Japan is 10 days, and in the U.S. you have to charge someone almost immediately.\nPresident Ma: It\u2019s not in the review. Actually the Council of Grand Justices recently ruled that the meeting between the detainee and his lawyer should not be recorded by video, which was done in the past. In other words, now the detainee can have confidential conversations with their lawyers. The Detention Act is also being reviewed by the Justice Minister so that the detainees can receive better treatment. The detention center is different from jail, because those detainees are not criminals yet. But sometimes the distinction is blurred, and that should be corrected, and I agree. So the justice minister is doing that, and I encourage her to do that as quickly as possible. As far as the former president is concerned, the treatment he has received was not solely directed at him; it is equally applied to all detainees.\nMr. Bradsher: One DPP (Democratic Progressive Party, the party of former President Chen and the current opposition) person said that President Ma is setting a precedent for trials of former presidents as we\u2019ve seen in South Korea \u2014 \u201cIs he creating a precedent for a future trial of himself if the DPP administration were to go looking?\u201d\nPresident Ma: That depends on if I committed a crime or not. Actually, two years ago I was indicted on corruption charges. I didn\u2019t complain that this was political persecution. I just hired a lawyer and went through the entire judiciary process, three levels of courts, 13 appearances in courts, eventually I won every level and I was acquitted last year in April. When I was indicted, the KMT (the currently governing Nationalist Party) was not in power, and nobody came to my rescue. But I am a lawyer by profession, and I respect the judiciary. I didn\u2019t criticize the judiciary as being partial. Eventually all the judges accepted argument that I neither had the intention nor committed any crime of corruption. So when I was asked by journalists about what I think about the former president\u2019s case, my response is very simple: \u201cI will not get involved.\u201d I will only use that case to reflect on myself with regards to what is the proper behavior as the president of a country.\nMr. Bradsher: Would you consider a pardon for your predecessor to spare the country?\nPresident Ma: In this country a pardon cannot be given until the whole process is complete, so it\u2019s premature to say anything in this regard.\nMr. Bradsher: One possibility is that there might be a plea deal in which Mr. Chen might agree to plea guilty to something and then receive a bargain as part of that broader arrangement; has there been any discussion of that?\nPresident Ma: This is left entirely for the court to decide -- I have no comment whatsoever.\nMr. Bradsher: In cross-straits relations, it seems that you\u2019re still focusing on economics and investments but very little said on security issues like military confidence-building measures.\nPresident Ma: Some of the economic issues are more urgent. For instance, in the proposed third meeting between SEF (Straits Exchange Foundation) and ARATS (Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits) later this year, they have to negotiate the issue of a financial supervisory mechanism, to sign an MOU (memorandum of understanding). There will be interchange between the financial industries of the two sides. We also need to finalize deals on scheduled flights and a mechanism for cooperation to combat crimes across the Taiwan Strait.\nKeith Bradsher: Are you disappointed there has not been more interest on the part of the security establishment on the mainland in having discussions on confidence-building measures?\nPresident Ma: No, that\u2019s not the case. In a statement Mr. Hu Jintao made on December 31, 2008, he specifically mentioned security cooperation and CBMs. Yet we should move gradually from economic issues. Both sides haven\u2019t really discussed the issue of international space. But we have made our intentions known to them and their positive responses have already created a more peaceful environment between the two sides in the international arena. For instance, in the eight and half months since we\u2019ve come into office there has not been any upheaval in relations with our diplomatic allies. We said very clearly that we will not try to win over the recognition of their allies, and we expect the mainland to reciprocate in kind.\nThey understand there is good will on our side to have reconciliation not only across the Taiwan Strait but also in the international arena. We don\u2019t really have to engage in hard bargaining to get results; obviously they understand we intend to maintain peace in the region and in the international community. This is well understood and appreciated by many of our friends such as the U.S., E.U., Japan. Recently, there was a former American official who said that our action is almost universally welcomed.\nMs. Moore: They understand you want peace and representation in international organizations such as the World Health Organization, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to give it.\nPresident Ma: No, it doesn\u2019t mean we can get what we want, but they also understand that if Taiwan continues to be isolated in the international arena, cross-strait relations will not develop very smoothly. There is a clear link between cross-strait relations and our international space. We\u2019re not asking for recognition; we only want room to breathe. At the moment they have 171 allies, while we only have 23. There is very little marginal utility for them to gain recognition from our allies. As long as we are not pursuing a policy of de jure independence there is no urgency on their part to compete with us in the international arena. This is something many of our friends in Washington, Tokyo, Brussels, appreciate very much. In a nutshell, we are trying to work as peacemakers instead of troublemakers.\nMs. Moore: When are you going to Beijing?\nPresident Ma: No urgency at the moment. What I have in mind is to create a situation where the two sides can really coexist peacefully. I will not engage the other side on unification talks. Neither will I pursue a policy of de jure independence, and I\u2019m definitely opposed to the use of force. These policies truly reflect the will of the people here. There is a Taiwanese professor whose wife is the magistrate of Yunlin county. They came from a pro-green family (slang in Taiwan for supporters of the DPP) and the professor wrote a piece most recently calling for 50 years peace with the mainland, no unification, no independence, no use of force, exactly what I\u2019ve been calling for and promoting. Therefore, I believe my mainland policies are gaining momentum in not only the blue camp (KMT supporters) but in other sectors of Taiwan society. This is probably the most viable path for Taiwan. This will certainly benefit Taiwan, the region and the entire world.\nMr. Bradsher: Do you have any message to the Obama administration and Mrs. Clinton?\nPresident Ma: I was impressed with the congratulatory letter that then-candidate Obama sent me when I was elected. He specifically mentioned to restore the mutual trust between the U.S. and Taiwan. His letter was very well advised and knowledgeable. First, we hope we can continue the current cooperative mechanism and strengthen our mutual trust. Certainly, we depend on the support from the U.S. for our security. We also appreciate any cooperation and encouragement from the US side for our endeavors with the Chinese mainland. Other issues we would like to discuss with the U.S. include free trade; if possible, we could sign an FTA. There is also the issue of negotiating the import of U.S. beef with bone as well as possibly signing an extradition treaty so that we could have our fugitives at large extradited back here. We also hope Taiwan to be granted visa waivers by the U.S. Two days ago London announced that we would get visa waiver for students and tourists. If we are able to do that with the U.S., obviously Taiwan tourists to the U.S. will increase dramatically. This is true with Japan. After both countries decided to waive visa requirements, the number of tourists surged.\nFurthermore, when we are able to reduce the flashpoint in the Taiwan Strait, there is a marked improvement for the situation on both sides of the Pacific. My message is both Taiwan and the U.S. keep up the good work and together we will benefit everyone.\nMr. Bradsher: Is there a risk for the U.S. to lose closer relations with Taiwan?\nPresident Ma: No, we have very close relations with the U.S.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/world/asia/matranscript.html", "title": "An Interview With Ma Ying-jeou", "author": null}

The attacks left 163 people dead and have become a major sticking point in relations between India and Pakistan.\nCharges against the suspects had been expected since February, when Pakistan said it was holding several men and acknowledged for the first time that the attacks had been planned in Pakistan. But months of postponements and legal hearings followed, delaying the indictments until Wednesday.\nThe seven include the man suspected of being the operation\u2019s organizer, Zaki ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the commander of the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba; Hammad Amin Sadiq, who is accused of coordinating the financing; and Zarar Shah, described as a computer and networks expert. All pleaded not guilty, according to a defense lawyer.\nBut Pakistan has said it does not have enough evidence to charge the man Indian and Western officials have accused of masterminding the attacks: Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, one of the main founders of Lashkar-e-Taiba.\nThe case is highly charged, in part because Lashkar-e-Taiba was nurtured by Pakistan itself as part of a proxy war against India in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir. Recruiting took place in the open on college campuses throughout the 1990s but was stopped after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nPakistan says that it has stopped all support to the organization and that splinter groups are now operating as rogue militants. But the government has been slow to act against them, casting doubts that the authorities have cut all ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba.\nFraught relations between Pakistan and India, both armed with nuclear weapons, deteriorated further after the Mumbai attacks, as Pakistan denied any connection; India suspended peace talks while pressing Pakistan to bring the plotters to justice.\nThe charges against the seven suspects will offer a crucial test of Pakistan\u2019s will to pursue the case.\nOn Wednesday, the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, in Washington on an official visit, welcomed news of the charges but said that Pakistan had not gone far enough to pursue militants within its borders.\n\u201cIt is our strong feeling that the government of Pakistan could do more to bring to book people who are still roaming around in the country freely and to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism, and I can only hope that there will be progress in that area,\u201d Mr. Singh told reporters, according to Agence France-Presse.\nPakistan\u2019s interior minister, Rehman Malik, said by telephone that Pakistan was carrying out its promise to put the accused men on trial.\nThe hearing on Wednesday was in a makeshift courtroom in a high-security detention center in the city of Rawalpindi, where Pakistan\u2019s Army is based, just outside Islamabad, the capital.\nA defense lawyer characterized the prosecution\u2019s case as weak and concocted. \u201cThe charges leveled against the accused are not supported by witness testimony and documentary evidence,\u201d said Shahbaz Rajpoot, one of five lawyers representing the defendants. \u201cThese charges are being framed upon pressure from external forces.\u201d\nBut Pakistan\u2019s criminal justice system is extremely weak. Intimidation of witnesses is routine, and prosecutors will be hard pressed to persuade people to take the stand against such a powerful, well-connected militant group.\nBecause of political wrangling between India and Pakistan, evidence is being exchanged through ministries instead of law enforcement agencies, possibly complicating the trial, said Ahmer Bilal Soofi, an international law expert.\nThe next hearing has been set for Dec. 5.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/world/asia/26mumbai.html", "title": "Pakistan Charges 7 Terrorism Suspects a Year After Attacks That Shocked Mumbai", "author": "SAHAR HABIB GHAZI and SABRINA TAVERNISE"}

{"date": "Sat, 16 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 Looking across the courtroom where he is on trial for crimes against humanity, the chief Khmer Rouge torturer cannot avoid seeing an artist and a mechanic who sit watching him but mostly avoid his gaze.\nOne short and forceful, his feet dangling just above the floor, the other melancholy and drooping a bit, they are rare survivors of Tuol Sleng prison, where at least 14,000 people were sent to their deaths three decades ago.\nIn the weeks ahead, the two survivors will take the stand to testify against their torturer, Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who commanded the prison, and both have stories to tell about a place of horror from which almost no one emerged alive.\nBou Meng, 68, the short one, survived because he was a painter and was singled out from a row of shackled prisoners to produce portraits of the Khmer Rouge chief, Pol Pot.\nThe other, Chum Mey, 78, was a mechanic and was spared because the torturers needed him to repair machines, including the typewriters used to record the confessions \u2014 very often false \u2014 that they extracted from prisoners like himself.\nDuch (pronounced DOIK), 66, is the first of five arrested Khmer Rouge figures to go on trial in the United Nations-backed tribunal here. His case began in February and is expected to last several more months.\nMr. Bou Meng and Mr. Chum Mey are living exhibits \u2014 like a third survivor, Vann Nath \u2014 from the darkest core of the Khmer Rouge atrocities. They are tangible evidence, like the skulls that have been preserved at some killing fields, or like hundreds of portraits of their fellow prisoners that are displayed on the walls of Tuol Sleng.\nThe photographs were taken as detainees were delivered to the prison, before they were stripped and fettered and tortured and sent to a killing field.\nThose ordered killed at Tuol Sleng are among 1.7 million people who died during the Communist Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 to 1979 from starvation, disease and overwork, as well as from torture and execution.\nDuch is accused of ordering the kinds of beatings, whippings, electric shocks and removal of toenails that Mr. Bou Meng and Mr. Chum Mey describe; indeed, he admitted in the courtroom to ordering the beating of Mr. Chum Mey.\nBoth men endured torture that continued for days, and Mr. Chum Mey said, \u201cAt that time I wished I could die rather than survive.\u201d\nBut both men did survive, and in interviews they now describe scenes that almost none of their fellow prisoners lived to recount. \u201cEvery night I looked out at the moon,\u201d Mr. Bou Meng recalled. \u201cI heard people crying and sighing around the building. I heard people calling out, \u2018Mother, help me! Mother, help me!\u2019 \u201d\nIt was at night that prisoners were trucked out to a killing field, and every night, he said, he feared that his moment had come. \u201cBut by midnight or 1 a.m. I realized that I would live another day.\u201d\nThough many Cambodians have tried to bury their traumatic memories, Mr. Bou Meng and Mr. Chum Mey have continued to return to the scene of their imprisonment and torture as if their souls remained trapped there together with the souls of the dead.\nDuring the first few years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, Mr. Bou Meng returned to work in an office at Tuol Sleng, which was converted into a museum of genocide. Now he uses it as a rest stop, spending the night there on a cot when he visits the capital, Phnom Penh, from the countryside, where he paints Buddhist murals in temples.\nMr. Chum Mey, retired now from his work as a mechanic, spends much of his time wandering among the portraits, telling and retelling his story to tourists, as if one of the victims on the walls had come to life.\nAn eager and passionate storyteller, he will show a visitor how he was shoved, blindfolded, into his cell during 12 days of torture, and he will drop to the floor inside a small brick cubicle where he was held in chains.\n\u201cAs you can see, this was my condition,\u201d he said recently as he sat on the hard concrete floor, holding up a metal ammunition box that was used as a toilet. \u201cIt upsets me to see Duch sitting in the courtroom talking with his lawyers as if he were a guest of the court.\u201d\nLike many other Khmer Rouge victims, both men say they have no idea why they were selected for arrest or why they were tortured to admit to unknown crimes. Both men lost their wives and children in the Khmer Rouge years, and although both have rebuilt their families, the past still holds them in its grip.\nMr. Bou Meng does not wander like his friend among the Tuol Sleng pictures, but he does keep one in his wallet: a snapshot-size reproduction of the prison portrait of his wife, Ma Yoeun, who was arrested with him but did not survive.\n\u201cSometimes when I sit at home I look at the picture and everything seems fresh,\u201d he said. \u201cI think of the suffering she endured, and I wonder how long she stayed alive.\u201d\nMr. Bou Meng has since remarried twice, but he remains shackled to his memories. \u201cI know I should forget her,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t.\u201d\nShe visits him, he said, in visions that are something more than dreams, looking just as she did when he last saw her \u2014 still 28 years old, leaving Mr. Bou Meng to live on and grow old without her.\nSometimes she appears with the spirits of others who were killed, he said. They stand together, a crowd of ghosts in black, and she tells him, \u201cOnly you, Bou Meng, can find justice for us.\u201d\nMr. Bou Meng said he hoped that testifying against Duch and seeing him convicted would free him from the restless ghosts and let him live what is left of his life in peace.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a victim,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be like everybody else, a normal person.\u201d\nBut he said he knew that this might be asking too much of life.\n\u201cMaybe not completely normal,\u201d Mr. Bou Meng said. \u201cBut at least 50 percent.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/world/asia/17cambo.html", "title": "Survivors Shed Light on Dark Days of Khmer Rouge", "author": "SETH MYDANS"}
{"date": "Sat, 03 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "EREZ CROSSING, on the Israel-Gaza border \u2014 As Israel\u2019s tanks and troops poured into Gaza on Saturday, the next phase in its fierce attempt to end rocket attacks, a question hung over the operation: can the rockets really be stopped for any length of time while Hamas remains in power in Gaza?\nAnd if the answer is determined to be no, then is the real aim of the operation to remove Hamas entirely, no matter the cost?\nAfter her visit to Paris on Thursday to explain to French authorities why she thought this was not the time for a quick cease-fire, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni of Israel said, \u201cThere is no doubt that as long as Hamas controls Gaza, it is a problem for Israel, a problem for the Palestinians and a problem for the entire region.\u201d\nVice Premier Haim Ramon went even further Friday night in an interview on Israeli television, saying Israel must not end this operation with Hamas in charge of Gaza.\n\u201cWhat I think we need to do is to reach a situation in which we do not allow Hamas to govern,\u201d Mr. Ramon said on Channel One. \u201cThat is the most important thing.\u201d\nNeither Prime Minister Ehud Olmert nor Defense Minister Ehud Barak has made such a statement. Still, there is a growing and shared concern among Israeli leaders that any letup against Hamas would be problematic for Israel\u2019s broad goals in the long term because it could bolster and validate the group, which says Israel should be destroyed.\n\u201cIf the war ends in a draw, as expected, and Israel refrains from re-occupying Gaza, Hamas will gain diplomatic recognition,\u201d wrote Aluf Benn, a political analyst, in the newspaper Haaretz on Friday. \u201cNo matter what you call it,\u201d he added, \u201cHamas will obtain legitimacy.\u201d\nIn addition, any potential truce deal would probably include an increase in commercial traffic from Israel and Egypt into Gaza, which is Hamas\u2019s central demand: to end the economic boycott and border closing it has been facing. To build up the Gaza economy under Hamas, Israeli leaders say, would be to build up Hamas. Yet withholding the commerce would continue to leave 1.5 million Gazans living in despair.\nImplicit in Mr. Benn\u2019s argument, however, is that the only way to stop Hamas from gaining legitimacy is for Israel to fully occupy Gaza again, more than three years after removing its soldiers and settlers. That is a prospect practically no one in Israel or abroad is advocating.\nMoreover, while it may sound decisive to speak of taking Hamas out of power, almost no one familiar with Gaza and Palestinian politics considers it realistic. Hamas legislators won a democratic majority in elections four years ago, and the group has 15,000 to 20,000 men under arms. It has consolidated its rule in the past 18 months since pushing out its rivals loyal to the more Western-oriented and moderate Fatah party of President Mahmoud Abbas, who sits in Ramallah in the West Bank.\nAnd while there are plenty of Gazans who would prefer Fatah, they seem hardly organized or strong enough to become the new rulers, even with the help of former colleagues in exile in Ramallah who say, anyway, that they would never be willing to ride into Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank. In fact, the longer Israel pounds Gaza, the weaker Fatah is likely to become because it will be seen as collaborating.\nThe likelier result of a destruction of the Hamas infrastructure, then, would be chaos, anathema not only to the people of Gaza but also to those hoping for peace in southern Israel.\nYet in its campaign so far, which has killed scores of children and other bystanders, Israel has not spared the trappings of Hamas sovereignty or limited itself to military targets. It says that the mosques it has destroyed were weapons storehouses and that the Islamic University, which it has hit repeatedly, housed explosives factories. But it has also reduced many government buildings to rubble without any claim that they were military in nature.\n\u201cThe government buildings are a place where financial, logistical and human resources serve to support terror,\u201d said Capt. Benjamin Rutland, a spokesman for the Israeli military. \u201cMuch of the government is involved in the active support and planning of terror.\u201d\nTaken together, it suggests that even if Israel intends to hold back from completely overthrowing Hamas, its choice of assault tactics could head that way anyway. And the Israelis may already be facing a kind of mission creep: after all, if enough of Hamas\u2019s infrastructure is destroyed, the prospect of governing Gaza, a densely populated, refugee-filled area whose weak economy has been devastated by the Israeli-led boycott, will be exceedingly difficult.\nIn the background, too, is broad international criticism of this war on Gaza, not only because of the unspeakable suffering seen on television screens but also because of a feeling that Israel has tried such tactics in the past and never succeeded.\nIn particular, many point to the 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, where Israel also tried to destroy rocket launchers and a hostile organization\u2019s infrastructure, only to end up killing many civilians and leaving Hezbollah more popular and perhaps ultimately stronger than before the war.\nBut military planners here say that the parallel is inexact and that they, too, have learned a lesson. Gaza is smaller and flatter than southern Lebanon and, most important, does not have a sievelike border with a country like Syria where arms can be constantly resupplied. Destroying the smuggler tunnels from the Egyptian Sinai into Gaza and systematically eliminating weapons depots and launcher sites, along with their supporting infrastructures, will ultimately succeed, they contend.\nIt may take weeks or months, they assert, but it can work. If true, questions still remain: At what human cost?

But he suggested that the government had shown leniency toward the 950 people who had been detained since the March 14 riots. \u201cWe have been restraining ourselves to a large extent,\u201d he said, according to Xinhua. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been using destructive weapons.\u201d\nThe disturbances, which began after a peaceful protest by monks turned violent, deeply rattled the Communist Party in the months leading up to the Beijing Olympics and drew heightened international attention to the plight of Tibetans, many of whom resent China\u2019s heavy-handed role in their religious and cultural affairs since it seized control of the Himalayan territory in 1951.\nAlthough most of the dead were ethnic Han Chinese killed by Tibetan mobs, exile groups contend that scores of monks, nuns and other Tibetans died in the government\u2019s ensuing crackdown.\nWith just a month until the 50th anniversary of the uprising that led to the exile of the Dalai Lama, Tibet\u2019s revered spiritual leader, Beijing is nervous about the potential for unrest in Tibet and adjoining provinces that have heavily Tibetan populations.\nIn a sign of the Chinese government\u2019s tough attitude, it recently renamed that anniversary \u201cSerf Emancipation Day.\u201d\nIn recent weeks there has been a growing call for people to show their displeasure with Chinese rule in Tibet by boycotting Tibetan new year festivities, known as Losar. In e-mail messages and through word of mouth, people have been told to refrain from setting off fireworks or singing during the holiday period, which begins on Feb. 25. The government has responded by handing out free fireworks and urging people to resist the calls of people they pejoratively describe as splittists.\nSince December, according to the state media, dozens of people in Lhasa have been detained for advocating Tibetan independence, \u201cspreading rumors\u201d and fomenting social unrest. Most of those taken in during sweeps of Internet cafes and outdoor markets were found to have downloaded or sold banned music that acknowledges the Dalai Lama or advocates Tibetan independence.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/asia/12tibet.html", "title": "China Says 21 More People Will Go to Prison in Tibet Protests", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}

{"date": "Sat, 17 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentines woke up Thursday feeling as if a great weight had been lifted from their collective shoulders. After a 1-0 victory over Uruguay, Argentina\u2019s soccer team qualified for the World Cup in South Africa next summer, despite growing doubts that Coach Diego Maradona could lead it there.\nBut Argentines also awoke to the realization that the team would still be coached by Mr. Maradona, the soccer idol known worldwide simply as Maradona, whose brilliant playing career made him a national hero but whose erratic tenure as coach has become a source of national dread. Argentines fear that in one downward swoop, they could lose two symbols of national pride: the glorious legend of Maradona as well as the nation\u2019s standing as a global soccer power.\n\u201cThe Argentines that believed that Maradona could infect the players with the winning magic that\u2019s rooted in his luminous past don\u2019t believe that now, after having built up excessive expectations,\u201d said Roberto Di Giano, a sociologist at the University of Buenos Aires.\n\u201cWhat could lift the country now,\u201d he said, \u201cwould be if he could win the World Cup\u201d and \u201cfeed our delusions of grandeur.\u201d\nThat is a lot of national aspiration riding on Mr. Maradona\u2019s shoulders. Argentina has not had much in the way of grandeur lately.\nThis decade, Argentina has suffered through its worst financial crisis in a century, and more recently it has been plagued by incessant strikes by farm groups. The government of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner has scared away foreign investors with untrustworthy economic figures and heavy subsidies for food and fuel, and it has moved to exercise more control over the media. Then there is the nagging sense that neighboring Brazil, which has discovered vast oil deposits and won the 2016 Summer Olympics, is becoming an ever more important global player while Argentina is lagging behind, political analysts and sociologists said.\nBut soccer has long been sacred and Argentina\u2019s spot in the world\u2019s most important competitions always assured. Mr. Maradona, 48, who grew up in a Buenos Aires shantytown, is among the greatest players ever in the game. Since he led the national team to a World Cup championship in 1986, he has been treated as a demigod, and many Argentines firmly believe that his playing genius was the result of divine inspiration.\nHis early years and international career from 1979 to 1994, much of it in Spain and Italy, gave Argentines a rousing distraction from a brutal dictatorship and a failed war with Britain, the rebirth of democracy and periodic financial crises. It was also a time when soccer went global, and Mr. Maradona\u2019s transfer to Barcelona FC in 1982, when he was 21, cost a record $7.3 million.\n\u201cIn this context, Maradona was the perfect hero in cultural terms,\u201d said Pablo Alabarces, an Argentine sociologist and author of books on soccer and popular culture. And despite the Argentine media\u2019s almost obsessive search for Mr. Maradona\u2019s heir, \u201cit isn\u2019t something that is repeatable today.\u201d\nStill, he is a flawed character, a substance abuser who struggled with the trappings of stardom and bristled at criticism. Aside from persistent problems with cocaine, Mr. Maradona tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine during the 1994 World Cup and was banned from the tournament.\nNonetheless, when Argentina\u2019s national coach resigned last fall, Julio Grondona, the autocratic president of the Argentine Football Association, appointed Mr. Maradona. As much as they loved him as a player, most Argentines thought he was spectacularly ill suited to coach, as he had virtually no coaching experience.\nSince he took over the team, it has won four World Cup qualifying matches and lost four, despite having standout international stars like Lionel Messi and Carlos T\u00e9vez. The team became a revolving door for Mr. Maradona\u2019s indecision and experimentation; only one player, Mr. Messi, played in all eight of the matches that Mr. Maradona coached.\nAfter losses to Paraguay and Brazil in September, with his team in seeming chaos, Mr. Maradona shocked the nation by flying to Italy for 11 days to go to a weight-loss spa. His doctor said the treatment had been planned ahead of time.\nMr. Maradona\u2019s star sank even further, and a malaise swept the country. His failure as a coach not only was tarnishing his status as national icon, but also was on the verge of depriving Argentina of the right to play in the World Cup for the first time in 40 years.\nThen in a remarkable game on Oct. 10, a bit of the old luster returned. In a match against a scrappy Peruvian team, amid a blinding rain and ball-tossing wind, Mart\u00edn Palermo chipped in the winning goal for Argentina in the final minute. Mr. Maradona promptly did a belly flop on the drenched field in Buenos Aires before burying his head in Mr. Palermo\u2019s chest, sobbing and hugging him for several minutes. Mr. Maradona later said that \u201cSt. Martin\u201d had saved the day.\nOn Wednesday, the team edged past Uruguay, and Mr. Maradona gloated at a postmatch news conference, refusing to take any responsibility for the team\u2019s struggles and lashing out at the journalists \u201cwho treated me like garbage.\u201d\nHe taunted his critics with sexual vulgarities, adding, \u201cAll those that said anything against me, keep eating your words.\u201d\nOn Friday, Joseph Blatter, the president of FIFA, world soccer\u2019s governing body, said it would investigate Mr. Maradona\u2019s statements for possible disciplinary action, according to press reports.\nMr. Maradona did not back off, saying Friday on Radio Continental, \u201cI don\u2019t have to ask forgiveness of anybody.\u201d\nGustavo Sorange, 47, a carpenter from Gen. Juan Madariaga, southeast of Buenos Aires, said some of his friends were so disillusioned with Mr. Maradona that they rooted for Uruguay.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want Argentina to win because of Maradona,\u201d he said, stunned at the betrayal. \u201cThat\u2019s the way things are here in Argentina. You win well, you play beautifully. And if you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re not good for anything.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/world/americas/18argentina.html", "title": "For Argentines, a Coach Is a Legend and a Letdown", "author": "CHARLES NEWBERY and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO"}

{"date": "Sat, 21 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PARIS \u2014 Every time Radovan Karadzic, the onetime Bosnian Serb leader, appears in court on war crimes charges, he has hammered on one recurring claim: a senior American official pledged that he would never be standing there.\nThe official, Richard C. Holbrooke, now a special envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan for the Obama administration, has repeatedly denied promising Mr. Karadzic immunity from prosecution in exchange for abandoning power after the Bosnian war.\nBut the rumor persists, and different versions have recently emerged that line up with Mr. Karadzic\u2019s assertion, including a new historical study of the Yugoslav wars published by Purdue University in Indiana.\nCharles W. Ingrao, the study\u2019s co-editor, said that three senior State Department officials, one of them retired, and several other people with knowledge of Mr. Holbrooke\u2019s activities told him that Mr. Holbrooke assured Mr. Karadzic in July 1996 that he would not be pursued by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague if he left politics.\nMr. Karadzic had already been charged by the tribunal with genocide and other crimes against civilians.\nTwo of the sources cited anonymously in the new study, a former senior State Department official who spent almost a decade in the Balkans and another American who was involved with international peacekeeping there in the 1990s, provided additional details in interviews with The New York Times, speaking on condition that they not be further identified.\nThe former State Department official said he was told of the offer by people who were close to Mr. Holbrooke\u2019s team at the time. The other source said that Mr. Holbrooke personally and emphatically told him about the deal on two occasions.\nWhile the two men agreed, as one of them put it, that \u201cHolbrooke did the right thing and got the job done,\u201d the recurring story of the deal has dogged Mr. Holbrooke.\nLast summer, after more than a decade on the run, Mr. Karadzic was found living disguised in Belgrade, Serbia\u2019s capital. He was arrested and sent to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague for his trial, which is expected to start this year.\nAsked for comment for this article, Mr. Holbrooke repeated his denial in a written statement. \u201cNo one in the U.S. government ever promised anything, nor made a deal of any sort with Karadzic,\u201d he said, noting that Mr. Karadzic stepped down in the summer of 1996 under intense American pressure.\n\u201cIn subsequent meetings, as a private citizen, I repeatedly urged officials in both the Clinton and Bush administrations to capture Karadzic,\u201d Mr. Holbrooke said. \u201cI am glad he has finally been brought to justice, even though he uses his public platform to disseminate these fabrications.\u201d\nMr. Holbrooke declined to accept further questions and did not address the specifics of the new accounts.\nMr. Karadzic, by insisting that he is exempt from legal proceedings, has now forced the war crimes tribunal to deal with his allegations, illustrating the difficulty of both administering international justice and conducting diplomacy.\nIn December, tribunal judges ruled that even if a deal had been made, it would have no bearing on a trial. They said no immunity agreement would be valid before an international tribunal in a case of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity. Mr. Karadzic is charged with all three.\nBut Mr. Karadzic has appealed and filed motions demanding that prosecutors disclose every scrap of confidential evidence about negotiations with Mr. Holbrooke. He has asked his lawyers to seek meetings with American diplomats.\nHis demands have led the court to write to the United States government for clarification.\nPeter Robinson, a lawyer for Mr. Karadzic, said that he had received a promise from Washington that he could interview Philip S. Goldberg, who was on the Holbrooke team meeting in Belgrade the night the resignation was negotiated.\n\u201cGoldberg took the notes at that meeting,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cThe U.S. government has agreed to search for the notes and provide them if they find them.\u201d\nA State Department spokesman said that the government was cooperating with the tribunal, but would provide no further details.\nMr. Holbrooke, who brokered the peace agreement that ended the Bosnian war in 1995, returned to Belgrade in 1996 to press Mr. Karadzic to resign as president of the Bosnian Serb republic. Mr. Holbrooke\u2019s memoirs recount a night of fierce negotiation on July 18, 1996, but make no mention of any pledge of immunity.\nThe Purdue University study, \u201cConfronting the Yugoslav Controversies: A Scholars\u2019 Initiative,\u201d says that Mr. Holbrooke \u201cinstructed his principal assistant, Christopher Hill, to draft the memorandum to be signed by Karadzic,\u201d committing him to give up power.\nMr. Ingrao said Mr. Holbrooke used Slobodan Milosevic, then the Serbian leader, and other Serbian officials as intermediaries to convey the promise of immunity and to reach the deal with Mr. Karadzic.\n\u201cThe agreement almost came to grief when Holbrooke vigorously refused Karadzic\u2019s demand, and Hill\u2019s appeal, that he affix his signature to it,\u201d the study says, citing unidentified State Department sources.\nThe study, the product of eight years of research by historians, jurists and social scientists from all sides of the conflict, was an effort to reconcile disparate views of the wars that tore the former Yugoslavia apart in the 1990s, Mr. Ingrao said.\nNeither Mr. Hill nor Mr. Goldberg responded to requests for interviews for this article.\nIn an interview, the former State Department official, who had access to confidential reports and to members of the Holbrooke team, said that during that evening in 1996, Mr. Milosevic and other Serbian officials were on the phone with Mr. Karadzic, who was in Pale, Bosnia.\nThe former official said that Mr. Karadzic wanted written assurances that he would not be pursued for war crimes and refused to sign without them.\n\u201cHolbrooke told the Serbs, \u2018You can give him my word he won\u2019t be pursued,\u2019 but Holbrooke refused to sign anything,\u201d the official said. Mr. Holbrooke could make that promise because he knew that American and other Western militaries in Bosnia were not then making arrests, the official said.\nThere were some 60,000 American and NATO troops in Bosnia, but the soldiers had no orders to arrest indicted Bosnians, for fear of inciting local rebellion.\nIn the brief statement Mr. Karadzic eventually signed, he agreed to withdraw \u201cfrom all political activities\u201d and to step down from office. It carried the signatures of Mr. Milosevic and four other Serbian leaders acting as witnesses and guarantors. It did not include any Americans\u2019 names and made no mention of immunity.\nThe American who was involved in peacekeeping insisted in an interview that Mr. Holbrooke himself told him that he had made a deal with Mr. Karadzic to get him to leave politics. He recalled meeting Mr. Holbrooke in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on the eve of Bosnian elections in November 2000, just after Mr. Milosevic had finally been ousted from power in Serbia.\nMr. Holbrooke was worried about the outcome of the Bosnian vote because he knew that Mr. Karadzic was still secretly running his nationalist political party and picking candidates, including mayors and police chiefs who had run prison camps and organized massacres.\n\u201cHolbrooke was angry; he was ranting,\u201d the American recalled.

{"date": "Fri, 13 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 Last week, a finely dressed Chinese man walked into Louis Vuitton\u2019s flagship store here, seeking the perfect gift for that special someone: a senior government official.\n\u201cI tell you, he is at the top,\u201d the man told the sales clerk, as his bodyguard stood nearby. \u201cSo what kind of handbag do you think is suitable for him?\u201d\nPurchases like this one are part of a two-week shopping spree every March, when up to 5,000 Communist Party delegates from China\u2019s provinces and regions gather in the capital for two annual meetings: the National People\u2019s Congress and the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference. Their mission is to assess the nation\u2019s progress and debate public policy.\nBut while here, the delegates also seek to curry favor with their superiors, the nation\u2019s top leaders, often by showering them with expensive gifts: Gucci handbags, Herm\u00e8s scarves, Montblanc pens and $30,000 diamond-studded Swiss watches.\nThough sales spike in March during the national congresses, executives of luxury goods companies say that lavishing government officials with such products is a year-round practice that reflects China\u2019s culture of gift-giving and tradition of basing business decisions on personal relationships. They admit to having special accounts for government officials, their relatives and even their mistresses, often with code names like Dr. No and Miss K.\nLuxury producers also keep profiles of their customers\u2019 fashion tastes. Government officials, for example, favor Ermenegildo Zegna suits and Salvatore Ferragamo shoes, the executives say. They dislike gifts with big noticeable logos, lest the bribe be too obvious. And they mostly covet expensive watches, which are easily hidden and sometimes traded for cash.\nThe gifts are essentially bribes or kickbacks, and they are prohibited under Chinese law. But in China, legal experts say, bribery laws are selectively enforced, and party members in good standing are rarely investigated.\nAs a result, the practice of bribing government officials \u2014 by other government officials and, more commonly, by private businessmen \u2014 is so widespread that luxury goods producers have come to count on it as an increasingly important revenue source.\nChina is now the world\u2019s fastest-growing luxury market, with an estimated $7.6 billion in sales last year, according to Bain & Company, a global consulting firm. And industry experts say gifts to government officials make up close to 50 percent of the country\u2019s luxury sales.\nWhen lower level government officials are the gift-givers, the purchases are usually made with state money, or are paid for by private entrepreneurs. \u201cThe government officials are not really buying it \u2014 they have modest incomes,\u201d said Radha Chadha, co-author of \u201cThe Cult of the Luxury Brand\u201d and an expert on luxury brands in Asia. \u201cSomebody else does the buying and gifts the stuff to them.\u201d\nThat is what is apparently happening in Beijing this month as party cadres and their friends search out brand names like Ferragamo, Dior and Cartier. Luxury companies celebrate these few weeks for the holiday-like boost in sales they provide.\nBut China publicly condemns such corruption. When asked whether such gift-giving takes place, Chinese officials offer strong denials.\n\u201cWhere have you heard this crazy news?\u201d said Jiang Hongbo, a media relations official working with delegates from Heilongjiang Province in northeast China.\nYang Zhi, a liaison official from the Xinjiang region in far western China, was more indignant. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible we are busy sending gifts and hobnobbing with officials during such serious meetings?\u201d he said.\nPublicly, big luxury brands are tight-lipped about the practice of gift-giving in China. Louis Vuitton declined to comment this week, as did Salvatore Ferragamo. Many other leading brands did not return phone calls.\nJonathan Seliger, managing director in China for Dunhill, was circumspect when asked about purchases intended for government officials. \u201cDunhill has always been a popular brand among Chinese businessmen and government officials,\u201d he said.\nPrivately, however, marketing and sales executives and sales clerks at some of the leading brands offered a fascinating portrait of how bribery and corruption take place in China. Most of them insisted on anonymity because they did not want to offend their clients or jeopardize sales.\nUsually, they said, the purchases are charged to the account or credit card of a private businessman. \u201cWhen I first went to China I was fascinated because I always saw two guys going shopping,\u201d Ms. Chadha said. \u201cBut later I found that one is doing the shopping, and the other is paying.\u201d\nAccording to sales and marketing managers, in most cases a private entrepreneur coordinates with a public official\u2019s staff to set up accounts at luxury stores and sends the official, his family members and mistress code names to use for each store. If they shop at Louis Vuitton, for example, they need only give the code name and the purchases are charged to that account.\nThere are also middlemen who help buy the goods, whether the buyer is a government official buying for one of his superiors or a private businessmen seeking to influence an official.\nSales clerks at luxury stores quickly learn which products are popular with clients seeking to curry favor. \u201cJewelry is a favorite for people sending gifts to government officials,\u201d said a clerk at the Jimmy Choo luxury shop in Beijing, who declined to be identified to protect his job.\nMichael Ouyang, chief executive of the World Luxury Association China Office, said government officials \u201cwould rather wear luxury goods when playing golf.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be cautious at work,\u201d he said.\nWith the public increasingly aware of government corruption, there has been talk of creating a national register to track the family assets of all government officials, in the hopes of weeding out bribe-taking relatives.\nThe problem is that officials in China appear to be addicted to European luxury brands.\nIn January, a land confiscation official in the southwestern city of Chongqing was sentenced to 13 years in prison for accepting kickbacks. The government confiscated 200 pairs of luxury shoes, 100 luxury suits and a luxury car.\nAt his sentencing in January, the official, Ding Meng, expressed no remorse about his expensive tastes.\nHe even scolded the prosecutor for her poor taste in fashion. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman and you don\u2019t even wear better luxury shoes than me,\u201d he sniped. \u201cMaybe you can spend $25 and buy a tube of shoe cream.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/world/asia/14gifts.html", "title": "For Bribing Officials, Chinese Give the Best", "author": "DAVID BARBOZA"}
{"date": "Tue, 24 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 As they awaited their fates in holding cell No. 9 of the Puning County jail, Li Qiaoming and a half-dozen fellow inmates played \u201celude the cat,\u201d a Chinese hide-and-seek that might be better described as Marco Polo without the pool.\nMr. Li put on a blindfold, groped for quarry and soon was lying on the floor with a fatal head injury.\nThat, at least, is the story disseminated by the police in Yunnan Province, where Mr. Li, a 24-year-old farmer, lived and died this month after his arrest on charges of illegal logging.\nPublic reaction to the official explanation of Mr. Li\u2019s death was swift, and cynical. Thousands of Internet users surmised that Mr. Li had died from a beating by the police. Mistreatment of people in custody is not uncommon in China. But what happened next is.\nRather than suppress the accusations by erasing the Web postings, provincial officials invited the public to help solve the case. They sorted through 1,000 volunteers and picked a 15-member committee that would visit the scene of the crime, cull the evidence and \u201cdiscover the truth.\u201d\nThe results ultimately proved dispiriting to those who hoped for a thorough investigation of the police. But the case riveted the public and fueled a frank discussion online and in the state-run media about the extent \u2014 and the limits \u2014 of official attempts to shape popular opinion.\nIn explaining his motives for a citizen investigation, Wu Hao, an official in Yunnan\u2019s propaganda department, said he was hoping to restore the public\u2019s faith in a government that could be unresponsive and at times hostile to accusations of misconduct. In an interview with Chinese reporters this week, he acknowledged that the authorities could have easily quashed the debate by censoring the Internet or could have stonewalled the calls for justice.\n\u201cPast experience has shown that the doubts of the netizens will not shift or recede on their own over time,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, the doubts will actually rise.\u201d\nHis conclusion: \u201cA matter of Internet public opinion must be solved by Internet methods.\u201d\nAlthough the reaction to Mr. Wu\u2019s effort was initially favorable, it soured as the limits of the inquiry became apparent. When they arrived at the jail last Friday, the committee members were given access to the crime scene but were not allowed to view surveillance tapes, examine the autopsy report or question the guards on duty at the time.\nThey were also not permitted to interview the prime suspect, Pu Huayong, an inmate who the police said had been unhappy with the outcome of the \u201celude the cat\u201d game. The official police report said he kicked and punched Mr. Li, sending him headlong into a doorframe. Mr. Li died four days later.\nBut if the authorities thought they could quell public cynicism with newfound openness, they were disappointed. Soon after disclosing the identities of the \u201cvolunteers,\u201d Web users investigated their backgrounds, revealing that nearly all the \u201crandomly selected\u201d investigators were current or former employees of the state-run media. The team leader, Zhai Li, had previously worked as an \u201cInternet commentator,\u201d a euphemism for those who seek to shape public debate with pro-government postings.\nOver the past week, more than 70,000 postings accumulated on QQ.com, one of China\u2019s most popular bulletin boards, and many of the comments were less than sympathetic. \u201cThis kind of hide-and-seek investigation looks like an indignity to justice,\u201d read one typical posting.\nEven The Beijing News criticized the process as doomed from the start. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned two lessons from this case,\u201d it said. \u201cOne is that such inspections cannot solely rely on passion and idealism but on rational and pragmatic work. The second is that this has again exposed the flaws of the current system and that the need to establish an independent investigation system involving experts is urgent.\u201d\nIn the report they issued on Monday, committee members acknowledged that their inquiry had been hamstrung by officials claiming that it might compromise the police investigation. \u201cWe suddenly recognized that while netizens may be all powerful on the Internet, they are very much helpless in real life,\u201d said Mr. Zhai, the team leader.\nOn Tuesday, Gong Fei, a provincial official, defended what had become known as the \u201celude the cat\u201d episode, saying it represented a new chapter in grass-roots activism. \u201cIn the future we might still organize this kind of group to get involved in incidents, if allowed by law,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope the truth of all incidents in the future will be promptly and accurately released so no one has to be left guessing.\u201d\nHis exuberance, however, is apparently not widely shared. A poll sponsored by Sina.com, one of China\u2019s top Web portals, showed that as of Tuesday, 86 percent of respondents had said they still did not believe the police version of Mr. Li\u2019s death.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/world/asia/25china.html", "title": "China\u2019s Answer to a Crime Includes Amateur Sleuths", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}

{"date": "Thu, 22 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuela will press the Obama administration in the coming days to extradite a former senior official in Venezuela\u2019s secret intelligence police so that he can be tried for the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people, according to lawyers for the government here.\nThe move will test the new administration\u2019s willingness to engage on a festering issue that has further strained America\u2019s relations with Venezuela and Cuba. Both nations have depicted the case of Luis Posada Carriles, an elderly Cuban exile who is a naturalized Venezuelan and a former C.I.A. operative, as an example of hypocrisy by Washington in its fight against terrorism.\nMr. Posada, 80, is charged here with masterminding the bombing of a Cubana Airlines plane as it flew above Barbados, killing all 73 people on board, including dozens of Cuban civilians and a 9-year-old Guyanese girl. It was the Western Hemisphere\u2019s first act of midair terrorism, the bloodiest of a series of bombings aimed at weakening Fidel Castro\u2019s government.\nAt the time of the bombing, Mr. Posada was operating a private security firm here, after holding senior posts in Venezuela\u2019s intelligence police. He was imprisoned in Venezuela for nine years while facing charges of plotting the bombing with another Cuban exile, but escaped in 1985 to El Salvador aboard a shrimp boat.\nMr. Posada has lived freely in Miami since 2007, when a federal judge in Texas dismissed an indictment against him on immigration fraud charges. He had entered the United States from Mexico, and was detained for two years until his release. He now spends his days painting landscapes, which are sold by the dozens at shows in Miami frequented by a shrinking but powerful group of hardened anti-Castro exiles.\n\u201cThe Bush administration did not want to extradite Posada, because of its close ties to extremist elements in Miami that protect Posada,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Pertierra, a lawyer in Washington who represents Venezuela\u2019s government. \u201cWe are hopeful that the Obama administration will see the case differently.\u201d\nLaura Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in Washington, declined to comment on Venezuela\u2019s extradition request.\nVenezuela first submitted its request in 2005, when Mr. Posada appeared in Miami after being released from prison in Panama, where he had been convicted on charges of plotting to kill Mr. Castro. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has since taken a page from Mr. Castro\u2019s use of the case to criticize the United States for failing to extradite or imprison a militant implicated in the deaths of dozens of civilians.\nMr. Pertierra, the lawyer for Venezuela, said Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s government would now put forward additional evidence linking Mr. Posada to the bombing, including the scouting notes of Hern\u00e1n Ricardo, a Venezuelan employee of Mr. Posada\u2019s private security firm here at the time of the Cubana Airlines attack. The notes, which Venezuelan officials reportedly found in searches of Mr. Posada\u2019s home and office, show Mr. Ricardo\u2019s surveillance of Caribbean targets \u201cwith a link to Cuba\u201d for potential attacks, including the flight from Barbados. Several other attacks on targets described in the notes were carried out in 1976, including the bombing of the Guyanese Embassy in Trinidad.\nVenezuela is in the midst of a broad push to raise awareness of the airline bombing, which has been a defining element of public life in Cuba for three decades. A documentary, \u201cPosada Carriles: Terrorism Made in the U.S.A.,\u201d has been shown repeatedly on Venezuelan state television in recent weeks.\nAnd a new feature film about Mr. Posada financed by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s government is scheduled for release soon, according to its director, Eduardo Barberena. The thriller, starring Cuban actors, recounts Mr. Posada\u2019s time in the secret intelligence police and the bombing of Cubana Airlines Flight 455.\n\u201cWhat allows him to avoid his moral obligation?\u201d Mr. Barberena said of Mr. Posada\u2019s freedom.\nBut some with ties to Mr. Posada are far less sanguine about extraditing him to Venezuela. Joaqu\u00edn Chaffardet, a former business partner of Mr. Posada\u2019s and the former secretary general of the intelligence police, testified in the United States in 2005 that he believed Mr. Posada would be tortured or sent to Cuba if he were extradited to Venezuela.\nMr. Chaffardet, a lawyer, said his home was searched by military intelligence officials, and that his clients were hounded to abandon him around the time that Mr. Posada was released from detention in 2007. Mr. Chaffardet said in a telephone interview that he later left Venezuela for the United States.\n\u201cFrom my own experience, there is no rule of law in Venezuela, and certainly no assurance that Posada would not be subjected to inhumane treatment,\u201d said Mr. Chaffardet, who is listed by Venezuela\u2019s military intelligence service as one of the country\u2019s most wanted fugitives, accused of instigating military rebellion.\nMr. Pertierra, the lawyer for Venezuela, said officials were willing to provide the United States with written guarantees that no harm would come to Mr. Posada and that he would be given a fair trial.\nIn the United States, Mr. Posada still faces immigration charges, and a separate criminal case in New Jersey linking him to a bombing campaign in Cuba in the 1990s.\nStill, \u201cthere have been no indictments to my knowledge\u201d in the New Jersey case, said Arturo V. Hernandez, Mr. Posada\u2019s lawyer in Miami. Beyond that, Mr. Hernandez said he was appealing Mr. Posada\u2019s immigration case to the Supreme Court.\nRelations between Washington and Caracas, meanwhile, remain frayed. The United States Embassy here has had no ambassador since Mr. Ch\u00e1vez expelled the American envoy, Patrick Duddy, last September.\nAnd Mr. Ch\u00e1vez has already shown a willingness to insult Mr. Obama, saying he had the same \u201cstench\u201d as his predecessor after Mr. Obama expressed concern last week that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s government may have supported Colombia\u2019s FARC rebels, which are classified as terrorists by the United States.\n\u201cU.S. credibility on fighting terrorism makes it imperative for the new administration to move the Posada case toward justice,\u201d said Peter Kornbluh, a Cuba specialist at the National Security Archive, an organization at George Washington University that has released documents on Mr. Posada, including the 1976 scouting notes. But Mr. Kornbluh added, \u201cThe sorry state of U.S.-Venezuelan relations will make it politically difficult for even an Obama administration to put an extradition of Posada to Caracas at the top of the agenda.\u201d\nAnother option for the Obama administration that may arise is to extradite Mr. Posada to Panama, where the Supreme Court last year overturned the pardon he received from then-President Mireya Moscoso in 2004. That court ruling has opened a debate in Panama over requesting Mr. Posada\u2019s extradition so that he can finish his prison term there. \u201cWith Obama, we hope that a cleansing of the past can take place,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Marrero, 62, a former guerrilla in Venezuela who claims he was tortured by the nation\u2019s intelligence police under Mr. Posada\u2019s supervision.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/world/americas/23venez.html", "title": "Venezuela Will Push U.S. to Hand Over Man Tied to Plane Bombing", "author": "SIMON ROMERO and DAMIEN CAVE"}
{"date": "Mon, 14 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 American commandos killed one of the most wanted Islamic militants in Africa in a daylight raid in southern Somalia on Monday, according to American and Somali officials, an indication of the Obama administration\u2019s willingness to use combat troops strategically against Al Qaeda\u2019s growing influence in the region.\nWestern intelligence agents have described the militant, Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, as the ringleader of a Qaeda cell in Kenya responsible for the bombing of an Israeli hotel on the Kenyan coast in 2002. Mr. Nabhan may have also played a role in the attacks on two American embassies in East Africa in 1998.\nAmerican military forces have been hunting him for years, and on Monday, around 1 p.m., villagers near the town of Baraawe said four military helicopters suddenly materialized over the horizon and shot at two trucks rumbling through the desert.\nThe trucks were carrying leaders of the Shabab, an Islamist extremist group fighting to overthrow Somalia\u2019s weak but internationally recognized government. The Shabab work hand-in-hand with foreign terrorists, according to Western and Somali agents, and in the past few months, as the battle for control of Somalia has intensified, the group seems to be drawing increasingly close to Al Qaeda.\nAmerican officials on Monday provided few details, but confirmed that Special Operations forces, operating from a nearby American warship, participated in the helicopter raid.\nUnder the administration of President George W. Bush, the American military used long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles and AC-130 gunships to carry out strikes against terrorism suspects in Somalia. One American adviser said the decision to use commandos and not long-range missiles in this case may reflect a shift by the Obama administration to go to greater lengths to avoid civilian deaths. In the past, many Somali villagers have been killed by American missiles.\nBut urgency was a major, if not overriding, factor as well. A senior American military official said the Special Operations forces, who had kept Mr. Nabhan under lengthy surveillance waiting for the right moment to strike, acted quickly after tracking Mr. Nabhan to a location away from civilians on Monday. \u201cWe have been watching him for a long, long time,\u201d said the military official.\nDespite the danger of conducting the mission during the day, the strategy ensured that the troops could more accurately identify their target, attack it and confirm the deaths afterward. \u201cThis approach was, \u2018Let\u2019s do it very quickly, very swiftly and confirm he\u2019s gone,\u2019 \u201d the adviser said.\nMr. Nabhan played an increasingly important role as a senior instructor for new militant recruits, including some Americans, as well as a liaison to senior Qaeda leaders in Pakistan, the senior American adviser said.\n\u201cThis is very significant because it takes away a person who\u2019s been a main conduit between the East Africa extremists and big Al Qaeda,\u201d said the adviser, who like several United States officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the mission.\nThe helicopters, with commandos firing .50-caliber machine guns and other automatic weapons, quickly disabled the trucks, according to villagers in the area, and several of the Shabab fighters tried to fire back. Shabab leaders said that six foreign fighters, including Mr. Nabhan, were quickly killed, along with three Somali Shabab. The helicopters landed, and the commandos inspected the wreckage and carried away the bodies of Mr. Nabhan and the other fighters for identification, a senior American military official said.\n\u201cWe are very upset, very upset,\u201d said a Shabab official from the town of Merka, near where the raid happened. \u201cThis is a big loss for us.\u201d\nMr. Nabhan, who was thought to be around 30 years old and of Yemeni descent, was born in Mombasa, on Kenya\u2019s coast. American intelligence sources have said that he masterminded the suicide bombing of the Paradise hotel in Mombasa, which killed 11 Kenyans and 3 Israelis and wounded dozens of others.\nThe Paradise was a popular Israeli hangout, complete with a kosher restaurant and synagogue. That same day, Nov. 28, 2002, a group of assailants fired several missiles at an Israeli passenger jet at the Mombasa airport, narrowly missing it. Intelligence agents said Mr. Nabhan helped fire the missiles.\nMr. Nabhan was one of the handful of Qaeda terrorists hiding out in Somalia for years, taking advantage of the country\u2019s chaos to elude agents pursuing them.\nMr. Nabhan was believed to be a close associate of Fazul Abdullah Mohamed, Al Qaeda\u2019s East Africa operations chief, who helped organize the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which killed more than 200 people. American military forces have tried to kill Mr. Nabhan and Mr. Mohamed with airstrikes several times in recent years.\nThe Baraawe area, like much of southern Somalia, is controlled by the Shabab. There is increasing evidence that foreign jihadists, like Mr. Nabhan, are leading Somali Shabab and training them in suicide bombs.\nAmerican officials said Mr. Nabhan\u2019s death is likely to send other suspects scurrying for cover. When they resurface, there may be killings of those suspected of being informants, sowing further turmoil in their ranks, American officials said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/world/africa/15raid.html", "title": "U.S. Kills Top Qaeda Militant in Southern Somalia", "author": "JEFFREY GETTLEMAN and ERIC SCHMITT"}
{"date": "Wed, 31 Dec 2008 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistani authorities have obtained confessions from members of the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba that they were involved in the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November that killed more than 160 people, a Pakistani official said.\nThe confessions are sure to put pressure on Pakistan\u2019s leaders; senior Pakistani officials have repeatedly complained in recent weeks that India had not provided them evidence of Pakistani complicity.\nAmerican and British officials \u2014 and Indian investigators \u2014 have said for weeks that their intelligence clearly points to the involvement of Lashkar in the Mumbai attacks. That evidence has been deeply uncomfortable for Pakistan, whose premier spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, helped create, finance and train Lashkar in the 1980s to fight a proxy war against Indian forces in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir.\nBut now, after weeks of stonewalling, it also seems clear that Pakistan may use its investigation to make the case that the Mumbai attackers were not part of a conspiracy carried out with the spy agency, known as the ISI, but that the militants were operating on their own and outside the control of government agents.\nThe most talkative of the senior Lashkar leaders being interrogated is said to be Zarrar Shah, the Pakistani official said. American intelligence officials say they believe that Mr. Shah, the group\u2019s communications chief, has served as a conduit between Lashkar and the ISI. His close ties to the agency and his admission of involvement in the attacks are sure to be unsettling for the government and its spy agency.\nAn operational leader of Lashkar, Zaki ur-Rehman Lakhvi, is also said to be cooperating with investigators. News of Mr. Shah\u2019s confession was reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cThese guys showed no remorse,\u201d said the Pakistani official. \u201cThey were bragging. They didn\u2019t need to be pushed, tortured or waterboarded\u201d into making their statements.\nThe confessions made no mention of any involvement by the Pakistani government, said the official, who added, \"They talk about people acting on their own.\u201d\nThough Pakistani authorities announced that the men had been detained in the first week of December, the official declined to say how long it took for them to confess their role in the Mumbai siege. The official also declined to specify how many confessions had been obtained, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just one confession.\u201d\nThe details of which security officials were carrying out the interrogations, where the suspects were being detained and whether they faced any charges all remained murky, and other Pakistani officials declined to discuss the matter or to confirm the Pakistani official\u2019s account.\nA government spokesman deflected direct questions about Pakistani complicity in the attacks and about the confessions by Lashkar members. \u201cThe idea that a person has spilled the beans while India has not even shared evidence with us seems far-fetched,\u201d said Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan.\nBut Indian officials and other skeptics are sure to question how seriously interrogations by Pakistani security officials could be expected to examine any possible role by the ISI in the attacks.\nAmerican intelligence officials say they believe that links remain between Lashkar and the ISI, and that the spy agency has helped support the militant group for the past several years by sharing intelligence and providing protection.\nBut American officials say they also believe that the spy agency has become more careful to mask its ties with militants since this summer, when American officials accused the spy agency of involvement in the bombing of the Indian Embassy in Afghanistan.\nOne Lashkar fighter who left the group several years ago said in an interview that the agency was directly involved in planning operations in the disputed Kashmir region. The agency\u2019s officers were \u201cat the table\u201d as missions were being sketched out, the former Lashkar fighter said.\nHowever, an active member of Lashkar said in an interview that relations with Pakistani security forces had grown cold. \u201cWe always had to hide from the Indian military, but now we have to hide from the Pakistani military as well,\u201d he said.\nThe ISI has always been a powerful and semiautonomous agency, and its top officers have maintained strong links to Islamist militants. There is some hope that the appointment three months ago of a new spy chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, who previously oversaw military operations against militants in Pakistan\u2019s lawless western districts, signaled a move away from sympathies with the Islamist fighters who control much of the region bordering Afghanistan.\nMr. Zardari told President Bush during a telephone call on Wednesday that his government would \u201cnot allow its territory to be used by nonstate actors for launching attacks on other countries\u201d and that \u201canybody found involved in such attacks from the soil of Pakistan will be dealt with sternly,\u201d according to Pakistan\u2019s state news agency.\nDespite the official assurances, some Pakistani officials appeared open to the idea that Pakistani militants carried out the operation. Mahmud Ali Durrani, the national security adviser, said in an interview broadcast on Tuesday that it \u201ccould be\u201d that some or all of the Mumbai attackers were Pakistanis.\nOne reason that Indian government officials have refused to provide substantive evidence so far, the Pakistani official said, is because they \u201care scared their intelligence methods will be discovered\u201d by their Pakistani rivals.\nIndian officials have shared evidence with the United States and certain other governments, but they have not permitted that information to be shared with Pakistan, said one Western official.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/world/asia/01pstan.html", "title": "Pakistani Militants Admit Role in Siege, Official Says", "author": "RICHARD A.

Its center lay 110 miles west and a little south of Cabo San Lucas, the resort at the peninsula\u2019s tip that is a favorite haunt of Hollywood celebrities.\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami forecast on Tuesday afternoon that Jimena would skirt the western coast of the peninsula as it moved north and slightly west through the end of the week. But the center warned that the increasing rainfall \u2014 between 5 and 10 inches across the southern half of Baja and parts of western Mexico \u2014 \u201ccould cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\u201d\nLuis Armando Di\u00e1z, the government secretary for the state of Baja California Sur, told reporters after a noon meeting of the state\u2019s civil protection council that some 10,000 people lived in areas that were at risk for flooding or mudslides. Five thousand people had been evacuated and 2,000 of them were staying in shelters.\nSince Monday, officials have been urging the residents of the shantytowns perched on the hills of Los Cabos, as the area is known, to move to safety.

The national police, however, put the number of protesters at 1.2 million.\nThe largest unions said in a statement that Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s response to the financial crisis had been inadequate, and they called on the government to do more to safeguard jobs and to improve workers\u2019 purchasing power.\n\u201cSalaried workers won\u2019t any longer accept being the victims of this crisis, which they had nothing to do with,\u201d said Bernard Thibault, secretary of the workers\u2019 confederation, BFM Radio reported.\nMr. Sarkozy, who was in Brussels at a European Union meeting, did not comment on the demonstrations.\nAlthough France has a long tradition of strikes and demonstrations by public unions, the protesters who marched on Thursday and during similar protests on Jan. 29 came from both the public and private sectors, union officials said. Some union leaders called the protests in late January, in which they said an estimated 2.5 million people had participated, the largest nationwide demonstrations in 20 years.\nBut some political analysts played down the potential effect of the strike. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a concrete political impact,\u201d said Zaki La\u00efdi, a professor of political science at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques in Paris.\nFrance faces mounting dissatisfaction amid rising unemployment.

{"date": "Fri, 13 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISTANBUL \u2014 After months of dialogue, the Turkish government announced a plan on Friday to help end the quarter-century-long conflict with a Kurdish separatist movement that has cost more than 40,000 lives.\nThe plan will be debated by Parliament, but the fact that it is being discussed at all is considered to be a landmark. For decades, Kurdish political parties were routinely banned, and the ethnic identity of the Kurds was not openly acknowledged, though they make up almost 15 percent of Turkey\u2019s population.\nThe government\u2019s plan would allow the Kurdish language to be used in all broadcast media and political campaigns, and restore Kurdish names to cities and towns that have been given Turkish ones. It would also establish a committee to fight discrimination.\n\u201cToday is the beginning of a new timeline and a fresh start,\u201d Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a live televised speech. \u201cWe took a courageous step to resolve chronic issues that constitute an obstacle along Turkey\u2019s development, progression and empowerment, and we are very sincere.\u201d\nLast year, Parliament approved private Kurdish language courses and a public television channel in Kurdish, as part of what it called a democracy package. And this week, a regulation took effect allowing Kurdish prisoners to communicate with visitors in their native language.\nSuch measures, many of which have been required for entry to the European Union, were inconceivable in the early 1980s, when aggressive state policies prohibited use of the Kurdish language and other cultural and political rights for the Kurds. That helped empower the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, known as the P.K.K., which presented itself as the defender of Kurdish rights.\nThe group, which has been fighting in the predominantly Kurdish southeast, has lost much of its popular support in recent years because of its violent methods. But it still has 12,000 militants hiding in northern Iraq along the Turkish border.\nThe P.K.K. praised the government\u2019s efforts but called for an immediate end to operations against it. Listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, the group says it no longer seeks independence, but demands constitutional recognition of Kurdish identity.\nShort of that, a blanket amnesty for militants could persuade the group to lay down arms, many Kurdish intellectuals say, a move the governing Justice and Development Party rejects.\nTurkey\u2019s leading opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, denounces any direct or indirect contact with the P.K.K., though it agrees on cultural rights for Kurds as long as they agree to be identified as Turkish citizens and are educated in Turkish.\n\u201cThe world recognizes us as Turks, not as an ethnicity but as a nation,\u201d said Deniz Baykal, the opposition party\u2019s chairman. \u201cNeither the E.U. regulations nor international human rights conventions foresee separate state structures and separate language education for each and every ethnic group. There\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d\nThe opposition\u2019s view resonates among other parties in Parliament, which argue that enshrining various ethnic identities in the Constitution would pave the way for independent states within Turkey and destroy unity.\nWhat almost everyone agrees upon is that the current Constitution, which was drafted after a military coup in 1980 and is seen as the source of many antidemocratic policies, needs to be replaced.\nBut the government promises that its first three articles \u2014 which explicitly recognize \u201cTurkishness\u201d as the national identity, and Turkish as the official language \u2014 will remain unchanged.\nFor Kurdish intellectuals like Sezgin Tanrikulu, former head of the bar association in Diyarbakir, the largest Kurdish town, the debate in Parliament was an achievement in its own right.\n\u201cThe Turkish Republic is confronting its past and ready to make a new start, which is more important than any specific measure,\u201d Mr. Tanrikulu said. \u201cSuch a government attitude would also discourage the P.K.K. from holding on to arms from now on.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/world/europe/14kurds.html", "title": "Turkey Plans to Ease Restrictions on Kurds and Help End Decades of Conflict", "author": "SEBNEM ARSU"}

Ansar al-Islam has roots in the country\u2019s Kurdish region and has been blamed for suicide bombings throughout the country.\n\u201cHe is also believed to have facilitated the movement of terrorists across the borders of Iraq,\u201d the statement read.\nThe Iraqi military had no comment about the arrest, even though the statement said the raid had been conducted by units of the Mosul Special Weapons and Tactics team and Iraqi Army soldiers, along with \u201ccoalition advisers.\u201d\nOn June 30, United States combat forces departed Iraq\u2019s urban areas as part of the American military\u2019s negotiated drawdown in Iraq.\nIn the weeks since, many Iraqi commanders have interpreted that to mean that all American troop movements, other than logistics and force protection missions, require prior approval from the Iraqi military. That has led to some friction between American and Iraqi units.\nIn Diyala Province, for instance, the provincial police commander ordered police stations closed to American troops, resulting in the cancellation of training visits for several weeks.\nA recent memo from Col. Timothy R. Reese, the chief American adviser to Iraqi forces in Baghdad, complained that one consequence of the withdrawal was that Iraqi units \u201care far less likely to want to conduct combined combat operations with U.S. forces, to go after targets the U.S. considers high value.\u201d\nDespite that, joint patrols and operations continue in many parts of the country, although with much less frequency than before June 30.\nAlso Tuesday, the Iraqi government announced that it had arrested a 25-year-old man in the slaying of an Iraqi television journalist in 2006.\nThe man, Yasser Mohammed Hamad al-Takhi, 25, was shown on Iraqi television in a videotaped confession describing how he and three other men, including one of his brothers, had set up a checkpoint on a road outside the city of Samarra to stop a car carrying the journalist, Atwar Bahjat, and two members of her crew.\nMr. Takhi said he had been working for a Sunni armed group with ties to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a homegrown insurgent group that American intelligence agencies say has some foreign leadership.\nMs. Bahjat, a journalist working for Al Arabiya, a satellite television station based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, had been returning to Baghdad after having covered the bombing of a Shiite shrine in Samarra, an event that pushed Iraq into sectarian warfare.\nSpeaking calmly and looking directly into the camera, Mr. Takhi said his gang had stopped Ms. Bahjat\u2019s car and ordered her to get into the gang\u2019s vehicle.\nHe did not say why the gang had made the reporter their target, but at the time, journalists were frequently killed and kidnapped by Sunni and Shiite armed groups in Iraq.\nThe gang drove to a side street, followed by a car driven by another member of the gang. Inside the second car were Adnan Abdallah and Khaled Mohsen, the television station\u2019s other employees.\n\u201cI got in the car and told Atwar that she was beautiful, that I liked the way she looked and I would like to have fun with her,\u201d Mr. Takhi said. \u201cShe answered that it was not her job. I told her it is not up to you.\u201d\nMr. Takhi said he raped Ms. Bahjat at gunpoint inside the car. He then shot her in the neck, head and chest.\nAnother member of the gang fatally shot Mr. Abdallah and Mr. Mohsen. The gang filmed the crimes, he said, though it was not clear what happened to the tape.\nPortions of the televised confession were edited to spare the family details of her rape, said Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, an Iraqi Army spokesman.\nGeneral Atta said Mr. Takhi\u2019s brother had been arrested earlier, and had admitted to his role in the crime.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/world/middleeast/05iraq.html", "title": "U.S. Says Sunni Insurgent Leader Was Arrested During Raids in Northern Iraq", "author": "TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and ROD NORDLAND"}

Putin, at Europe\u2019s premier song contest.\nThe title of the song, sung in accented English, is \u201cWe Don\u2019t Wanna Put In,\u201d a barely successful play on words involving the Russian prime minister\u2019s name.\nThe song, by a Georgian group called Stephane and 3G, was chosen by popular vote on Wednesday as Georgia\u2019s entry for Eurovision, the megapopular and kitschy European song contest that will be hosted by Moscow in May.\nGeorgia was planning to boycott this year\u2019s event to protest Russia\u2019s de facto annexation of two Georgian separatist regions after the August war, but it apparently settled on taking a musical swipe at Mr. Putin right in the Russian capital.\nThe news has already begun to excite patriotic passions in Russia, where anti-Georgian sentiment remains high after the war, which many in Russia believe Georgia started.\n\u201cIn my opinion, this is amoral,\u201d Yana Rudkovskaya, the Russian producer for Dima Bilan, last year\u2019s Eurovision winner, told the Echo Moskvy radio station. \u201cI think that the Eurovision board and the heads of Channel One should forbid this song because it insults our country.\u201d\nThe state-controlled Channel One will broadcast the competition live. If Georgia makes it to the final round, it is unclear how the station will handle such an affront to Mr. Putin, who receives little but fawning coverage by Russian federal television.\nStephane Mgebrishvili, the Georgian group\u2019s front man, said he and his three female bandmates had hoped for this kind of resonance when they came up with the song, which he referred to as a \u201cmarketing trick.\u201d\n\u201cThe most important thing for us was to create the project that would attract as much attention as possible,\u201d said Mr. Mgebrishvili, a slight man of 29 who in a YouTube video performs the tune in a large black wig with sideburns as his three bandmates dance in spandex and hot pants to a disco beat that evokes \u201cSaturday Night Fever.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t wanna put in / the negative mood / is killin\u2019 the groove,\u201d goes the chorus.\nMr. Mgebrishvili, who participated in street protests against Russia in Tbilisi during the August war, said his group received \u201cmoral support\u201d from some government ministers.\nDmitri Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, called the song \u201chooliganism\u201d and told the Ria Novosti news agency that he thought it unfortunate that Georgia would use the song competition to \u201cpromote pseudopolitical ambitions.\u201d\nIt is not the first time former Soviet republics have used the song contest to take pop-music potshots at Russia.\nThe Ukrainian pop star Verka Serduchka, a flamboyant middle-aged drag queen, ruffled not a few feather boas in Russia with her 2007 Eurovision performance of \u201cDancing Lasha Tumbai,\u201d a nonsensical phrase that many \u2014 to the apparent surprise of the artist \u2014 interpreted as \u201cRussia goodbye.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/world/europe/22georgia.html", "title": "Georgia Offers Sideburns and a Disco Beat as Payback for a War", "author": "OLESYA VARTANYAN and MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ"}
{"date": "Mon, 23 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 The American military marked another milestone the other day in the initiative perhaps most responsible for taming the violence in Iraq: All but 10,000 of the 94,000 Sunni militiamen \u2014 many of them former insurgents who agreed, for cash, to stop killing American soldiers \u2014 had been turned over to the control of the Iraqi military.\nSignificantly, the militiamen themselves were not celebrating.\nThe same day, one group of the fighters north of Baghdad announced they were resigning from their Awakening Council, the Iraqi name for what the Americans call the Sons of Iraq. And in the town of Salman Pak, councils in southern Baghdad and its suburbs, an area once called \u201cthe ring of death,\u201d met to denounce Iraqi efforts to integrate them.\nThese are among the signs that the fighters\u2019 patience is fraying badly at a difficult moment. After months of promises, only 5,000 Awakening members \u2014 just over 5 percent \u2014 have been given permanent jobs in the Iraqi security forces. Those promises were made last year when Iraq was flush with oil money.\nNow with Iraq\u2019s budget battered by falling oil prices, the government is having trouble paying existing employees, much less bringing in Sunni gunmen already regarded with suspicion by the Shiite-led government.\nIn interviews with leaders from a dozen local Awakening Councils, nearly all complained that full-time jobs were lacking, that pay was in arrears and that members were being arrested despite promises of amnesty.\nPerhaps most ominously, many expressed concern this might drive some followers back to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a largely Iraqi group with some foreign leadership, at a time when both Iraqi and American military commanders say that the group seems to be making gains, small but worrisome, around Baghdad.\nThe complaints are not completely new, as Awakening members bargained for power and cash, but the threat to rejoin the insurgency has grown more fervent as more time has passed without government jobs.\n\u201cUntil now, promises are all we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d said Adil al-Mashhadani, a leader of the Awakening Council in the Fadhil neighborhood in Baghdad, where 12 of the 180 members have been able to join the police. \u201cWhen the government does not even pay them enough to stay alive, Qaeda and armed groups are ready to pay them generously.\u201d\nMaj. Gen. Mike Ferriter, deputy operations commander of the American-led forces, gave a press briefing at Camp Victory Saturday at which he declared the Awakening \u201cthe leading edge of reconciliation.\u201d He added, \u201cI predict success.\u201d\nAt the same time, he conceded that in the past year, only 5,000 fighters had been integrated into the Iraqi security forces, mostly in the police. That is well short of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\u2019s pledge to bring 20 percent of them into the police. Mr. Maliki also pledged that the other 80 percent would get jobs in other government ministries.\nCoinciding with the American military\u2019s \u201csurge\u201d over the last two years, the Awakening movement is given broad credit for helping quell most of the violence in Sunni communities.\nThe program was never meant to be permanent, however; the idea always was to find them jobs and bring Sunnis into the security services and government.\nGeneral Ferriter said he was not concerned about the low number integrated so far, predicting that all 94,000 members would have government jobs by the end of this year. He said that so far, 3,000 jobs had been promised by the Health Ministry, 10,000 by the Education Ministry and 500 by the Oil Ministry.\nBut other American officials are not so sure, given the far weaker financial condition of the Iraqi government because of falling oil prices. \u201cDo we really think the Iraqi government is going to bring 100,000 new employees in at a time when their revenue stream is taking a nosedive?\u201d asked an American military official knowledgeable about the program, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\u201cYou have to realize the Iraqi government may have an S.O.I. transition program, but Al Qaeda and all those groups have their own S.O.I. transition program,\u201d the officer said, using the abbreviation for the Sons of Iraq.\nNo one has ever doubted that many of the recipients of the American money were once insurgents, some aligned with Al Qaeda at one time. Essentially, they were paid to change sides. They have paid a price: More than 500 were killed in the fighting that ousted Al Qaeda from their neighborhoods and villages in 2007 and 2008.\nNow they continue to be the victims of assassinations by extremists, most recently on Monday, when an Awakening leader in Abu Ghraib was killed.\nThe Awakening members\u2019 willingness to lose their lives fighting Al Qaeda gradually persuaded Iraqi leaders around Mr. Maliki to soften their distrust and to bring these local fighters into the fold. Many Awakening leaders praised Mr. Maliki, but said other factions in the Iraqi government were undercutting his efforts.\n\u201cThe Iraqi Army considers us members of Al Qaeda, not Awakening Council leaders,\u201d said Sheik Awad al-Harbousi, who lost a son, a father and four other close relatives to Al Qaeda, and who still leads the council in Taji, just north of Baghdad. \u201cWe sacrificed to kick out Al Qaeda, and this is their thank-you?\u201d\nHe said his members voted Saturday to leave the Awakening movement, though they would keep their posts. \u201cThis is a message to the prime minister,\u201d he said, suggesting that the move was only symbolic so far.\nThe United States military says that only 164 Sons of Iraq members have been arrested in the past year, \u201cmany of them for good reason,\u201d said Col. Jeffrey Kulmayer, who runs the program under General Ferriter.\nAwakening members, however, complain that the real number is much higher. Mahmood Abdullah al-Jbouri, security chief for the Awakening Council in Madaen, said in that district, there were arrest warrants out for hundreds of Awakening members, \u201cincluding me.\u201d He was in hiding and reached by telephone.\nThe Awakening members have a strong practical motive for seeking government positions. Their pay, which ranges from $250 to $300 per month, is less than half that of police officers and soldiers. Police officers earn $600 per month, and soldiers about $750, plus benefits.\nEven that meager pay is often late. Of the seven Awakening Councils contacted in Diyala and Baghdad, where the Iraqi Army is the Awakening Councils\u2019 paymaster, six reported that their pay was overdue by as much as two months.\nAn Iraqi government official said the pay problem was temporary, because of the delay in enacting a new budget. \u201cThe Iraqi government will deal faithfully with the Awakening Councils,\u201d said Zuhair al-Chalabi, a member of the reconciliation committee in the prime minister\u2019s office.\nThe American official also blamed \u201cbureaucratic confusions\u201d for the payroll delays. \u201cThere are problems,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a crisis yet.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/world/middleeast/24sunni.html", "title": "Sunni Fighters Say Iraq Didn\u2019t Keep Job Promises", "author": "ROD NORDLAND and ALISSA J.

All they are doing is hitting the houses.\u201d\nHe and other civilians caught in the operation, just in its fourth day, were already complaining of heavy-handed tactics by the Pakistani military, which has little training in counterinsurgency.\nA military spokesman claimed steady progress in the operation but also said the militants were putting up fierce resistance.\nThe civilian complaints and the Taliban resistance pointed to the difficult task ahead for the military in driving the militants from Buner, a district just 60 miles from the capital, where hundreds of Taliban fighters advanced last week, setting off alarm here and abroad.\nTrying to revive a peace accord with the Taliban from February, government officials restarted talks with Maulana Sufi Muhammad, the religious cleric who helped mediate the deal.\nThe provincial government said it was committed to appointing Islamic judges as part of the deal covering the Swat Valley and Buner. Maulana Muhammad, despite his protest at the military operation, promised the militants would lay down their weapons once Islamic law was in force.\nBut in what is clearly a two-pronged approach by the Pakistani authorities, military operations also intensified.\nThe military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said forces had succeeded in opening up access from the west to Buner\u2019s central town of Daggar and were close to linking up from the south after heavy fighting at the Ambela Pass.\nAt least 55 militants had been killed in fighting in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total killed so far to more than 100, he said. Two members of the paramilitary Frontier Corps were killed and eight wounded in a house rigged with explosives, he said.\nMilitants were using antiaircraft weapons mounted on cars and recoilless rifles, and army helicopters had focused attacks on militants in cars and motorcycles on the roads.\nYet accounts from people fleeing the region said that civilians were being caught up in the fighting in Ambela and on the roads. Taliban militants had strong positions in the hills and could still resist the military advance, they said.\nVillagers traveled on foot and along country roads to reach this village in the neighboring district of Swabi on Friday, their belongings piled on small vans with women and children, and even cows, packed together inside.\nOfficials from Al Khidmat Foundation, a religious humanitarian organization assisting the families, said more than a thousand vehicles had ferried families out in just one day.\nIn one house that was hit, two children died, a woman lost both legs, and a man was so seriously wounded that the family had already dug his grave and were waiting for him to die, Mr. Bakht, the farmer, said.\nThree men, who tried to drive toward the military to ask them to stop firing on the houses, were also killed when a helicopter fired rockets on their car, Mr. Bakht said.

{"date": "Sat, 05 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PERUGIA, Italy \u2014 Tensions and cultural misunderstandings ran high on Saturday after an American college student was found guilty here of murdering her British housemate.\nRather than clarifying the saga of what prosecutors said was a sex game gone fatally awry, the conviction on Saturday of Amanda Knox, 22, a Seattle college student, for killing her roommate, Meredith Kercher, 21, seemed only to heighten the conflicting public opinions voiced in two years of fierce international news coverage.\nAs the yearlong trial unfolded in the media as much as in the courts, Ms. Knox was often depicted in the United States as an innocent abroad, a fresh-faced young woman caught in the vagaries of the Italian justice system.\nYet in the Italian press, she was a blithe, dope-smoking party girl who had accused a former boss, Patrick Lumumba, of the crime before changing her story. (She later said the police had pressed her to accuse him.) On Saturday, she was also found guilty of defaming Mr. Lumumba, whose lawyer called her a \u201clittle she-devil\u201d in closing arguments last week.\nThe trial also tapped into longstanding town-and-gown tensions in Perugia, where residents blame foreign students like Ms. Knox for helping transform the picturesque city into a pub crawl.\nThe Knox family insisted Saturday that this cultural clash and the concern with the gossipy details of Amanda\u2019s personal life obscured the focus on what really happened on Nov. 2, 2007.\n\u201cIt appears clear to us that the attacks on Amanda\u2019s character in much of the media and by the prosecution had a significant impact on the judges and jurors and apparently overshadowed the lack of evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case against her,\u201d the family said in a statement.\nThe family vowed to continue its campaign to free Ms. Knox. Asked if they would appeal, her father, Curt Knox, replied, with tears in his eyes, \u201cHell, yes.\u201d\nMs. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, and her Italian former boyfriend, 25-year-old Raffaele Sollecito, to 25 years. A third defendant, Rudy Guede, 22, is appealing a 30-year sentence for sexual assault and murder. He has admitted that he was at the house the night of the murder, and his DNA was found on Ms. Kercher\u2019s body.\nFor many in Britain and the United States, what was on trial here was Italian justice.\nIn a statement after the verdict was delivered early Saturday, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said, \u201cI have serious questions about the Italian justice system and whether anti-Americanism tainted this trial.\u201d She added, \u201cThe prosecution did not present enough evidence for an impartial jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Knox was guilty.\u201d\nMs. Kercher\u2019s family saw it differently. Relatives, who held a rare and sober news conference here on Saturday, expressed satisfaction with the verdicts.\n\u201cUltimately we are pleased with the decision, pleased that we\u2019ve got a decision, but it\u2019s not a time for celebration, it\u2019s not a moment of triumph,\u201d said Lyle Kercher, the victim\u2019s brother.\nAnother brother, John Kercher Jr., added, \u201cHer presence is missed every time we meet up as a family.\u201d\nAsked if they were convinced by the verdict, Ms. Kercher\u2019s mother, Arline, said, \u201cYou have to go on the evidence, because there is nothing else.\u201d\nProsecutors used both forensic and circumstantial evidence against Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito, whose defense lawyers failed to persuade the jury.\nBeyond the atmospherics, Italian legal experts said, the case appeared to have been deliberated on the merits. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the longer the trial, the longer the pain, but it also means that there can be an in-depth analysis of the facts,\u201d said Michele Ainis, an expert in Italian constitutional law. \u201cI hope that happened.\u201d\n\u201cOur justice system is certainly in rough shape,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it has a lot of self-correcting mechanisms.\u201d\nIn the Italian system, the end of this yearlong trial closes only the first chapter. Unlike in the American system, in which appeals center on issues of law, not fact, in the Italian system, appeals are automatic and defendants can ask to retry the entire case in a first round of appeals.\nFrom there, the case can go to Italy\u2019s highest court, which is required to hear every appeal.\nIt may be years before a definitive sentence is reached.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/europe/06perugia.html", "title": "Verdict in Italy, but American\u2019s Case Isn\u2019t Over", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}
{"date": "Fri, 09 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Seo Ji-won was supposed to have been in Sydney, Australia, by now, pursuing her dream of a doctoral degree and higher-paying jobs. Instead, the 26-year-old South Korean engineering graduate remains home in Seoul, working part time at a coffee shop, largely because of forces beyond her control.\nThe global financial crisis has hammered confidence in South Korea\u2019s once-booming economy, decimating the value of its currency, the won, and forcing tens of thousands of students to alter their study plans, or cancel them altogether.\nFor Ms. Seo, the won\u2019s plunge in value by a third just in the last few months drove up the cost of her four-year degree program by $10,000, far beyond her savings.\n\u201cI like to say that I\u2019m in pause mode,\u201d Ms. Seo said. \u201cMy future depends on the won going back up.\u201d\nIn recent years, studying abroad has become de rigueur for competitive students in this education-obsessed nation. As the growing economy raised living standards and strengthened the won, increasing numbers of parents sent their children overseas to learn English and earn prestigious foreign degrees, hoping to help them gain a leg up in South Korea\u2019s intensely competitive job market, or to help them escape from its high-pressure education system.\nAccording to Education Ministry officials, about 350,000 South Korean students went abroad in 2007, most of them university-age but some in elementary school and even kindergarten. South Koreans have become the largest group of foreign students in the United States, according to American government statistics, outnumbering even those from China, with a population much larger than South Korea\u2019s 48 million people.\n\u201cThe strong won made overseas education become affordable, perhaps too affordable, for more South Koreans,\u201d said Choi Won-seok, an executive director at uhak.com, an agency based in Seoul that helps students study abroad. \u201cKorea experienced a study-abroad bubble.\u201d\nNow there are early signs that the bubble may be deflating.\nIn October, the Education Ministry said the number of elementary and secondary students going abroad fell in the first half of 2008 for the first time since the government started keeping count a decade ago. In a separate report, the central bank said spending on overseas education fell by 5.8 percent in the same period from the year before to $2.3 billion, the largest decline since the 1997 Asian financial crisis.\nWhile job security and the overall slowing of the economy play a role, the biggest factor has been the rapidly falling won, education experts and students say. The currency\u2019s drop from a peak of nearly 900 per dollar in mid-2008 to about 1,360 per dollar now translates to a 50 percent price increase in foreign goods \u2014 like tuition, room and board, and airfare \u2014 in just a few months.\nTo be sure, Mr. Choi and others say, many South Koreans seeking advanced degrees, especially at top American or European universities, are likely to go anyway.\nHowever, a larger number of students enroll in short-term, often one-year programs, to study English or other languages. Last year, some 150,000 South Koreans went abroad for this kind of study. This year, the number is likely to fall by 30 percent to 40 percent, Mr. Choi said.\nSome of those forced to abandon their plans fear the decision could hurt their prospects.\nKang Youn-mo, a 24-year-old French major, canceled plans to go to Paris in December to study for at least two months. She said she now felt intimidated by college classmates who had studied abroad and spoke better French.\n\u201cI feel at a disadvantage,\u201d she said. \u201cThe global economy has not been good to me.\u201d\nThose still going abroad face other problems. Lee Min-hye, a 22-year-old bioengineering major at Yonsei University in Seoul, had planned to study English in Boston and dreamed of strolling through Boston Common, which she saw once in a movie. But then the won\u2019s decline pushed the price of tuition above her father\u2019s annual salary as a semiconductor engineer.\nAfter much agonizing, she decided to attend a school in Sydney that costs about 40 percent less.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give up if you want a good job in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to go abroad somewhere to keep up with all the other Koreans who study abroad.\u201d\nOther South Koreans are choosing still cheaper countries for English-language study, such as South Africa and Malaysia. One of the most popular low-cost destinations is the Philippines, where students can live in resort-like accommodations and receive one-on-one lessons for about $750 a month.\nSome education experts worry that if the financial crisis drags on, it could worsen social inequalities by making study abroad at top schools a privilege affordable only for the wealthy.\n\u201cUpper-middle-class families will still have the ability to send their children abroad, even if it means great sacrifice,\u201d said Oh Ookwhan, a professor of education at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. \u201cThis will allow them to stay ahead of less fortunate families.\u201d\nFear of falling behind makes most South Koreans reluctant to abandon their plans, even if they have to postpone them. Ms. Seo, who canceled her studies in Sydney, said she remained determined to go, despite pressure from family and friends to settle down in Seoul and get married. She has tried to save more money and keep up her English skills while waiting for the crisis to pass.\n\u201cI feel insecure, just waiting like this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t give up my education.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/world/asia/10students.html", "title": "Global Financial Crisis Upends the Plans of Many South Koreans to Study Abroad", "author": "MARTIN FACKLER"}
{"date": "Mon, 31 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 The oil giant Chevron said Monday that it had obtained video recordings of meetings in Ecuador this year that appear to reveal a bribery scheme connected to a $27 billion lawsuit the company faces over environmental damage at oil fields it operated in remote areas of the Amazon forest in Ecuador.\nThe videos, together with audio recordings obtained by businessmen using watches and pens implanted with bugging devices, appear to implicate Ecuadoran officials and political operatives, including possibly Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez, the judge overseeing the lawsuit, and Pierina Correa, the sister of Ecuador\u2019s president, Rafael Correa.\nThe recordings indicate that an Ecuadoran political operative was working to obtain $3 million in bribes related to environmental cleanup contracts to be awarded in the event of a ruling against Chevron.\nIt was not clear from the recordings and transcripts provided by Chevron, however, whether any bribes discussed in the recordings were actually paid or whether Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez was even aware of plans to try to bribe him. The tapes also did not demonstrate whether the president\u2019s sister was aware of the scheme or had participated in it.\nBut in a statement that Chevron says illustrates that the judge\u2019s handling of the case is flawed, Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez said on one of the video recordings that he planned to rule against Chevron by January and that damages could exceed $27 billion.\nJudge N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who presides over the case from a cramped office in the town of Lago Agrio in Ecuador, could not be reached for comment on Monday.\nThe recordings, which Chevron placed on its Web site, are the latest twist in a 16-year legal battle over oil contamination of jungle areas in northern Ecuador. Mr. Correa, a left-wing economist who rose from obscurity to become Ecuador\u2019s strongest president in recent memory, has repeatedly sided with the plaintiffs in the case, prompting a fierce lobbying effort by Chevron in Washington to strip Ecuador of American trade preferences.\nThat effort failed in June when the Obama administration, seizing a chance to improve ties with Mr. Correa, allowed the preferences to continue. But the release of the recordings will focus more scrutiny on Mr. Correa, who has come under pressure over his clashes with the media and accusations of corruption involving another family member, his brother Fabricio Correa, a prominent businessman.\nAlexis Mera, a legal adviser to the president, dismissed the recordings as \u201capproaching the level of defamatory libel.\u201d He said Chevron was benefiting from the crime of intercepting conversations without authorization, reflecting \u201ca terrible legal strategy.\u201d\nSteven Donziger, a lawyer representing the group of Ecuadorans who are suing Chevron, contending that they had been harmed by the oil contamination, said: \u201cI suspect this is a Chevron sting operation; there needs to be an investigation into Chevron\u2019s role in this as much as the judge\u2019s. I find it awfully odd that these individuals would secretly film meetings using James Bond devices like a spy watch and a spy pen.\n\u201cAt the end of the day this will not affect the underlying case,\u201d Mr. Donziger said, \u201cother than it might cause a short delay if the judge needs to be replaced.\u201d\nChevron said it had obtained the recordings from Diego Borja, an Ecuadoran who once worked as a logistics contractor for the company. The company said Mr. Borja had been working with an American businessman, Wayne Hansen, to secure water treatment contracts. Chevron said that neither man had been paid for the recordings, but that the company paid for Mr. Borja and his family to leave Ecuador because of concern about his safety.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think he brought them to us out of respect for our company and concern for what seemed to be transpiring here,\u201d Charles James, an executive vice president of Chevron, said of the recordings in a telephone interview. \u201cWe think this information absolutely disqualifies the judge and nullifies anything that he has ever done in this case.\u201d\nIn one of the recordings made in June, the political operative, Patricio Garc\u00eda, who identified himself as an official in Mr. Correa\u2019s political party, referred to $3 million in bribes to be split equally among the judge, the presidency and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Mr. Correa\u2019s party, Mr. Garc\u00eda said, would receive the $1 million payment on behalf of the plaintiffs.\nIn the same meeting, Mr. Garc\u00eda told Mr. Borja how to approach Ms. Correa, the president\u2019s sister, about the bribe. \u201cTell Pierina clearly, \u2018Madam Pierina, what we came to do beyond anything else is to participate, participate in the remediation. That\u2019s why I want to make you part of this,\u2019 \u201c he said.\nThe recordings do not indicate whether Ms. Correa was aware of the efforts to include her in a bribery scheme. Nor is there confirmation that Mr. Garc\u00eda was in fact in contact with her.\nSecret recordings of closed-door meetings have become a common feature of Ecuadoran politics. Mr. Correa, furious over the recent airing of a recording of a private conversation in his office with a cabinet minister and a member of congress, said he would request the shutdown of the television network that broadcast the recording.\n\u201cThis is an attack on national security,\u201d he said.\nBut while Mr. Correa takes such recordings seriously, it is not clear if the people whose conversations about contract bribes were recorded by Mr. Borja grasped the complexity of the Chevron lawsuit. For instance, appeals by Chevron could delay for years the payment of damages that could be used for water cleanup contracts.\nStill, the recordings offered a glimpse into the murky world of Ecuadoran politics and business. In another reference to Ms. Correa\u2019s ability to ensure that the contracts would be forthcoming, Mr. Garc\u00eda said, \u201cPierina knows absolutely everything.\u201d\nHe told Mr. Borja of a conversation he said he had with Ms. Correa, according to a transcript. \u201cSo she says: \u2018Patricio, I just have to tell Rafael this one little thing, nothing else. Nothing else,\u2019 \u201c he said.\nChevron said the assertion should be investigated.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/world/americas/01ecuador.html", "title": "Chevron Offers Evidence of Bribery Scheme in Ecuador Lawsuit", "author": "SIMON ROMERO and CLIFFORD KRAUSS"}

Mexico has 121; the United States, with a much larger population, has 211.\nThe last W.H.O. update, issued July 6, showed 94,512 confirmed cases in 122 countries, with 429 deaths.\nMany epidemiologists have pointed out that, in reality, millions of people have had swine flu, usually in mild form, so the numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases were actually meaningless. And performing the tests has overwhelmed many national laboratories.\nBut the cases \u2014 and, more to the point, the deaths \u2014 have been closely watched by the media and flu experts, even those who knew they were undercounts, as a crude measure of how the epidemic spread around the globe. Such figures can also, in theory, be useful to public health officials. For example, knowing that Chile has had far fewer deaths than Argentina even though their outbreaks began almost simultaneously could be useful to other countries who might want to imitate Chile\u2019s response.\nThe briefing note said countries would still be asked to report their first few confirmed cases. It also said countries should watch for clusters of fatalities, which could indicate the virus had mutated to a more lethal form. Other \u201csignals to be vigilant for,\u201d it said, were spikes in school absenteeism and surges in hospital visits.\nWealthy countries routinely collect such data, and also do blood tests to see what percentage of a population has flu antibodies, indicating they were infected but recovered. However, poor countries do not.\nDr. Joseph S. Bresee, chief of epidemiology for the C.D.C.\u2019s flu division, said he agreed with the W.H.O. premise that case counts were just too inaccurate to keep using.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what their plans are,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped they would track the severity and spread of flu cases over time, as his agency does state-by-state in flu season. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like they\u2019re just going to let the screen go blank.\u201d\nDr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said confused journalists in many countries had misread the low W.H.O. numbers of confirmed deaths to report that the new flu is not a threat. And testing is so hit-or-miss that even apparent differences in death rates like those between Chile and Argentina \u201cmay not be based in science,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBad measures can be worse than no measures at all,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I hope this will force the public health community to come up with better ones.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/world/17flu.html", "title": "W.H.O.

The turnabout came after The New York Times reported last Saturday on the decision to halt the shipment and recall an advance team that had been sent to Afghanistan, and after Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates asked the Army to explain the delay.\n\u201cSecretary Gates takes a special interest in all force protection matters,\u201d said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary. \u201cHe wanted to know why this latest body armor design had not yet been provided to our soldiers in the field. He asked his staff to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\nArmy officials had said that further reviews of the new equipment, and of body armor in particular, were to make certain that the entire set of protective vests, clothing, weapons and tools would be an \u201cintegrated system\u201d with a goal that soldiers would not be put at additional risk during the assessment, to be carried out during combat operations.\nOn Friday, Army officials said that the pre-deployment tests of the equipment had been completed, and that the service\u2019s leadership was satisfied that the new gear would adequately protect soldiers while helping to relieve exhaustion and reduce injuries \u2014 and give troops greater mobility, which adds to their survivability.\nAmong the equipment being sent to Afghanistan, about five pounds will be cut with the use of a lighter, more comfortable vest and carrier system for bullet-proof plates that cover the chest and back, Army officials said. However, the Army decided not to send a lighter model of bullet-proof plates as originally proposed, but instead will continue using the current Army-approved plates that are about four pounds heavier.\nThe lighter plates have been adopted by the military\u2019s Special Operations Command, which includes the Army\u2019s elite light infantry troops, the Rangers. But senior Army officials said the extra protection offered by the heavier plates was important to protect soldiers on patrol in Afghanistan, given the increase in insurgent violence.\nArmy officials said that a persistent problem, and one that had delayed this assessment, was a lack of standard testing procedures across the armed forces.\nTogether, the new body armor, boots, rucksacks, weapons and slings for carrying extra bullets will shave at least 13 pounds from the load of the average soldier and almost 25 pounds for those who carry heavy machine guns. Models of the new machine gun are already in Afghanistan, officials said.\nThe average soldier\u2019s load is about 60 pounds on routine patrols, but it doubles when soldiers must be away from base for days in the unforgiving mountains, valleys and deserts of Afghanistan.\nAn Army spokesman said Friday that the lighter-weight equipment would be provided next month to about 480 soldiers assigned to two battalions of the Fourth Infantry Division, now training at Fort Carson, Colo., before their deployment in coming weeks to Afghanistan.\nOnce they arrive in Afghanistan, the troops will be given several weeks to acclimate to the terrain before an assessment team, headed by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in conjunction with the Army\u2019s Asymmetric Warfare Group, arrives.Army officials stressed that soldiers will have available both the lighter plate carrier and vest and the heavier body armor for when that is required on missions.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/world/25army.html", "title": "Army Ends Delay on Lightweight Armor", "author": "THOM SHANKER"}

{"date": "Wed, 22 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PHUKET, Thailand \u2014 Stiffening the American line against Iran, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned Wednesday that the United States would consider extending a \u201cdefense umbrella\u201d over the Middle East if the country continued to defy international demands that it halt work that could lead to nuclear weapons.\nWhile such a defensive shield has long been assumed, administration officials in Washington acknowledged Wednesday that no senior official had ever publicly discussed it. Some of the officials said the timing of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks reflected a growing sense that President Obama needed to signal to Tehran that its nuclear ambitions could be countered militarily, as well as diplomatically.\nIt also signified increasing concern in Washington that other Middle East states \u2014 notably Saudi Arabia and Egypt \u2014 might be tempted to pursue their own nuclear programs for fear Iran was growing closer to realizing its presumed nuclear ambitions.\nMrs. Clinton later clarified her comments on Iran, delivered in advance of a regional meeting here, saying her warning that the United States might create such an umbrella did not represent any backing away from the Obama administration\u2019s position that it must prevent Tehran from obtaining a bomb capability. But her words suggested that the administration was developing a strategy should all efforts at negotiation fail.\nHer statement also came as Iran\u2019s internal divisions and crackdown on post-election protests have complicated Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge to \u201cengage\u201d Iran directly. Iranian officials have hinted that they will present new proposals on the nuclear program, and American officials have said their offers to negotiate stand.\nSpeaking during a televised town hall meeting in Bangkok, Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cWe want Iran to calculate what I think is a fair assessment, that if the U.S. extends a defense umbrella over the region, if we do even more to support the military capacity of those in the gulf, it\u2019s unlikely that Iran will be any stronger or safer, because they won\u2019t be able to intimidate and dominate, as they apparently believe they can, once they have a nuclear weapon.\u201d\nAsked about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, the British ambassador to the United States, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be read as an acceptance of an Iranian nuclear weapon\u201d but rather as a statement intended to \u201creassure our partners in the gulf.\u201d\nA senior White House official said he believed that Mrs. Clinton was speaking for herself and that she was, as she insisted, restating existing policy.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s invocation of a defense umbrella is reminiscent of the so-called nuclear umbrella that Washington extends to its Asian allies: implicitly, the promise of an American reprisal if they are attacked by nuclear weapons. But she did not use the term nuclear, and a senior State Department official cautioned that her remarks should not be interpreted to mean that.\nAfter meeting the foreign ministers of China, Russia, Japan and South Korea, Mrs. Clinton also said that the United States would not offer new incentives to North Korea to return to negotiations. She said all of the other nations that had engaged in talks with North Korea in the past five years were united in demanding that North Korea undertake a \u201ccomplete and irreversible denuclearization\u201d before receiving any economic or political incentives from them.\nShe did not detail the steps that would be part of such a process, though she confirmed that they could include the disabling of the Yongbyon nuclear complex. Last year, North Korea began to dismantle that complex, where it runs a nuclear reactor and reprocess fuel rods to recover plutonium, but it vowed in June to restart production there.\nThe United States has had an uncharacteristically visible presence at this gathering of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean. It signed a friendship treaty with Asean\u2019s 10 members and called on one country, Myanmar, to release the imprisoned pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\nIsrael\u2019s minister of intelligence and atomic energy, Dan Meridor, told Israeli Army radio: \u201cI was not thrilled to hear the American statement from yesterday that they will protect their allies with a nuclear umbrella, as if they have already come to terms with a nuclear Iran. I think that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton said she was trying to make even starker the choice Iran faced if it did not agree to abandon its program.\nThe administration has talked about bolstering the military capacity of Iran\u2019s neighbors in the Persian Gulf so they could better meet the threat of a heavily armed Iran. It has also defended the proposed missile defense system in Eastern Europe as a potential shield against Iran.\n\u201cIt faces the prospect, if it pursues nuclear weapons, of sparking an arms race in the region,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cThat should affect the calculation of what Iran intends to do, and what it believes is in its national security interest.\u201d\nOn North Korea, Mrs. Clinton tried to project a united front, saying that China, Russia, Japan and South Korea had pledged to carry out the United Nations sanctions adopted in June against the North after its recent nuclear and missile tests.\nMrs. Clinton also reiterated concerns that North Korea might be transferring nuclear technology to Myanmar, which American officials refer to by its former name, Burma. She is to deliver a statement on North Korea on Thursday. In an excerpt provided to reporters, the tone remained unyielding, but the United States pledged to give North Korea \u201csignificant economic and energy assistance\u201d if it undertook a verifiable denuclearization.\nAt the ministers meeting, Mrs. Clinton demanded that Myanmar release Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who could face years in prison on charges that she violated her house arrest. \u201cIt\u2019s so critical that she be released from this persecution that she has been under,\u201d she said later at a news conference. \u201cIf she were released, that would open up opportunities, at least for my country, to expand our relationship with Burma, including investments in Burma.\u201d\nAmerican officials met with diplomatic officials from Myanmar later to reiterate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s demand.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/world/asia/23diplo.html", "title": "Clinton Speaks of Shielding Mideast From Iran", "author": "MARK LANDLER and DAVID E.

{"date": "Mon, 20 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Four American soldiers were killed by a roadside explosion in eastern Afghanistan on Monday, making July the deadliest month for American service members in the country since the 2001 invasion and underscoring the frightening rise in the sophistication and accuracy of roadside bombs.\nWith the four newest fatalities, at least 30 Americans have died in the first three weeks of July, surpassing the highest previous monthly toll, 28, reached in June 2008.\nPart of the reason for July\u2019s sharply higher fatalities \u2014 for American troops and for British and other NATO forces \u2014 is the three-week-old offensive in opium-rich Helmand Province, where United States Marines and British soldiers are trying to take control of areas dominated by the Taliban.\nBut the most significant factor is the increasing power of roadside bombs employed by guerrillas in eastern and southern Afghanistan, including Helmand.\nThe bombs are generally not as powerful as the improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.\u2019s, used by Iraqi guerrillas, who drew on huge stockpiles of artillery shells the Pentagon left unguarded. In later years, Shiite insurgents also employed explosively formed penetrators, a more precisely machined bomb that launched a fist-size molten ball that could pierce the thickest armor.\nBy contrast, Afghan guerrillas have fewer tools at their disposal \u2014 yet the toll of I.E.D. deaths continues to rise just as it did as the Iraqi insurgency grew stronger in 2005.\nTwenty-one American soldiers have died from I.E.D. blasts so far this month, according to data recorded by icasualties.org, which tracks military deaths. Six more Americans were killed by fire from Kalashnikovs or other guns, rockets, mortar shells and rocket-propelled grenades. Two Air Force officers were killed when their F-15E fighter jet crashed on Saturday, and a sailor died from pneumonia earlier this month, according to the group\u2019s Web site.\nThe military tallies do not include Afghan civilians regularly killed by I.E.D.\u2019s often intended for Western or Afghan forces. On Sunday at least 10 Afghan civilians died in Farah Province along the Iranian border when a minibus and truck were struck by two hidden bombs, authorities said. \u201cThe Taliban are planting mines on roads in which both officials and civilians are traveling, but often civilians are the victims,\u201d said Lt. Col. Juma Khan, an Afghan commander in Farah.\nTaliban fighters do have access to mortar shells and military munitions, but many bombs are made from rudimentary ingredients like fertilizer and diesel fuel. Such bombs are less effective, but with enough fertilizer and diesel, Afghan guerrillas have shown they can destroy almost anything American forces operate in the rugged countryside.\nAnd the Taliban exploit environmental factors: Afghanistan has few paved roads, making it easier for insurgents to bury bombs with no trace. Moreover, the new mine-resistant vehicles effective at protecting troops from I.E.D.\u2019s in Iraq have struggled on Afghanistan\u2019s uneven and craggy landscape. The Pentagon is developing a lighter and less cumbersome version.\nEven before Monday\u2019s American fatalities crossed a new threshold, July had already become the deadliest month for the entire NATO-led coalition: At least 56 coalition troops have died this month, surpassing the previous high of 46 recorded in June and August 2008, according to icasualties.org. Two out of every three coalition deaths in July have been from I.E.D.\u2019s.\nThe British military has lost 17 soldiers this month, all but one in Helmand Province. Lt. Col. Rupert Thorneloe, the 39-year-old commander of the First Battalion of the Welsh Guards, was killed by an I.E.D. on July 1, the most senior British commander to die in battle since the Falklands war.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/world/asia/21afghan.html", "title": "A Deadly Month for U.S. Troops in Afghanistan", "author": "RICHARD A.

This year it is devoted to \u201cThe Church in Africa at the Service of Reconciliation, Justice and Peace.\u201d\nOn the first stop in his six-day trip, in French- and English-speaking Cameroon, Benedict is expected to present the working paper for the synod, which was called by Pope John Paul II before he died in 2005.\nThe synod is expected to touch on the church\u2019s role in promoting democracy and social justice; \u201cinculturation,\u201d or finding a balance between Rome-mandated Catholic dogma and the varieties of local practice; health; and the tensions in Africa between Catholics, Muslims and the continent\u2019s fast-growing Pentecostal population.\nThere is a lot at stake. By 2025, one-sixth of the world\u2019s Catholics, or about 230 million, are expected to be African. The world\u2019s largest seminary is in Nigeria, which borders on Cameroon in western Africa, and over all, Africa produces a large percentage of the world\u2019s priests.\nAfrica is the continent \u201cwhere the church appears most vital, appears in a phase of expansion,\u201d said Sandro Magister, a veteran Italian Vatican journalist. \u201cBut this expansion is also very fragile.\u201d He added that it \u201cshows the typical characteristics of youth and adolescence: great waves of feeling and emotion with rather weak roots.\u201d\nAlthough the Vatican hierarchy is a deeply European institution, it too has changed over the years. Pope John XXIII appointed the first African cardinal in 1960. There are now 16 cardinals from Africa, out of 192.\n\u201cYou sometimes hear the remark that the main problem with the Vatican is it\u2019s 2,000 miles too far north,\u201d said Philip Jenkins, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and the author of \u201cThe Lost History of Christianity,\u201d about the early history of Christianity in Africa and Asia.\nIn his more than 25 years as pope, John Paul II made 16 trips to Africa, visiting 42 countries. In many ways, Africa would seem a lower priority for Benedict, who in his four years as pope has been deeply preoccupied with strengthening the church in Europe, where its status is increasingly diminished.\nBut Africa is important for Benedict\u2019s vision. Compared with Europe and the United States, African churches tend to take a more traditional line on issues like homosexuality.\n\u201cNot just is Christianity booming in that part of the world, it seems to be a pretty conservative kind of Catholicism,\u201d said Professor Jenkins, of Penn State. \u201cI think he has high hopes of the global south churches,\u201d and sees them \u201cas a very serious counterbalance to liberal trends in the north.\u201d\nBut the situation on the ground is rich and complex.\nMany local African prelates must set their own guidelines for how to balance Catholicism with the faith healing and animal sacrifice practiced by many parishioners.\nThe Catholic Church is also concerned that tribalism could undermine its more universal authority, especially if clerics are seen as too closely tied to a particular ethnic or tribal group.\nSimilarly, preaching the gospel in the local language could tie it to one ethnic group, yet reading it only in a formerly colonial language poses other complications.\nBenedict has tried to crack down on the tendency of many African priests to take wives. Addressing a meeting of African bishops in Rome in 2005, Benedict implored them \u201cto select conscientiously candidates for the priesthood,\u201d and to encourage them \u201cto open themselves fully to serving others as Christ did by embracing the gift of celibacy.\u201d\nIn the same address, Benedict spoke on AIDS for the first time as pope, calling it \u201ca cruel epidemic\u201d that \u201cnot only kills but seriously threatens the economic and social stability of the continent.\u201d\nHe also stated the Vatican\u2019s position forbidding the use of condoms. \u201cThe traditional teaching of the church has proven to be the only fail-safe way to prevent the spread of H.I.V./AIDS,\u201d Benedict said then, adding his endorsement of \u201cChristian marriage and fidelity\u201d and \u201cchastity.\u201d\nOn his Africa trip, the pope is not expected to revisit the Vatican\u2019s stance on condoms, according to the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi. \u201cThe position we have is that to think you can resolve AIDS with condoms is an illusion,\u201d Father Lombardi said. Instead, he added, the church will continue to endorse education, promoting \u201cmore responsible sexuality,\u201d within the confines of marriage.\nIn many places in Africa, including Nigeria, Catholicism and Islam are fighting for souls. In Cameroon, which has a significant Muslim population, the pope is expected to meet with Muslim clerics.\nIn Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, the church is increasingly worried about losing ground to charismatic Pentecostal churches. In recent years, those churches have radically transformed the religious landscape in Latin America, which has the world\u2019s largest Catholic population.\nIn Angola, which emerged in 2002 from 25 years of civil war, Benedict is expected to meet with politicians and diplomats to speak out against corruption and assert the renewed role that the church hopes to play in fostering democracy and civil society in Africa.\nHe will also mark 500 years since Catholic missionaries began converting people in the former Portuguese colony and meet with groups promoting the role of women in Africa.\nIn his weekly angelus message on Sunday, Benedict said that on his trip to Africa he intended \u201cto embrace the entire African continent, its thousand differences and its deep religious spirit, its ancient cultures and its difficult path toward development and reconciliation, its painful wounds and its enormous potential and hope.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/world/africa/16pope.html", "title": "On Africa Trip, Pope Will Find Place Where Church Is Surging Amid Travail", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}
{"date": "Wed, 11 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Sofia, a 34-year-old Frenchwoman, moved here a year ago to take a job in advertising, so confident about Dubai\u2019s fast-growing economy that she bought an apartment for almost $300,000 with a 15-year mortgage.\nNow, like many of the foreign workers who make up 90 percent of the population here, she has been laid off and faces the prospect of being forced to leave this Persian Gulf city \u2014 or worse.\n\u201cI\u2019m really scared of what could happen, because I bought property here,\u201d said Sofia, who asked that her last name be withheld because she is still hunting for a new job. \u201cIf I can\u2019t pay it off, I was told I could end up in debtors\u2019 prison.\u201d\nWith Dubai\u2019s economy in free fall, newspapers have reported that more than 3,000 cars sit abandoned in the parking lot at the Dubai Airport, left by fleeing, debt-ridden foreigners (who could in fact be imprisoned if they failed to pay their bills). Some are said to have maxed-out credit cards inside and notes of apology taped to the windshield.\nThe government says the real number is much lower. But the stories contain at least a grain of truth: jobless people here lose their work visas and then must leave the country within a month. That in turn reduces spending, creates housing vacancies and lowers real estate prices, in a downward spiral that has left parts of Dubai \u2014 once hailed as the economic superpower of the Middle East \u2014 looking like a ghost town.\nNo one knows how bad things have become, though it is clear that tens of thousands have left, real estate prices have crashed and scores of Dubai\u2019s major construction projects have been suspended or canceled. But with the government unwilling to provide data, rumors are bound to flourish, damaging confidence and further undermining the economy.\nInstead of moving toward greater transparency, the emirates seem to be moving in the other direction. A new draft media law would make it a crime to damage the country\u2019s reputation or economy, punishable by fines of up to 1 million dirhams (about $272,000). Some say it is already having a chilling effect on reporting about the crisis.\nLast month, local newspapers reported that Dubai was canceling 1,500 work visas every day, citing unnamed government officials. Asked about the number, Humaid bin Dimas, a spokesman for Dubai\u2019s Labor Ministry, said he would not confirm or deny it and refused to comment further. Some say the true figure is much higher.\n\u201cAt the moment there is a readiness to believe the worst,\u201d said Simon Williams, HSBC bank\u2019s chief economist in Dubai. \u201cAnd the limits on data make it difficult to counter the rumors.\u201d\nSome things are clear: real estate prices, which rose dramatically during Dubai\u2019s six-year boom, have dropped 30 percent or more over the past two or three months in some parts of the city. Last week, Moody\u2019s Investor\u2019s Service announced that it might downgrade its ratings on six of Dubai\u2019s most prominent state-owned companies, citing a deterioration in the economic outlook. So many used luxury cars are for sale , they are sometimes sold for 40 percent less than the asking price two months ago, car dealers say. Dubai\u2019s roads, usually thick with traffic at this time of year, are now mostly clear.\nSome analysts say the crisis is likely to have long-lasting effects on the seven-member emirates federation, where Dubai has long played rebellious younger brother to oil-rich and more conservative Abu Dhabi. Dubai officials, swallowing their pride, have made clear that they would be open to a bailout, but so far Abu Dhabi has offered assistance only to its own banks.\n\u201cWhy is Abu Dhabi allowing its neighbor to have its international reputation trashed, when it could bail out Dubai\u2019s banks and restore confidence?\u201d said Christopher M. Davidson, who predicted the current crisis in \u201cDubai: The Vulnerability of Success,\u201d a book published last year. \u201cPerhaps the plan is to centralize the U.A.E.\u201d under Abu Dhabi\u2019s control, he mused, in a move that would sharply curtail Dubai\u2019s independence and perhaps change its signature freewheeling style.\nFor many foreigners, Dubai had seemed at first to be a refuge, relatively insulated from the panic that began hitting the rest of the world last autumn. The Persian Gulf is cushioned by vast oil and gas wealth, and some who lost jobs in New York and London began applying here.\nBut Dubai, unlike Abu Dhabi or nearby Qatar and Saudi Arabia, does not have its own oil, and had built its reputation on real estate, finance and tourism. Now, many expatriates here talk about Dubai as though it were a con game all along. Lurid rumors spread quickly: the Palm Jumeira, an artificial island that is one of this city\u2019s trademark developments, is said to be sinking, and when you turn the faucets in the hotels built atop it, only cockroaches come out.\n\u201cIs it going to get better? They tell you that, but I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore,\u201d said Sofia, who still hopes to find a job before her time runs out. \u201cPeople are really panicking quickly.\u201d\nHamza Thiab, a 27-year-old Iraqi who moved here from Baghdad in 2005, lost his job with an engineering firm six weeks ago. He has until the end of February to find a job, or he must leave. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for a new job for three months, and I\u2019ve only had two interviews,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, you used to open up the papers here and see dozens of jobs. The minimum for a civil engineer with four years\u2019 experience used to be 15,000 dirhams a month. Now, the maximum you\u2019ll get is 8,000,\u201d or about $2,000.\nMr. Thiab was sitting in a Costa Coffee Shop in the Ibn Battuta mall, where most of the customers seemed to be single men sitting alone, dolefully drinking coffee at midday. If he fails to find a job, he will have to go to Jordan, where he has family members \u2014 Iraq is still too dangerous, he says \u2014 though the situation is no better there. Before that, he will have to borrow money from his father to pay off the more than $12,000 he still owes on a bank loan for his Honda Civic. Iraqi friends bought fancier cars and are now, with no job, struggling to sell them.\n\u201cBefore, so many of us were living a good life here,\u201d Mr. Thiab said. \u201cNow we cannot pay our loans. We are all just sleeping, smoking, drinking coffee and having headaches because of the situation.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/middleeast/12dubai.html", "title": "Laid-Off Foreigners Flee as Dubai Spirals Down", "author": "ROBERT F.

{"date": "Mon, 06 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JOHANNESBURG \u2014 Corruption charges against Jacob Zuma \u2014 the man almost certain to become South Africa\u2019s president after elections later this month \u2014 were dropped Monday by prosecutors who said the case had been tainted by a tawdry, secret manipulation of the legal process from within their own ranks.\nThe case has deeply divided the country and struck at one of its core political questions: how to uphold the rule of law, a particular point of pride in this nascent democracy, when the nation is dominated by a single party and the party\u2019s most influential figures vie for power.\nSouth Africa has the continent\u2019s largest economy, and while the decision to halt the prosecution may spare the country the discomfort of being led by a defendant in a corruption case, it did not resolve the underlying allegations that Mr. Zuma, the leader of the governing African National Congress, thrived off 783 payments over a decade\u2019s time from a convicted briber.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad to see Africa\u2019s major country now going down the same route by which corruption is easily excused by political authorities in other African countries,\u201d said Laurence Cockcroft, a board member of the British chapter of Transparency International, an anticorruption group.\nIn recent years, the Zuma case has dominated this nation\u2019s political discourse, leading to a split within the A.N.C. and providing a rallying cry for Mr. Zuma\u2019s supporters to oust President Thabo Mbeki in September.\nFor the past two weeks, news organizations reported that after years of pursuing Mr. Zuma, the National Prosecuting Authority was suddenly considering a withdrawal of the charges. Mokotedi Mpshe, the acting head of the agency, who had previously pursued the case, began the much anticipated news conference on Monday by lamenting that he had \u201cpainful facts\u201d to present and that he hoped the nation would \u201cfind ways to learn from this bitter experience.\u201d\nHe said the Zuma case had been irredeemably spoiled by \u201ccollusion\u201d between two of his erstwhile colleagues: Bulelani Ngcuka, a former head of the prosecuting agency, and Leonard McCarthy, the onetime chief of an elite unit of investigators known as the Scorpions. Proof of their misconduct, Mr. Mpshe said, had been submitted to prosecutors by Mr. Zuma\u2019s legal team, which had come into possession of wiretaps by the National Intelligence Agency.\nTranscripts of some of those recorded conversations were made public on Monday, and they seemed to show the former colleagues discussing ways to time the charges against Mr. Zuma, who was then locked in a battle for leadership of the A.N.C. with Mr. Mbeki, his archrival.\nIn December 2007, Mr. Zuma won the A.N.C. vote. Shortly after, Mr. McCarthy said, \u201cI am Thabo man\u201d and appeared to allude to a visit with Mr. Mbeki.\n\u201cSaw the man on Friday evening, we planning a comeback strategy and once we have achieved that, we will clean up all around us, my friend,\u201d he said, according to the transcript.\nWithin a few days, the prosecuting authority had filed a new indictment against Mr. Zuma.\nThese and other conversations, Mr. Mpshe said, led him to conclude that \u201can intolerable abuse has occurred which compels a discontinuation of the prosecution.\u201d The \u201cprosecution team itself\u201d disagreed, preferring that the decision be left to a court, he added. But he said he believed that the prosecuting authority must be \u201cbeyond reproach.\u201d\nWillie Hofmeyr, his deputy director, said the decision proved South Africa\u2019s commitment to due process. He likened the situation to a criminal suspect\u2019s being freed because of an improper search warrant. \u201cWe do need to have clean hands,\u201d he said.\nContacted late Monday, Mr. Mbeki\u2019s spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga, said he had no comment on the transcripts. \u201cI think you must pose those questions to Mr. McCarthy, not me,\u201d he said.\nMr. McCarthy joined the World Bank in June to head its Department of Institutional Integrity. He was not immediately available for comment. Mr. Ngcuka told the South African Press Association he \u201cwanted to study the statement\u201d made at the news conference before responding.\nFor Zuma supporters, the decision on Monday was seen as a vindication of their leader, who has argued from the start that the charges were politically motivated. Gwede Mantashe, the A.N.C.\u2019s secretary general, called it \u201ca victory for the rule of law, democracy and common sense.\u201d\nMr. Zuma, 66, is widely viewed as a populist, a man of the people with a propensity to break out in dance after delivering a speech. After the announcement, there were celebrations across the country with thousands dancing in jubilation and singing Mr. Zuma\u2019s trademark anthem, \u201cBring Me My Machine Gun.\u201d\nBut South Africa is badly torn over the Zuma case, and the dividing line is not as simple as a belief in guilt or innocence. Some Zuma supporters are willing to accept his culpability but protest his being singled out among a larger group of presumed profiteers in government. One poll of A.N.C. voters taken last October showed that only 41 percent thought him to be innocent.\nAmong Mr. Zuma\u2019s detractors, the decision on Monday was seen as an outrage that, while not unexpected, was nevertheless another sign that the nation\u2019s justice system was malleable to manipulation by the powerful.\nHelen Zille, leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, said that with elections coming on April 22, the prosecuting authority had finally \u201cbuckled to political pressure.\u201d\nPatricia De Lille, leader of the Independent Democrats, said that opposition groups were considering joining in some kind of legal challenge that might resurrect the charges. \u201cThe first casualty is the principle of all are equal before the law,\u201d she said.\nMr. Zuma had been charged with 12 counts of fraud, two more of corruption and one each of money laundering and racketeering. The case was built around payments made to him by his close friend and financial adviser Schabir Shaik, who was convicted in 2005 of bribing Mr. Zuma in return for smoothing his way into various deals. According to prosecutors, Mr. Zuma used Mr. Shaik the way others might employ an A.T.M., extracting cash for items like family vacations, medical bills and even traffic fines.\nIf Mr. Shaik was guilty, many here wondered, how could the verdict be otherwise for Mr. Zuma? Indeed, the trial judge in the Shaik case found there to be a \u201cmutually beneficial symbiosis\u201d between the men, and an appellate court said \u201cthe only reasonable inference\u201d about Mr. Shaik\u2019s payments to his friend was they were \u201cto influence Mr. Zuma to act in conflict with his constitutional duties.\u201d\nLast May, a ruling of South Africa\u2019s highest court said that Mr. Shaik had \u201cbribed\u201d Mr. Zuma and that Mr. Zuma \u201cdid as a matter of fact promote Mr. Shaik\u2019s interests.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/world/africa/07safrica.html", "title": "South Africa Drops Charges Against Leading Presidential Contender", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}

And it will apply to new residential building, so existing construction \u2014 nearly 3,000 housing units \u2014 will continue, and public structures like schools and community centers will be unaffected.\nAt a news conference in Jerusalem shortly after the security cabinet\u2019s vote, Mr. Netanyahu said that Israel was taking a \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201cpainful\u201d step, and that he hoped the Palestinians and the Arab world would \u201cseize this opportunity\u201d to work toward peace.\nHe added that there would be \u201cno restrictions on building in our sovereign capital,\u201d and emphasized that at the end of the 10-month period, the government would \u201crevert to the policies of previous governments in relation to construction\u201d in the settlements.\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the pause in construction \u201chelps move forward\u201d the peace process. Through negotiations, she said, the two sides could reconcile Israel\u2019s desire for recognized and secure borders with Palestinian hopes for an independent state based on borders before the 1967 war.\nIn the finely nuanced world of Middle East diplomacy, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s reference to \u201c1967 lines\u201d is noteworthy, according to American and Israeli officials and outside experts. Israel does not wish to enter into negotiations with any reference to borders, these people said, because doing so would reduce its room to maneuver. By explicitly mentioning borders, the Obama administration is pushing both sides, particularly Israel, to start to confront so-called final status issues.\n\u201cWe would prefer language that does not predetermine the outcome before negotiations start,\u201d said Michael B. Oren, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States. \u201cOne of our objections is that we do not believe that \u201967 borders are defensible.\u201d\nThe timing of the administration\u2019s statement chagrined Israeli officials, since Mr. Oren said Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s decision to temporarily halt settlement construction was \u201ca gesture, first of all, to the president of the United States. I can\u2019t stress that enough.\u201d\nThe building moratorium was previously offered to the Palestinians via Mrs. Clinton. It was turned down on the grounds that it did not include Jerusalem. At a briefing on Wednesday for foreign reporters in his office in Ramallah, in the West Bank, the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, said the announcement would not bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for the resumption of the process for the sake of it,\u201d Mr. Fayyad said. \u201cThis is not new. The exclusion of Jerusalem is a very serious problem for us.\u201d\nThe Obama administration seemed determined to put a good face on a proposal that fell well short of what it wanted. The administration\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East, George J. Mitchell, said in a briefing that \u201cthe steps announced by the prime minister are significant and could have substantial impact on the ground.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cFor the first time ever, an Israeli government will stop housing approvals and all new construction of housing units and related infrastructure in West Bank settlements. That\u2019s a positive development.\u201d\nStill, American officials struggled to stop short of characterizing the move as \u201cunprecedented\u201d \u2014 a term used by Mrs. Clinton several weeks ago in Jerusalem, which prompted outrage on the part of Arab and Palestinian officials.\nIn its struggle to keep the peace process alive, Mr. Mitchell said the administration was seeking negotiations on several levels: between higher-level officials, between lower-level officials, and in parallel talks between Israel and the United States and between the Palestinians and the United States.\n\u201cThe U.S. has taken a further step in laying out a program,\u201d said Daniel Levy, a director of the Middle East Task Force at the New America Foundation in Washington. \u201cWhat Netanyahu is not doing on settlements led the U.S. to be more forward-leaning in its language than it has ever been before.\u201d\nAfter Mr. Netanyahu spoke, Israeli television news commentators said the settlement moratorium seemed aimed more at making peace with the Obama administration than with the Palestinian Authority. Relations between Jerusalem and Washington have soured over the idea of a settlement freeze.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/world/middleeast/26israel.html", "title": "Israel Offers a Pause in Building New Settlements", "author": "ETHAN BRONNER and MARK LANDLER"}
{"date": "Tue, 06 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea\u2019s leader gave an unusually exuberant welcome this week to the prime minister of China, whose trip was intensely monitored by the rest of the world for progress on efforts to halt North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\nBut the deal struck by the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China had far more to do with the two countries\u2019 shared goal \u2014 stability in North Korea.\nWhen Mr. Kim met Mr. Wen on Monday, North Korea said it was ready to return to six-nation talks on ending its nuclear program \u2014 but only if it saw progress in bilateral talks with the United States, state-run media in China and North Korea reported Tuesday. For months, North Korea had insisted that it would never return to the talks demanded by the United States, calling them \u201cdead.\u201d\nNorth Korea\u2019s reversal came after China signed a series of agreements that promised aid for the North and an expansion in economic exchanges, including the construction of another bridge across their tightly controlled river border.\nIn somewhat ceremonial language, the two governments also vowed to support each other \u201cfor generations to come\u201d \u2014 a pledge interpreted as a reference to the ill health of Mr. Kim and the possibility that the youngest of his three sons, Kim Jong-un, is being groomed as his successor.\nIt was unclear whether Kim Jong-un was formally introduced to Mr. Wen.\nA belligerently anti-American North Korea has often been considered as China\u2019s buffer against American influence in the region. China also wants to ward off an implosion by North Korea, which would endanger the stability of its own border area.\n\u201cThe results of Wen Jiabao\u2019s trip show that China\u2019s foremost concern is to secure stability in North Korea,\u201d said Han Suk-hee, an expert on Chinese-North Korean relations at the Graduate School of International Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cThe deals they signed are aimed at ensuring stability in North Korea even after Kim Jong-il is gone. China effectively announced that it did not agree with the United States and South Korea on sanctions against North Korea.\u201d\nThe joint announcement gave China something on the nuclear front to show the world \u2014 if only a vaguely worded promise to possibly return to talks \u2014 that might ease international pressure on it to do more on North Korea.\nBut the limits of the deal were underlined by the South Korean news agency Yonhap, which said North Korea was in the final stage of restoring its plutonium plant. That plant was mothballed after an international agreement in 2007 but revived in a fury after the North\u2019s missile and nuclear tests prompted new international sanctions this year.\nNorth Korea has repeatedly used negotiations over ending its nuclear weapons program as a way of extracting aid and diplomatic concessions from other countries. North Korea has so far received $2.2 billion under failed international deals aimed at persuading it to dismantle its nuclear facilities, according to a report this week by Kwon Young-se, a governing party lawmaker in South Korea.\nWhile the economic assistance China promised may elevate its leverage over North Korea, it may also deprive the United States and South Korea of theirs by sapping the strength of sanctions, analysts said.\n\u201cThis is a breakthrough for Kim Jong-il,\u201d said Chang Yong-seok, research director at the nonprofit Institute for Peace Affairs in Seoul. \u201cChina reconfirmed that it remained the biggest patron of the North Korean regime. It\u2019s a boost for Kim Jong-il\u2019s grip on power.\n\u201cBut one can imagine frustration in Washington.\u201d\nIan C. Kelly, a State Department spokesman, said the government was waiting to hear the details from the Chinese.\nSouth Korea said it had already expressed concern about whether the Chinese moves violated United Nations Security Council sanctions.\n\u201cWe are expecting China to explain the details of its economic cooperation programs with North Korea and whether they violated the Security Council resolutions,\u201d Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan told a group of South Korean news media editors, according to Yonhap.\nMr. Yu described Beijing\u2019s diplomacy as a combination of sanctions and engagement arising out of a concern that isolation and pressure alone would drive North Korea only to strengthen its nuclear weapons programs.\nChina\u2019s trade and aid have become more crucial to North Korea\u2019s survival, especially with South Korea refusing to send aid to the North during the past year and a half. Last year, trade between China and North Korea reached $2.79 billion, up 41.3 percent from 2007. That has slipped in the first eight months of this year to $1.6 billion, a fall of 6.2 percent from the same months last year.\nSome analysts say that China\u2019s influence over North Korea may be overstated.\n\u201cChina has long sought to parlay economic engagement into political influence over North Korea, \u201d said Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cBeijing\u2019s efforts, however, have been for naught. Despite extensive Chinese government largess and business engagement, the Chinese leadership was unable to persuade North Korea to abandon either nuclear weapons program nor prevent long-range missile launches and nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.\u201d\nEven in the North\u2019s discussion of returning to talks, it held to its longstanding approach of framing the issue of its nuclear weapons program largely as a matter between itself and the United States. \u201cWe expressed our readiness to hold multilateral talks, depending on the outcome\u201d of bilateral talks with the United States, said the North\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency in a report on the Kim-Wen meeting. \u201cThe six-party talks are also included in the multilateral talks.\u201d\n\u201cThe hostile relations between the D.P.R.K. and the United States should be converted into peaceful ties through the bilateral talks without fail,\u201d the agency quoted Mr. Kim as saying, using the initials for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the North\u2019s official name.\nWashington said recently that it was open to direct negotiations with the North to coax it back to the six-nation talks, which also include South Korea, China, Japan and Russia.\nBut both the United States and South Korea have said that bilateral discussions should not be a substitute for six-nation negotiations and that they will maintain sanctions until North Korea relents on its nuclear program.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/world/asia/07korea.html", "title": "China Aims to Steady North Korea", "author": "CHOE SANG-HUN"}
{"date": "Thu, 03 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "PERUGIA, Italy \u2014 An American college student charged with murdering her housemate in this picturesque Umbrian hill town told the court on Thursday she was \u201cafraid of being branded a murderer.\u201d\nIn a trembling voice the day before a jury is expected to begin deliberating her fate, the student, Amanda Knox, 22, thanked her family and friends, the jurors and even the prosecutors. \u201cThey are trying to do their work even if they don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said in Italian nearly perfected during her time in prison.\nIn a tale of junior-year-abroad-gone-bad that has drawn intense news media attention, prosecutors allege that Ms. Knox, then a student at the University of Washington, and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 25, killed her housemate, Meredith Kercher, 21, of Surrey, England, after coercing her into a sex game.\nThey are facing trial together, and prosecutors are seeking life, Italy\u2019s stiffest sentence, for both. A third defendant, Rudy Guede, 22, was sentenced to 30 years for sexual assault and murder, although the judge ruled that he was one of three assailants. All three deny wrongdoing.\nYet more than two years after Ms. Kercher\u2019s body was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the Perugia house she shared with Ms. Knox and two others \u2014 and after a barrage of press coverage and hundreds of hours of testimony from forensic experts and character witnesses \u2014 no one is any closer to understanding what exactly happened that fateful night.\n\u201cIt plays like a great crime story, like a television series,\u201d said Gianluca Nicoletti, a cultural commentator for Il Sole 24 Ore radio. \u201cBut in the end, years have gone by and what are we talking about? Who killed her? With what? With what motive?\u201d\nIn their closing arguments, prosecutors argued that Ms. Knox, high on drugs and alcohol and irritated with Ms. Kercher for being \u201cprissy,\u201d corralled Mr. Sollecito and Mr. Guede into group sex that ended with her slitting her housemate\u2019s throat. They claim the murder weapon was a kitchen knife later found scrubbed clean in Mr. Sollecito\u2019s kitchen with Ms. Knox\u2019s DNA on the handle and Ms. Kercher\u2019s on the tip.\nDefense lawyers say that the DNA was contaminated and is not credible, and that the blade does not match some of Ms. Kercher\u2019s wounds. In the absence of a smoking gun or entirely convincing motive, the telegenic and enigmatic Ms. Knox, who came to the police station as a witness and left as a suspect, has become an object of fascination.\n\u201cWho is Amanda?\u201d the playwright John Guare, who has followed the case closely, asked in an interview by e-mail. \u201cIs she Henry James\u2019s \u2018Daisy Miller,\u2019 the archetypal American girl in Europe who comes to a disastrous end? Is she Dorothy swept up into an evil Oz?\u201d Ms. Knox, he added, \u201cwith no history of violence, is a screen on whom we can project any identity.\u201d\nThe case is also freighted with race, a still uncomfortable issue in an increasingly diverse Italy. Ms. Kercher\u2019s mother is of Indian origin and her father is white. Mr. Guede, who has admitted to being at the house the night of the crime and whose DNA was found on Ms. Kercher\u2019s body, is from Ivory Coast. Ms. Knox first accused Patrick Lumumba, originally of Congo and the owner of a bar where she worked, of the crime; he was jailed and later released and is suing her for defamation. In testimony in June, Ms. Knox said the police pressured her to accuse him.\nIn the press, Ms. Knox is often portrayed as an innocent girl unwittingly caught up in the Kafkesque Italian justice system. But even one of her lawyers, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said that he believed the trial was fair. He added that he \u201cdisagreed\u201d with news media coverage that depicted it otherwise.\nBut to American eyes, many aspects of the trial can in fact seem baffling, even if they are perfectly normal here.\nMs. Knox and Mr. Sollecito were held in jail for a year before prosecutors moved to indict them. Although it began in mid-January, the trial has taken nearly a year \u2014 long by American standards but fast by Italian standards \u2014 because it has met only two days a week, partly to accommodate a powerful lawyer for Mr. Sollecito, Giulia Bongiorno, who is also a sitting member of Parliament and the head of Parliament\u2019s Justice Committee.\nThe case the prosecutors have presented is largely circumstantial, though even some American legal experts say it could be strong even in an American courtroom.\nProsecutors have cited records showing that Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito stopped using their cellphones around the same time on the evening of the crime, and began using them again around the same time early the next morning. Forensic experts have testified that evidence with Ms. Knox\u2019s and Ms. Kercher\u2019s commingled DNA was found in a room in the house where prosecutors allege Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito staged a break-in as a cover-up, for which they are also charged.\nMs. Knox has maintained that she spent the night of the murder at Mr. Sollecito\u2019s house, where the two smoked marijuana, watched the French film \u201cAm\u00e9lie\u201d and had sex. She said she went home the next morning and found the door to the house open and Ms. Kercher dead.\nMr. Sollecito has said he does not remember whether or not Ms. Knox spent the whole night at his house. His lawyers chose not to subject him to cross-examination, in part because his story does not entirely corroborate Ms. Knox\u2019s. On Thursday he delivered one of his few declarations in court, saying, \u201cI did not kill Meredith\u201d and appealing to jurors to give him his life back.\nUnlike in some American trials, where defendants often turn on each other, Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito\u2019s lawyers have mounted a common defense. They say this is because their clients are innocent. Yet the Italian justice system offers no American-style plea bargain, in which defendants admit some guilt in exchange for a lesser sentence. The closest equivalent is a fast-track trial, which Mr. Guede\u2019s lawyers asked for with the hope of a shorter sentence for him.\nThe jury of six civilians and two judges is not sequestered and has access to news media coverage of the case. They must convict if they are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt. In closing arguments on Thursday, one prosecutor, Manuela Comodi, told jurors that they did not require absolute truth. That, she added, was known only \u201cby God.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/europe/04italy.html", "title": "U.S. Student Delivers Appeal at End of Italian Trial", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}

Some witnesses said about 15 people were killed. Among the dead was the deputy commander of the African Union peacekeeping force, Maj. Gen. Juvenal Niyoyunguruza of Burundi, officials said. Top Somali commanders, including the police chief, were among the wounded.\nSeveral Somalis said the United Nations trucks had been stolen in either Baidoa or Jowhar, central Somalia towns that used to have a large United Nations presence but recently came under Shabab control.\nAround 5,000 African Union troops are in Somalia protecting the transitional government. Insurgents have relentlessly been attacking the peacekeepers, often with suicide bombs and roadside explosives. Somalia has been steeped in chaos since 1991, when clan militias ousted the country\u2019s last central government and then turned on one another.\nMany analysts and diplomats believe that the current transitional government, led by moderate Islamists, has the best chance to bring stability in years because it has grass-roots support. But its military remains weak and is widely believed to be infiltrated by insurgents, as the attack on Thursday implied.\nEarlier on Thursday, the Shabab distributed a statement to journalists setting conditions for the release of a French security adviser who was kidnapped in July.\nThe militants demanded that the French government stop supporting the transitional government. They also sought the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers, the French antipiracy warships patrolling Somalia\u2019s waters and the French security companies operating in Somalia. The statement also called for the release of Shabab prisoners held in various prisons.\nA spokesman for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bernard Val\u00e9ro, questioned the authenticity of the statement and said France stood behind current peacekeeping operations.\nThe French captive is one of two security advisers who were kidnapped at a hotel in Mogadishu in July. The other captive, Marc Aubri\u00e8re, held by the militia Hezb-ul-Islam, surfaced three weeks ago and gave a dramatic account of escaping.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/world/africa/18somalia.html", "title": "African Union Base in Somalia Is Hit", "author": "MOHAMMED IBRAHIM and JEFFREY GETTLEMAN"}

According to Press TV, a reformist member of Parliament, Mohammad Reza Tabesh, said the government\u2019s approach \u2014 holding prisoners incommunicado \u2014 had left families of the accused frightened. And the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based group, said the government was continuing to make arrests.\nThe group said a prominent human rights lawyer, Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, was arrested in his office in Tehran around 4 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe Iranian government is trampling over every rule of due process,\u201d Hadi Ghaemi, the group\u2019s spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cNot only are hundreds of detainees in incommunicado detention, in solitary confinement and possibly under torture, but their lawyers are rapidly being added to their ranks.\u201d\nThe arrests began when millions of Iranians turned out for demonstrations after the government announced that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had won a landslide victory against his prime challenger, Mir Hussein Moussavi, on June 12. The protesters, charging that the vote was rigged, made the single most sustained challenge to the state since the 1979 revolution \u2014 a challenge that has been quieted, but not ended.\nA flier circulating in Tehran, for example, asked people to turn on all their electrical appliances at the same time to crash the electric grid as a sign of defiance. There were also plans for new protests across Iran on Thursday, the 10th anniversary of violent confrontations that occurred when protesting students were beaten and jailed by the state. On Wednesday, government officials warned that protests would be considered illegal and that people should stay off the streets.\nPress TV said that Mr. Tabesh, the head of the reformist bloc in Parliament, met with the prosecutor general and asked him to use a \u201clegal approach\u201d to help ease the anxiety of family members. Mr. Tabesh said that a decision was made to release on bail those facing minor charges.\nBut Mr. Ghaemi of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said that more needed to be done, especially for those being held incommunicado, like a reporter for Newsweek, Maziar Bahari, and Bijan Khajehpour Khoei, an economist with diabetes whose health may have been harmed by his detention.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/middleeast/09iran.html", "title": "Iran Releases Protesters, but Still Holds 500", "author": "MICHAEL SLACKMAN"}

{"date": "Sun, 08 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 They are often tucked away in the rough-and-tumble sections of the city\u2019s south side, hidden beneath dingy hotels and guarded by men in dark coats. Known as \u201cblack houses,\u201d they are unofficial jails for the pesky hordes of petitioners who flock to the capital seeking justice.\nThis month, Wang Shixiang, a 48-year-old businessman from Heilongjong Province, came to Beijing to agitate for the prosecution of corrupt policemen. Instead, he was seized and confined to a dank room underneath the Juyuan Hotel with 40 other abducted petitioners.\nDuring his two days in captivity, Mr. Wang said, he was beaten and deprived of food, and then bundled onto an overnight train. Guards who were paid with government money, he said, made sure he arrived at his front door.\nAs Beijing hosts 10 days of political pageantry known as the National People\u2019s Congress, tens of thousands of desperate citizens are trying to seek redress by lodging formal complaints at petition offices. A few, when hope is lost, go to extremes, as a couple from the Xinjiang region did on Feb. 25: they set their car afire on the city\u2019s best-known shopping street, injuring themselves critically.\nIn his annual report to the legislature on Thursday, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said China should use its petition system to head off social unrest in the face of a worsening economy. \u201cWe should improve the mechanism to resolve social conflicts, and guide the public to express their requests and interests through legal channels,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the state media, 10 million petitions have been filed in the last five years on complaints as diverse as illegal land seizures and unpaid wages. The numbers would be far higher but for the black houses, also called black jails, the newest weapon local officials use to prevent these aggrieved citizens from embarrassing them in front of central government superiors. Officially, these jails do not exist.\nIn China\u2019s authoritarian state, senior officials tally petitions to get a rough sense of social order around the country. A successfully filed petition \u2014 however illusory the prospect of justice \u2014 is considered a black mark on the bureaucratic record of the local officials accused of wrongdoing.\nSo the game, sometimes deadly, is to prevent a filing. The cat-and-mouse contest has created a sizable underground economy that enriches the interceptors, the police and those who run the city\u2019s ad hoc detention centers.\nHuman rights activists and petitioners say plainclothes security officers and hired thugs grab the aggrieved off the streets and hide them in a growing constellation of unmarked detention centers. There, the activists say, the aggrieved will be insulted, roughed up and then escorted back to their home provinces. Some are held for weeks and months without charge, activists say, and in a few cases, the beatings are fatal.\nThe police in Beijing have done little to prevent such abuses. They are regularly accused of turning a blind eye or even helping local thugs round up petitioners. That raises suspicions that the central government is not especially upset about efforts to undermine the integrity of the petition system.\nThe petition system provides people with the semblance of an appeals process that top leaders hope will keep them off the streets. But for officials at all levels, it seems, the appearance of order \u2014 measured by reducing the number of petitions \u2014 is an acceptable approximation of actual order.\nRights advocates say that black houses have sprouted in recent years partly because top leaders have put more pressure on local leaders to reduce the number of petitioners reaching Beijing. Two of the largest holding pens, Majialou and Jiujingzhuang, can handle thousands of detainees who are funneled to the smaller detention centers, where cellphones and identification cards are confiscated.\nChina\u2019s petition system originated in the Ming Dynasty, from the 14th to the 17th centuries A.D., when commoners wronged by local officials sought the intervention of the imperial court. Since the Communist Party came to power, the right to petition the central government has been enshrined in the Constitution.\nWith few legal channels available, petitioners come to Beijing, saying it is their only hope for resolving grievances.\n\u201cI know my life is in danger, but I just can\u2019t swallow this injustice,\u201d said Mr. Wang, explaining why he has made 10 trips to Beijing in recent years, each ending in detention.\nChinese Human Rights Defenders, an organization in Hong Kong that recently interviewed more than 3,000 petitioners, has documented what it says is the lucrative business of abduction and repatriation. \u201cWhen you\u2019re taken to a black jail, no one knows where you are and you are totally vulnerable,\u201d said Wang Songlian, a researcher.\nThe authorities insist that there is no such system. During testimony to the United Nations Rights Council last month, Song Hansong, a representative of China\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Procurate, said, \u201cThere are no such things as black jails in our country.\u201d\nBut over the past year, rights workers have been gathering evidence of what they say is an underground network of jails, first established in 2005, that was aggressively expanded in the months leading up the Olympics.\nAlarmed by their unchecked spread, a group of lawyers has taken to organizing citizen raids that seek to free detainees through a show of force. Although they say instances of extralegal detention dropped after the Summer Games, one of the lawyers, Xu Zhiyou, said they had risen sharply in recent days, coinciding with the start of the annual legislative session.\nHe and other advocates say that armies of paid retrievers, euphemistically known as \u201cliberators,\u201d have been roaming the city in pursuit of as many as 40,000 petitioners, many of whom swarmed the entrances to the city\u2019s main petition centers during much of the week.\nBy Friday, however, the tough-looking throngs of retrievers outside the State Council and supreme court petition offices appeared to outnumber would-be petitioners, whose worn shoes and sacks of paperwork make them easy prey.\nWu Lijuan, a seasoned petitioner from Hubei Province, said she helped coordinate more than 10,000 former bank employees who came to Beijing from across the nation last week. She said most of the petitioners, middle-aged women seeking greater compensation for their dismissals, were rounded up outside the main petition office and loaded onto buses.\nThose who escape the dragnets are often betrayed by employees at the very offices designed to process petitions. Sun Lixiu, 51, a farmer from Sichuan Province, said a clerk at the State Council petition office asked for her ID card, handed back an application form and then tipped off retrievers, who took her to a black jail.\n\u201cNo one can be trusted,\u201d said Ms. Sun, who is seeking to free her husband from the local police station, where he has been held since July, after accusing town officials of embezzlement.\nThe financial rewards for apprehending petitioners can be irresistible. According to a directive obtained by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, the police in one Hunan Province county are authorized to spend nearly $300 for each successfully detained petitioner.\nThe money ends up in the pockets of the retrievers, corrupt petition clerks, and those who run the black jails. The organization said that officers in one Beijing police precinct demanded as much as $140 for each petitioner they turned over to provincial interceptors.\nThe story of Wu Bowen, 61, a retired shop clerk from Zhejiang Province, is typical. On Feb. 25 she came to the capital to file a petition seeking more compensation for the demolition of her home. The next day, as she sat on the curb, a policeman told her that as an out-of-towner, she had to register at the precinct.\nOnce there, however, the officer phoned the Zhejiang Province liaison office in Beijing. A short time later, a clutch of retrievers escorted her to a hotel not far from the city\u2019s main tourist attractions.\nAfter nine days of confinement, Ms. Wu stole back her cellphone and revealed the hotel\u2019s address to her son, who called the offices of The New York Times.\nWhen three men reluctantly opened the door to Room 208 at the Zhanle Hotel, Ms. Wu cried out for help. Confounded by the presence of foreign journalists, the men seemed unable to prevent Ms. Wu from escaping, although they begged her to stay, saying she could not leave until a local county official arrived with their reward money.\nOut on the street, Ms. Wu was shaken but undeterred. Asked if she wanted to be taken to the train station so she could return home, she shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay in Beijing until I get justice.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/09/world/asia/09jails.html", "title": "Seeking Justice, Chinese Land in Secret Jails", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}

She was 87.\nShe died at Rome\u2019s Gemelli Clinic from complications after a broken hip, said her daughter Priscilla Rattazzi Whittle of New York.\nSusanna, or \u201cSuni,\u201d as she was known, was the granddaughter of Giovanni Agnelli, who founded Fiat. Both the carmaker and the Agnelli family, Italy\u2019s answer to the Kennedys, came to epitomize Italian glamour and innovation during the economic boom that followed World War II.\nMs. Agnelli was a confidante of her dashing brother, Giovanni Agnelli, known as Gianni, who served as Fiat chairman for 30 years.\nAfter his death in 2003, Ms. Agnelli successfully rallied her siblings to keep Fiat in the family.\nNow led by Gianni\u2019s grandson, the company recently acquired a stake in Chrysler.\nA striking woman who let her hair go gray, spoke her mind and dressed smartly in pantsuits, Ms. Agnelli was the antithesis of the showy television celebrities who dominate Italian culture today.\nMs. Agnelli started a career in politics in the 1970s, when she became mayor of Monte Argentario, a village on the Tuscan coast where the family had a home.\nShe soon broadened her ambitions, serving as a member of Parliament from the center-left Republican Party and later as a member of the European Parliament.\nIn 1983 she was named undersecretary of state for foreign affairs, a post she held until the early 1990s. In 1995 and 1996 Ms. Agnelli served as foreign minister in the centrist government of Lamberto Dini.\n\u201cShe was the most efficient person that I ever met,\u201d Mario d\u2019Urso, a family friend, said Saturday. \u201cShe was able to obtain whatever she wanted, much more than Gianni.\u201d\nMs. Agnelli\u2019s son Lupo Rattazzi, reached Saturday, said affectionately, \u201cMy mother was a pretty bossy character.\u201d\nShe was active in environmental causes, and she helped bring an American-style televised fund-raiser to Italy that still raises millions of dollars annually for medical research.\nIn her best-selling 1975 memoir, \u201cWe Always Wore Sailor Suits,\u201d Ms. Agnelli recalled her childhood in Turin, where, under the tutelage of an English nanny, she and her six siblings were taught, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you are an Agnelli.\u201d\nBorn April 24, 1922, Susanna Agnelli came of age during World War II. At 20, she left a convent school in London to work for the Red Cross, serving on ships carrying wounded soldiers. After the war, she married Count Urbano Rattazzi. The couple had six children. They divorced in 1971.\nIn the early 1970s, when the Red Brigades were threatening industrialists in Italy, Ms. Agnelli lived for a time in New York. Sunday brunches at her home on Park Avenue became legendary, bringing together a wide range of notables including Senator Jacob K. Javits and Andy Warhol, according to Mr. d\u2019Urso.\nShe kept a home in New York until her death. \u201cShe loved New York,\u201d her daughter Priscilla recalled.\nMs. Agnelli is survived by her six children, as well as 14 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/world/europe/17agnelli.html", "title": "Susanna Agnelli, First Woman in Italy to Run Foreign Office, Dies at 87", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}
{"date": "Sat, 06 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama laid down a marker in Cairo last week for candor in American diplomacy. The United States, he declared, will \u201csay in public what we say in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs\u201d \u2014 a line that drew applause from his Arab audience.\nBut candor and diplomacy are not synonymous, and if Mr. Obama were to apply the same approach to thorny problems like Iran and North Korea, it might not produce the intended results, according to foreign affairs experts. Some say he risks forsaking the advantages of \u201cconstructive ambiguity,\u201d the diplomatic practice of fudging differences, credited to Henry A. Kissinger.\nAlready, senior Israeli officials are complaining privately that Mr. Obama\u2019s call for a blanket freeze in the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank contravenes verbal agreements between the Bush administration and the previous Israeli government.\nAs a practical matter, few analysts expect the Obama administration to rewrite the rules of diplomacy, which have always relied on a mix of public pronouncements, tacit understandings and back-channel talks.\n\u201cThere are two home truths in diplomacy,\u201d said Thomas R. Pickering, one of the nation\u2019s most experienced career diplomats and a former under secretary of state. \u201cOne is, don\u2019t tell lies. The other is, you can say more in private than you can in public, but they have to be consistent.\u201d\nOn the issue of North Korea, the United States is engaged in extremely quiet negotiations with China and Russia over how to respond to the North\u2019s recent nuclear test and missile launches. China, in particular, bridles at public pressure from the United States to crack down on North Korea\u2019s financial flows or to inspect ships suspected of carrying nuclear parts.\nIn this case, administration officials and outside experts said, the White House is likely to say little publicly about Beijing\u2019s role, aside from repeating the mantra that it hopes officials in North Korea will return to multiparty talks with China, the United States, Russia, South Korea and Japan.\nWashington\u2019s relations with China are founded on one of the most famous examples of \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d in modern diplomacy: the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9. In the agreement, negotiated by Mr. Kissinger, the United States implicitly acknowledged the existence of a single China, but left the language vague enough to maintain its support of Taiwan even as it normalized relations with Beijing.\n\u201cThere are times with authoritarian regimes that you are trying to nudge in a positive direction when you do not want to say things too publicly,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state for political affairs, who handled the talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program during the Bush administration.\nMr. Burns, who now teaches at Harvard, cautioned that such an approach worked only in certain cases. In other cases, he said, the United States needed to articulate its values clearly and publicly.\nIran may soon supply the White House with its next challenge in balancing public and private diplomacy. Until now, Mr. Obama has rolled out a series of symbolic gestures to the Iranian government: a videotaped greeting on Iran\u2019s New Year, invitations to July 4 parties at embassies and so on.\nBut at some point, analysts say, the White House will have to decide whether to pursue more substantive talks on issues like Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. Given the political realities on both sides, much of those negotiations are likely to be confidential and may involve a creative use of ambiguity on issues like whether Iran should be allowed to continue enriching uranium.\nSome analysts pointed out that Mr. Obama, in his reference in Cairo to Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, did not mention enrichment, suggesting, perhaps, that he wanted to keep his options open.\nWhat makes the president\u2019s declaration about public and private talks with the Middle East unusual, experts say, is that he applied it to Israel, one of America\u2019s closest allies. \u201cThe basic rule of diplomacy,\u201d Mr. Burns said, \u201cis that with allies, you try to solve problems quietly.\u201d\nWhen he was American ambassador to NATO in 2003, Mr. Burns said, he lamented that the United States and Europe did not try harder to hash out their differences over the Iraq war behind closed doors. In that case, two sides said the same things to each other publicly that they said privately. A result was that Congress began calling the French fries served in its cafeteria \u201cfreedom fries.\u201d\nSome Israelis, and their supporters here, cite their longstanding alliance in raising concerns about the very public settlement dispute. A recent letter to Mr. Obama, backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the United States\u2019 leading pro-Israel lobbying group, and signed by 328 members of Congress \u2014 declared, \u201cThe proven best way forward is to work closely and privately together, both on areas of agreement and especially on areas of disagreement.\u201d\nIndeed, Israeli officials say the Bush administration signaled in meetings beginning in 2003 that it would not oppose building in existing settlement areas to accommodate growing families, even though Israel pledged to freeze settlement construction when it signed the so-called road map for peace.\n\u201cI believe we need to talk with honesty and sincerity, and to try to keep the public discourse dignified and more moderate,\u201d said a senior Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to aggravate the dispute between Washington and Jerusalem.\nStill, Mr. Burns, who supports pushing Israel on settlements, said the Middle East might be a rare case in which candid diplomacy, even with an ally, makes sense. \u201cMost Palestinians and many Arabs have lost faith in the peace process,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the major issues for the United States is to regain credibility. This is a down payment the Obama administration is making with the Arab world, and they\u2019re saying it publicly.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/world/middleeast/07diplo.html", "title": "Experts Say Full Disclosure May Not Always Be Best Tactic in Diplomacy", "author": "MARK LANDLER"}
{"date": "Tue, 04 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A pair of nuclear-powered Russian attack submarines has been patrolling off the eastern seaboard of the United States in recent days, a rare mission that has raised concerns inside the Pentagon and intelligence agencies about a more assertive stance by the Russian military.\nThe episode has echoes of the cold war era, when the United States and the Soviet Union regularly parked submarines off each other\u2019s coasts to steal military secrets, track the movements of their underwater fleets \u2014 and be poised for war.\nBut the collapse of the Soviet Union all but eliminated the ability of the Russian Navy to operate far from home ports, making the current submarine patrols thousands of miles from Russia more surprising for military officials and defense policy experts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve put two first-line nuclear subs off the U.S. coast in about 15 years,\u201d said Norman Polmar, a naval historian and submarine warfare expert.\nThe submarines are of the Akula class, a counterpart to the Los Angeles class attack subs of the United States Navy, and not one of the larger submarines that can launch intercontinental nuclear missiles.\nAccording to Defense Department officials, one of the Russian submarines remained in international waters on Tuesday about 200 miles off the coast of the United States. The location of the second remained unclear. One senior official said the second submarine traveled south in recent days toward Cuba, while another senior official with access to reports on the surveillance mission said it had sailed away in a northerly direction.\nThe Pentagon and intelligence officials spoke anonymously to describe the effort to track the Russian submarines, which has not been publicly announced.\nPresident Obama spoke by telephone with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia on Tuesday, but it was not clear whether the subject of the submarines came up, although another source of friction between the two countries did. Mr. Medvedev called Mr. Obama to wish him a happy birthday and the White House said the president used the opportunity to urge Russia to work through diplomatic channels to resolve rising tensions with Georgia.\nThe submarine patrols come as Moscow tries to shake off the embarrassment of the latest failed test of the Bulava missile, a long-range weapon that was test fired from a submarine in the Arctic on July 15. The failed missile test was the sixth since 2005, and some experts see Russia\u2019s assertiveness elsewhere as a gambit by the military to prove its continued relevance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the military trying to demonstrate that they are still a player in Russian political and economic matters,\u201d Mr. Polmar said.\nOne of the submarines is the newer Akula II, officials said, which is quieter than the older variant and the most advanced in the Russian fleet. The Akula is capable of carrying torpedoes for attacking other submarines and surface vessels as well as missiles for striking targets on land and at sea.\nDefense Department officials declined to speculate on which weapons might be aboard the two submarines.\nWhile the submarines have not taken any provocative action beyond their presence outside territorial waters of the United States, officials expressed wariness over the Kremlin\u2019s motivation for ordering such an unusual mission.\n\u201cAnytime the Russian Navy does something so out of the ordinary it is cause for worry,\u201d said a senior Defense Department official who has been monitoring reports on the submarines\u2019 activities.\nThe official said the Navy was able to track the submarines as they made their way through international waters off the American coastline. This can be done from aircraft, ships, underwater sensors or other submarines.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known where they were, and we\u2019re not concerned about our ability to track the subs,\u201d the official added. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned just because they are there.\u201d\nOnce among the world\u2019s most powerful forces, the Russian Navy now has very few ships regularly deployed on the open seas. Moscow has contributed warships to the international armada searching for Somali pirates. In addition, a flotilla of Russian warships participated in exercises with Venezuela last year.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/world/05patrol.html", "title": "Russian Subs Patrolling Off East Coast of U.S.", "author": "MARK MAZZETTI and THOM SHANKER"}

The rebels\u2019 statement, issued on the Internet, came with a video of a Saudi armored personnel carrier burning, and of what was said to be fleeing Saudi soldiers.\nThe competing claims left a veil of uncertainty over the episode, in which Saudi Arabia \u2014 stung by rebel incursions \u2014 carried out its first unilateral military campaign in decades. The fighting began on Tuesday when the rebels overran a strategic mountain area on the Yemeni-Saudi border known as Jebel Dukhan, killing a Saudi border guard and wounding 11 others. Another border guard later died of his wounds.\nSaudi Arabia then began bombing rebel positions, introducing a new international element to Yemen\u2019s five-year-old civil war with the rebels.\nOn Saturday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s assistant minister for defense and aviation, Prince Khaled bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz, said \u201cthe situation is calm, especially in Jebel Dukhan, of which full control has been regained,\u201d according to the state-owned Saudi Press Agency.\nPrince Khaled said three Saudi soldiers had been killed and 15 wounded in the fighting. He added four Saudi soldiers were missing, the press agency reported, but he dismissed Houthi claims that they had been captured.\nThe border area is remote, dangerous and closed to journalists, making it impossible to verify either side\u2019s claims.\nEven if the fighting has ended, it seems likely that violence could flare up again, analysts said. The Houthis claim they initially seized the Jebel Dukhan area because the Saudis were allowing the Yemeni Army to use it for attacks on them \u2014 a tactic that may well be repeated.\n\u201cHas Saudi Arabia simply opened a Pandora\u2019s box, and laid the foundation for the Houthis to continue fighting them?\u201d said Toby C. Jones, an expert on Saudi Arabia and professor of Middle Eastern history at Rutgers University.\nThe episode has attracted widespread attention in part because of Yemen\u2019s claims that Iran is supporting the Houthi rebels, raising the specter of a possible proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nBut Yemeni officials have not offered any evidence of Iranian involvement, and the Houthis have always denied it. The Houthis are Zaydis, an offshoot of Shiite Islam that is doctrinally closer to mainstream Sunnism than to the Shiism practiced in Iran. However, the dominant form of Islam in Saudi Arabia is hostile to any form of Shiism.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/world/middleeast/09yemen.html", "title": "Saudis Claim to Beat Back Yemeni Rebels in Border Area", "author": "ROBERT F.

But if the reports were correct, the North Korean tests on Saturday were bound to raise tensions between the North and its neighbors.\nAfter a nuclear test by North Korea on May 25, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution that, among other things, barred it from testing ballistic missiles.\nA South Korean military official, speaking on condition of anonymity citing government policy, said the missiles launched Saturday were believed to have flown no more than 300 miles, indicating that they might be the North\u2019s Scud-type missiles. The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted military sources as saying the missiles were either Scud or Rodong missiles.\nA statement from the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military was \u201cfully ready to counter any North Korean threats and provocations based on strong South Korea-U.S. combined defense posture.\u201d\nThe latest launchings came on July 4. The North has a record of timing missile tests to coincide with Independence Day in the United States, as a way of highlighting the provocative gestures. Pyongyang fired off a barrage of missiles, including a long-range Taepodong-2, on the Fourth of July in 2006. The Taepodong launching was a failure, with the projectile falling into the sea less than a minute after blastoff.\nThe United States is currently is leading international efforts to enforce the United Nations resolution, which calls for a global embargo on arms trade with the North.\nNorth Korea has responded by declaring that it would conduct more missile and nuclear tests. Speculation has been running high in South Korea and Japan that the North might launch more missiles in coming days. It had warned shipping to stay away from its east coast through July 10.\nNorth Korea launched a rocket on April 4, in what was widely considered another test of Taepodong-2, designed to be an intercontinental missile capable of carrying a warhead as far as the West Coast of the United States.\nAttention has been focused on whether the North would attempt to launch another intercontinental missile, as it has said it would in the wake of the United Nations sanctions. But so far, spy satellites have not detected any signs of preparing a Taepodong launching, South Korean officials said in recent days.\nThe United States chief of naval operations, Adm.

{"date": "Thu, 10 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 England has long been a mecca for aggrieved people from around the world who want to sue for libel. Russian oligarchs, Saudi businessmen, multinational corporations, American celebrities \u2014 all have made their way to London\u2019s courts, where jurisdiction is easy to obtain and libel laws are heavily weighted in favor of complainants.\nEmbarrassed by London\u2019s reputation as \u201ca town called sue\u201d and by unusually stinging criticisms in American courts and legislatures, British lawmakers are seriously considering rewriting England\u2019s 19th-century libel laws.\nA member of the House of Lords is preparing a bill that would, among other things, require foreigners to demonstrate that they have suffered actual harm in England before they can sue here.\nEnglish libel law is the opposite of America\u2019s in many ways. In the United States, the plaintiff, or accuser, must prove that the statement in question was false; public officials must also prove that it was made maliciously, with \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the truth.\nIn England (Scotland has its own system), the burden of proof rests on the defendant, whose statements are presumed false and who has to establish that they are true.\nIt is not only news organizations that are running afoul of the law. Environmentalists, anticorruption campaigners, medical researchers and soccer fans posting criticisms of their teams on blogs have all been sued or threatened with legal action in recent years.\nThe justice secretary, Jack Straw, said recently that he was alarmed about \u201clibel tourism.\u201d And in the House of Commons, a committee has listened to a parade of witnesses denounce the current law as perverse, unfair, prohibitively expensive, contemptuous of free speech and an anachronism in an age when access to articles on foreign Web sites can be obtained anywhere.\n\u201cWe all have substantial and increasing concern at the potential of the English law of defamation to affect our work unjustly and oppressively,\u201d a consortium of foreign newspapers, publishers and human rights organizations, including The New York Times, said in a statement to the committee.\nNoting that \u201cone \u2018hit\u2019 in England is enough for a multimillion-pound libel action in London,\u201d the statement called England\u2019s libel laws \u201crepugnant to U.S. constitutional principles.\u201d It said that because of the threat of costly lawsuits, some American newspapers were considering abandoning distribution here and installing firewalls to block access to their Web sites in England.\nMore than 20,000 people, including Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist, have signed a petition saying that the laws \u201cdiscourage argument and debate\u201d and have no place in scientific disputes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quicker and easier and simpler to apologize and settle,\u201d said Simon Singh, the author of \u201cFermat\u2019s Enigma,\u201d who, having refused to apologize or settle, is battling the British Chiropractic Association over an editorial he wrote for The Guardian accusing the group of promoting \u201cbogus treatments.\u201d\nDespite the law, or even because of it, some British newspapers have a deserved reputation for irresponsible journalism.\n\u201cWe have a vicious, aggressive press here,\u201d Nigel Tait, a partner at Carter-Ruck, a law firm that often represents plaintiffs in libel suits, wrote recently. \u201cIt\u2019s all great \u2014 until someone writes something false about you.\u201d\nBecause it can be expensive and traumatic to pursue a case, aggrieved parties like minor celebrities may be reluctant to sue. As a result, the scandal-sheet tabloids tend to focus on them rather than on the rich and powerful.\n\u201cI have a friend who is the editor of a national newspaper whose board has said to him, \u2018Don\u2019t take on the oligarchs; we simply cannot afford it,\u2019 \u201d said John Kampfner, chief executive of Index on Censorship, which, along with English PEN, a group that promotes literature and human rights, recently produced a report on libel.\nA number of states, including New York, have passed legislation making English libel rulings difficult to enforce in American courts. Congress is considering similar legislation.\nThe catalyst for the New York law was the case of the American scholar Rachel Ehrenfeld, who was sued in the English courts by a Saudi billionaire, Khalid bin Mahfouz, after she accused him of channeling money to Al Qaeda in her book \u201cFunding Evil.\u201d\nThe book sold just 23 copies in England, but that was deemed sufficient to allow Mr. Mahfouz to bring his case here. Ms. Ehrenfeld, who refused to participate in the case or submit to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, was ordered in a default judgment to pay him more than $225,000.\nOther cases seem even more strange. Hannes Gissurarson, a professor at the University of Iceland, was sued here by Jon Olafsson, an Icelandic businessman, over critical remarks that Mr. Gissurarson had posted on the university\u2019s Web site five years earlier.\nMr. Gissurarson was ordered to pay \u00a355,000, worth about $89,500 at current rates, to Mr. Olafsson, who had moved to London. But the case was thrown out when it emerged that the British Consulate in Reykjavik had improperly served the initial legal papers.\nIn a farcical riposte, Mr. Olafsson then sued the Foreign Office, winning several hundred thousand pounds in a judgment this fall.\nIn another case, NMT Medical, a company in Boston, has sued a British cardiologist over criticisms he made about a clinical trial of one of its products at a conference in Washington in 2007.\nAn article about the issue was subsequently posted on an American medical news site on the Internet. The cardiologist, Dr. Peter Wilmshurst, said that NMT\u2019s lawyers then warned him that unless he retracted his statements, they would sue.\nHe refused. \u201cWhat I said about the trial is, in my view, true,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\u201cI feel I have an ethical responsibility not to falsify data,\u201d he said.\nRick Davis, NMT\u2019s chief operating officer, said that the company had taken action because Dr. Wilmshurst had \u201caccused NMT of research fraud, and done it in a malicious manner.\u201d\nIn similar circumstances, many would-be defendants, fearing financial ruin, simply remove the offending comments from the Internet as soon as they receive lawyers\u2019 warning letters.\nLegal fees can be dauntingly expensive. Mr. Gissurarson spent \u00a3100,000 on his case and had to sell his house. Dr. Wilmshurst has spent about the same amount, and counting.\nGlobal Witness, which campaigns on environmental and human rights issues, spent \u00a350,000 in less than a week deflecting the efforts of Denis Christel Sassou-Nguesso, son of the president of the Congo Republic, to force it to remove from its Web site a report accusing him of using national oil revenues to finance lavish spending sprees.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t discouraged us,\u201d Patrick Alley, director of Global Witness, said. \u201cBut a protracted case could bankrupt an organization.\u201d\n\u201cEven if a plaintiff is completely in the wrong,\u201d he said, \u201cthey could break you.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/world/europe/11libel.html", "title": "Britain, Long a Libel Mecca, Reviews Laws", "author": "SARAH LYALL"}
{"date": "Wed, 13 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "The following is a translation of excerpted audio recordings made by Zhao Ziyang, the purged Communist Party chief and former prime minister of China, who was removed from power in 1989 after he opposed the use of force against democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square.\n(Excerpts of the original audio clips from which the memoir is based are located at the left.)\nPart 1, Chapter 4: 'The Crackdown' (Pp. 33-34)\nOn the night of June 3rd, while sitting in the courtyard with my family, I heard intense gunfire. A tragedy to shock the world had not been averted, and was happening after all.\nI prepared the above written material three years after the June Fourth tragedy. Many years have now passed since this tragedy. Of the activists involved in this incident, except for the few who escaped abroad, most were arrested, sentenced, and repeatedly interrogated. The truth must have been determined by now. Certainly the following three questions should have been answered by now.\nFirst, it was determined then that the student movement was \u201ca planned conspiracy\u201d of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements with leadership. So now we must ask, who were these leaders? What was the plan? What was the conspiracy? What evidence exists to support this? It was also said that there were \u201cblack hands\u201d within the Party. Then who were they?\nSecond, it was said that this event was aimed at overthrowing the People\u2019s Republic and the Communist Party. Where is the evidence? I had said at the time that most people were only asking us to correct our flaws, not attempting to overthrow our political system. After so many years, what evidence has been obtained through the interrogations? Have I been proven right, or have they? Many of the democracy activists in exile say that before June Fourth, they had still believed that the Party could improve itself. After June Fourth, however, they saw the Party as hopeless and only then did they take a stand to oppose the Party. During the demonstrations, students raised many slogans and demands, but the problem of inflation was conspicuously missing, though inflation was a hot topic that could easily have resonated with and ignited all of society. If the students had intended on opposing the Communist Party back then, why hadn\u2019t they utilized this sensitive topic? If intent on mobilizing the masses, wouldn\u2019t it have been easier to raise questions like this one? In hindsight, it\u2019s obvious that the reason the students did not raise the issue of inflation was that they knew that this issue was related to the reform program, and if pointedly raised to mobilize the masses, it could have turned out to obstruct the reform process.\nThird, can it be proven that the June Fourth movement was \u201ccounterrevolutionary turmoil,\u201d as it was designated? The students were orderly. Many reports indicate that on the occasions when the People\u2019s Liberation Army came under attack, in many incidents it was the students who had come to its defense. Large numbers of city residents blocked the PLA from entering the city. Why? Were they intent on overthrowing the republic?\nOf course, whenever there are large numbers of people involved, there will always be some tiny minority within the crowd who might want to attack the PLA. It was a chaotic situation. It is perfectly possible that some hooligans took advantage of the situation to make trouble, but how can these actions be attributed to the majority of the citizens and students? By now, the answer to this question should be clear.\nPart 4, Chapter 2: 'Zhao Walks the Line' (Pp. 189-190)\nAnother issue was how to deal with people implicated in all of this. The Anti-Liberalization Campaign was not just a theoretical issue. My biggest headaches came from the issues of whether to punish people, how to reduce the harm done to people, and how to contain the circle of people being harmed. From the beginning of the campaign, some Party elders were also very enthusiastic and wanted to punish a lot of people. Deng Xiaoping had always believed that those who proceeded with liberalization within the Party should be severely punished. Wang Zhen and other elders believed this as well. People like Deng Liqun and Hu Qiaomu were even more eager to take the opportunity to destroy certain people and take pleasure in the aftermath.\nUnder these circumstances, it was difficult to protect certain people, or limit the number being hurt or even to reduce the degree of harm that was done. Hence when it was drafted, the Number Four Document set strict limits on the punishment of those designated by the campaign as having made mistakes. The document defined this as: \u201cPunishments that will be publicized and administrative punishments must first be approved by the Central Committee, and are to be meted out to those few Party members who openly promote bourgeois liberalism, refuse to mend their ways despite repeated admonitions, and have extensive influence.\u201d The document also stated, \u201cFor those who hold some mistaken views, criticisms by fellow Party members may be carried out in Party group administrative meetings. They should be allowed to hold to their own views and the method of carrying out the criticism must be calm.\u201d\nAt the meeting of national Propaganda Department leaders and on other occasions, I also spoke on how to win over the vast majority of people in the theoretical and cultural domains. I suggested we cooperate even with people with biased or false ideas. I pointed out, \u201cAmong Party members working in the theoretical and cultural fields, there are those who clearly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles but are a bit conservative and rigid; some are enthusiastic about reform yet have made statements that are inappropriate. We cannot just label the former as dogmatic or the latter as pursuers of liberalization. We should educate and cooperate with them all.\u201d\nWhen proceeding with the Anti-Liberalization Campaign, I had intentionally emphasized that we should classify those who had taken faulty liberal actions as well as those who were too conservative and rigid into the same group of people who were too biased. The purpose was to avoid or reduce the harm being done to people.\nPart 4, Chapter 4: 'Preparing for the Main Event' (Pp. 205-206)\nNevertheless, we had practiced socialism for more than thirty years. For those intent on observing orthodox socialist principles, how were we to explain this? One possible explanation was that socialism had been implemented too early and that we needed to retrench and reinitiate democracy. Another was that China had implemented socialism without having first experienced capitalism, and so a dose of capitalism needed to be reintroduced.\nNeither argument was entirely unreasonable, but they had the potential of sparking major theoretical debates, which could have led to confusion. And arguments of this kind could never have won political approval. In the worst-case scenario, they could even have caused reform to be killed in its infancy.\nWhile planning for the 13th Party Congress report in the spring of 1987, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to resolve this issue. I came to believe that the expression \u201cinitial stage of socialism\u201d was the best approach, and not only because it accepted and cast our decades-long implementation of socialism in a positive light; at the same time, because we were purportedly defined as being in an \u201cinitial stage,\u201d we were totally freed from the restrictions of orthodox socialist principles. Therefore, we could step back from our previous position and implement reform policies more appropriate to China.\nPart 3, Chapter 4: 'Finding a New Approach' (Pp. 112-113)\nThe reason I had such a deep interest in economic reform and devoted myself to finding ways to undertake this reform was that I was determined to eradicate the malady of China\u2019s economic system at its roots. Without an understanding of the deficiencies of China\u2019s economic system, I could not possibly have had such a strong urge for reform.\nOf course, my earliest understanding of how to proceed with reform was shallow and vague. Many of the approaches that I proposed could only ease the symptoms; they could not tackle the fundamental problems.\nThe most profound realization I had about eradicating deficiencies in China\u2019s economy was that the system had to be transformed into a market economy, and that the problem of property rights had to be resolved. That was arrived at through practical experience, only after a long series of back-and-forths.\nBut what was the fundamental problem? In the beginning, it wasn\u2019t clear to me. My general sense was only that efficiency had to be improved. After I came to Beijing, my guiding principle on economic policy was not the single-minded pursuit of production figures, nor the pace of economic development, but rather finding a way for the Chinese people to receive concrete returns on their labor. That was my starting point. Growth rates of 2 to 3 percent would have been considered fantastic for advanced capitalist nations, but while our economy grew at a rate of 10 percent, our people\u2019s living standards had not improved.\nAs for how to define this new path, I did not have any preconceived model or a systematic idea in mind. I started with only the desire to improve economic efficiency. This conviction was very important. The starting point was higher efficiency, and people seeing practical gains. Having this as a goal, a suitable way was eventually found, after much searching. Gradually, we created the right path.\nPart 3, Chapter 7: 'One Step at a Time' (P. 126)\nIn summary, there were two aspects: one was the market economic sector outside of the planning system, and the other was the planned economic sector. While expanding the market sector, we reduced the planned sector. While both planned and market sector existed, it was inevitable that as one grew the other shrank. As the planned sector was reduced and weakened, the market sector expanded and strengthened.\nAt the time, the major components of the market sector were agriculture, rural products, light industries, textiles, and consumer products. Products involved with the means of production were mostly still controlled by state-owned enterprises.\nIf the enterprises that controlled the means of production were not weakened or reduced, if a portion was not taken out to feed the market sector, growth could not continue for the emerging market economic sector. If no part of the means of production was allowed to be directly sold on the free market; for example, if small enterprises producing coal or concrete were all under central control; then the new emerging market sector would have run into great difficulties for lack of raw materials and supplies. Therefore, for more than ten years, though there was no fundamental change to the planned economic system and the system of state-owned enterprises, the incremental changes in the transition from planned to market economies had an undeniably positive effect.\nPart 6, Chapter 5: 'The Way Forward' (P. 270)\nOf course, it is possible that in the future a more advanced political system than parliamentary democracy will emerge. But that is a matter for the future. At present, there is no other.\nBased on this, we can say that if a country wishes to modernize, not only should it implement a market economy, it must also adopt a parliamentary democracy as its political system. Otherwise, this nation will not be able to have a market economy that is healthy and modern, nor can it become a modern society with a rule of law. Instead it will run into the situations that have occurred in so many developing countries, including China: commercialization of power, rampant corruption, a society polarized between rich and poor.\nPart 3, Chapter 3: 'Opening Painfully to the World' (P. 107)\nIn hindsight, it was not easy for China to carry out the Reform and Open-Door Policy. Whenever there were issues involving relationships with foreigners, people were fearful, and there were many accusations made against reformers: people were afraid of being exploited, having our sovereignty undermined, or suffering an insult to our nation.\nI pointed out that when foreigners invest money in China, they fear that China\u2019s policies might change. But what do we have to fear?\nPublished by Simon & Schuster, 2009", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/world/asia/15zhao-transcript.html", "title": "Excerpts From Zhao Ziyang\u2019s \u2018Prisoner of the State\u2019", "author": "Translated, Edited BAO PU, RENEE CHIANG and ADI IGNATIUS"}

{"date": "Thu, 06 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Iraq\u2019s cabinet announced Thursday that it planned to ban smoking from all public places, in what would be one of the first such laws in the Middle East. The restrictions may go even further than smoking bans in Western countries by outlawing smoking in \u201cprivate transportation.\u201d\nThe stance is particularly aggressive \u2014 and perhaps unenforceable \u2014 especially in a nation where cigarettes sell for as little as 40 cents a pack and smoking in public areas and workplaces is widespread. But it coincides with the government\u2019s attempts to improve living conditions here, like Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\u2019s order on Wednesday to remove blast walls from most of Baghdad within 40 days.\nYet even as the government tried to turn its attention toward these issues, the rough and tumble of Iraqi politics remained very much in evidence. The Ministry of the Interior released a statement on Wednesday clarifying its earlier announcement that a \u201cgang of bodyguards\u201d for Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi had been responsible for a bloody bank robbery last month. The clarification praised his help in apprehending the suspects.\nMr. Abdul Mahdi\u2019s media office then responded Thursday with a clarification of that clarification. The robbery did not involve a gang from the Iraqi Army unit that guards the vice president, his office said. Instead, it said, only one of his bodyguards was involved, acting with criminals from \u201cother units and institutions.\u201d\nViolence also continued to challenge the prime minister\u2019s plan to remove the blast walls and restore a sense of normalcy in Baghdad. On Thursday, two roadside bombs exploded in Mansour, wounding three civilians, and a bomb hidden in a displaced person\u2019s house in Dora killed a family member who had returned to check the house. A Shiite pilgrim en route to Karbala was killed when a so-called sticky bomb on the underside of his car exploded in Dora; three passengers were wounded.\nLate on Wednesday, followers of Moktada al-Sadr, an anti-American cleric, issued an unusual, handwritten statement in which Mr. Sadr denounced the government for bringing violent insurgents into its fold.\nThe statement stemmed from a deal Mr. Maliki negotiated with a Shiite special group to renounce violence against Iraqis and join the political process. The group, Asa\u2019ib al-Haq, had boasted of killing five American soldiers and kidnapping five British contractors, four of whom either have been found dead or are presumed dead. It did not renounce violence against foreigners. The group had broken away from Mr. Sadr earlier when he renounced violence.\n\u201cAny group that belongs to the resistance does not have the right to interfere in politics at all,\u201d Mr. Sadr\u2019s statement said.\n\u201cI advise the government not to engage with any military groups in general,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause they are against the Iraqi people and were involved in the spilling of Iraqi blood.\u201d\nIn the bank robbery, seven men entered the main branch of Al Rafidain Bank unopposed, apparently because of their official positions. The state-owned bank is in the Karada area, which is heavily guarded because many officials live there. The eight bank guards inside did not resist, but the robbers killed them all, possibly out of fear of being identified. They made off with an estimated $5 million.\nThe Interior Ministry said that it had seized five of the perpetrators, but that the two ringleaders had fled the country. One of them was previously identified as Capt. Lazem Dayekh, a member of the vice president\u2019s guard.\nMany people blamed political maneuvering for the dispute over who had supposedly solved the case first. Mr. Abdul Mahdi and the minister of the interior, Jawad al-Bolani, are rivals and possible opponents of Mr. Maliki in national elections.\n\u201cThere are political motives behind this crime,\u201d Mr. Abdul Mahdi\u2019s statement said.\nMr. Bolani was loudly criticized by the vice president\u2019s supporters when he made a similar charge a week earlier at a news conference about the robbery.\nAlmost as contentious will be the government\u2019s proposed smoking ban, which still is subject to a vote in Parliament. It would apply to all public buildings, government offices, movie theaters, schools and both public and private transportation.\nAl Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a largely Iraqi insurgent group with some foreign leadership, had tried to ban smoking in the Sunni communities it controlled, on religious grounds. Many local residents have cited that attempt as one of the reasons Sunnis turned on the group.\nIssam Shakir Mahmoud, 84, a tobacco vendor, did not think the plan was much of a threat to his livelihood. \u201cThe government cannot even control the security situation,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could they enforce this law?\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/world/middleeast/07iraq.html", "title": "Baghdad Seeks Smoking Ban", "author": "ROD NORDLAND"}
{"date": "Fri, 26 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 A bomb placed in a motorbike exploded at an outdoor market in Baghdad on Friday, killing about a dozen people and wounding scores. It marked the third straight day of violence in the capital before the Tuesday deadline for American combat troops to withdraw from Iraqi cities.\nAfter another similar bombing outside a billiard hall in Baghdad later on Friday that killed two people and wounded seven, the authorities ordered all motorbikes off the streets indefinitely.\nNearly 200 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in attacks over the past week in Baghdad and elsewhere in the country, with the deadliest attacks aimed at Shiites. The violence has raised fears of a new bout of sectarian warfare of the sort that ripped Iraq apart in 2005, and that could lead Iraqis once again to seek the protection of militias and armed groups instead of government forces.\nThe reaction by Shiite leaders echoed those concerns.\nThe bombing on Friday ripped through a market for new and secondhand motorbikes held each week under a bridge in the working-class neighborhood of Nahdha in central Baghdad.\nThe bomb was placed in a motorbike, Iraqi Army officers at the scene said, killing 10 and wounding 12. The officers spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were prohibited from speaking to reporters. Later in the day, an official at the Interior Ministry said at least 13 had been killed and 45 were wounded.\n\u201cTheir bodies were torn up to pieces, even their next of kin could not identify them,\u201d an enraged Iraqi soldier said. \u201cIt is Iraqi blood, but it is cheap,\u201d he added, pointing to a pool of blood.\nThe wreckage of motorbikes was piled on the back of a police pickup truck.\nMany angry onlookers at the scene said that Iraqi forces were to blame because of their lax approach and infiltration in their ranks by insurgents.\nThe same Iraqi Army unit is responsible for Nahdha and the nearby Shiite district of Sadr City, where a bombing killed 76 people at a crowded market on Wednesday night.\nIn Sadr City, hundreds crowded the street outside the local office of Moktada al-Sadr, the anti-American cleric, to attend Friday Prayer and to listen to a sermon given by one of Mr. Sadr\u2019s aides.\nIn a statement read by the preacher Harith Adthari, Mr. Sadr blamed the Americans for the explosions, saying they bore \u201cthe fingerprints of the occupation,\u201d and he urged people to help the loyal Iraqi security forces. He also noted that some infiltrators had penetrated the ranks of the Iraqi forces, and that they must be weeded out.\nThe prayer, which was attended by larger crowds than in many recent weeks, ended with a spontaneous demonstration in which marchers poured down one of Sadr City\u2019s main streets shouting: \u201cNo, no to America. No, no to occupation. No, no to terrorism.\u201d\nThat was followed by: \u201cYes for independence. Yes for peace.\u201d\nMr. Sadr\u2019s followers held similar gatherings in the southern cities of Najaf and Basra.\nAlthough a few people burned a United States flag in Baghdad, the general mood, albeit tense, was less inflamed than it had been at times. Mr. Sadr\u2019s statement counseled his followers to be patient, to pursue \u201cpeaceful resistance\u201d and to not give \u201cothers the excuse to attack you.\u201d His message to the Iraqi government focused on \u201cforcing out followers of the occupation and Baathists,\u201d members of Saddam Hussein\u2019s former ruling party.\nAfterward people who listened to the sermon seemed certain that the Americans were responsible for the bombing on Wednesday. They also agreed that Sadr City was a safer place when the Mahdi Army militia handled the security.\n\u201cAll the problems here are American; the whole plan of withdrawal is a game,\u201d said Laith al-Saadi, a pediatrician. \u201cThere is no withdrawal. They will still have their agents here, Iraqis and people from neighboring countries.\u201d\nHamid Jassim, 24, interjected: \u201cBefore, we protected our own neighborhood and other neighborhoods in Iraq. We have many unemployed young men who can start to take care of this job.\u201d He said they would not do that for now, since the Iraqi security forces were doing that job.\nIt was unclear though how long the restraint called for in Mr. Sadr\u2019s statement would last, or what it would take to undermine the resolve of Sadrist leaders to keep their movement nonviolent.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an attack on innocent people in order to stimulate the ethno-sectarian violence that was really a large problem in this country in the last couple of years,\u201d the chief American military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Stephen R. Lanza, told reporters this week. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to understand is the people have not responded to this.\u201d\nHe, like other commanders and Iraqi officials, warned of a rise in attacks around the withdrawal deadline, but he said the pace of violence remained on a downward trend.\nBut Sheik Hamid al-Mualla, a Shiite cleric and member of Parliament, said there were Sunni extremists backed by forces within some neighboring Arab gulf states like Saudi Arabia who were doing their utmost to rekindle Iraq\u2019s sectarian violence.\n\u201cI criticize the Arab silence toward the massacres that are happening in our country,\u201d he said in a sermon at Buratha Mosque in Baghdad.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, said Arab states had to take a \u201cclear and definitive stance toward these horrific crimes, because silence is no longer acceptable.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/world/middleeast/27iraq.html", "title": "Stoking Fears, Baghdad Bombs Kill About a Dozen", "author": "SAM DAGHER and ALISSA J.

But on Monday, seeking to garner political gain from the test, the North Korean media praised Kim Jong-il\u2019s leadership, insisting that a communications satellite was circling the Earth, broadcasting patriotic songs.\nOfficials and analysts in Seoul said the North\u2019s rocket, identified by American officials as a Taepodong-2, flew at least 2,000 miles, doubling the range of an earlier rocket it tested in 1998 and boosting its potential to fire a long-range missile.\nThe impoverished country may be years away from building a truly intercontinental ballistic missile and tipping it with a nuclear warhead. But to governments grown increasingly concerned by the North\u2019s military might, the launch was a sign that it was doggedly moving in that direction.\n\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s reckless act of threatening regional and global security cannot have any justification,\u201d said President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea in a radio speech on Monday.\nHours after North Korea\u2019s missile test on Sunday, President Obama called for new United Nations sanctions and laid out a new approach to American nuclear disarmament policy \u2014 one intended to strengthen the United States and its allies in halting proliferation.\n\u201cIn a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up,\u201d Mr. Obama told a huge crowd in the square outside of Prague Castle. \u201cBlack market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread.\u201d\nHe said the North\u2019s testing of \u201ca rocket that could be used for long-range missiles\u201d illustrated \u201cthe need for action, not just this afternoon at the U.N. Security Council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.\u201d\n\u201cRules must be binding,\u201d he said. \u201cViolations must be punished. Words must mean something.\u201d\nAt the Security Council on Sunday, the United States and its main allies \u2014 Japan, France and Britain \u2014pushed for a resolution denouncing the test as a violation of the 2006 sanctions, which demanded that North Korea suspend any activity related to the launching of ballistic missiles.\nDiplomats said a main issue would be determining if the failed launch violated any resolutions.\n\u201cWe think that what was launched is not the issue; the fact that there was a launch using ballistic missile technology is itself a clear violation,\u201d said Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador.\nChina left its position ambiguous, although diplomats said that at the initial meeting it stressed that the North Koreans had a right like any other country to launch satellites. \u201cOur position is that all countries concerned should show restraint and refrain from taking actions that might lead to increased tensions,\u201d Zhang Yesui, the Chinese ambassador, told reporters.\nIgor N. Shcherbak, the Russian deputy envoy, said that his country did not think it was a violation of the resolutions banning ballistic missiles, but he added that Russia was still studying the matter.\nMexican Ambassador Claude Heller, the council\u2019s president, said the council would reconvene on Monday.\nIn Tokyo, Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone said: \u201cWe feel that a Security Council resolution is desirable, so we will keep trying for that.\u201d\nAlthough the debris of the North Korean rocket fell hundreds of kilometers short of where the North had said they would land in the Pacific, \u201cthe launch carries big political and military significance,\u201d said Jeung Young-tai, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.\n\u201cNo country will be naive enough to believe that it was a peaceful space program,\u201d Mr. Jeung said.\n\u201cNorth Korea is on the threshold of becoming an intercontinental ballistic missile country.\u201d\nPeter Hayes, director of the Nautilus Institute, a San Francisco-based think tank, said the main motivation behind the launch was \u201cto demonstrate the strength and vitality of Kim Jong Il\u2019s leadership to the military and the population, and for the scientific sector to declare its fealty to Kim Jong Il\u2019s leadership.\u201d\nKim is expected to be re-affirmed as leader by his rubber-stamp parliament, which convenes on Thursday.\nThe people in the tightly isolated country have little access to news from the outside world, where the satellite launch was considered a failure.\nWhen North Korea first flight-tested the Taepodong-2, in July 2006, it blew apart 40 seconds after take-off. The rocket is designed to fly at least 6,700 kilometers, or 4,200 miles, according the South Korean Defense Ministry.\nThis time, the official KCNA news agency asserted, \u201cstorms of hurrays shook the room\u201d as the satellite entered orbit.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/world/asia/07korea.html", "title": "North Korea Seeks Political Gain From Rocket Launch", "author": "CHOE SANG-HUN, HELENE COOPER and DAVID E.

{"date": "Sat, 03 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 The grim case of a Washington-area toddler who died of heatstroke after his father left him in a parked vehicle for nine hours is national news in Russia, fodder for angry political commentary and kitchen-table discussion.\nThe boy, born Dmitri Yakovlev, was adopted from Russia, and his death in July revived memories of a string of earlier abuse cases involving Russian children adopted by American parents. But the real outcry came in December, when his adoptive father, Miles Harrison, was acquitted of involuntary manslaughter.\nOn Tuesday, Russian federal prosecutors opened an investigation into the boy\u2019s death, and the authorities have called to restrict or end the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\n\u201cWhen we give our children to the West and they die, for some reason the West always tells us it was just an accident,\u201d Tatyana Yakovleva, the first deputy chief of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d\nThe boy, renamed Chase Harrison, died on July 8, a little more than three months after he arrived in the United States. Miles Harrison strapped the boy, 21 months old, into a car seat but forgot to drop him off at day care. Nine hours after Mr. Harrison parked his sport utility vehicle outside his office, a co-worker noticed the child\u2019s body.\nMr. Harrison and his wife wept through much of the trial, and witnesses testified that they were loving and attentive parents, according to press reports. A Circuit Court judge in Fairfax County, Va., R. Terrence Ney, ruled that although Mr. Harrison had been \u201cplainly negligent,\u201d he had not shown \u201ccallous disregard for human life,\u201d the legal standard for involuntary manslaughter.\n\u201cThe only atonement can take place in his heart and soul,\u201d Judge Ney said, according to the local newspaper, The Loudoun Times-Mirror. He also said \u201cno finding of involuntary manslaughter will bring this child back to life.\u201d\nMr. Harrison\u2019s lawyer, Peter D. Greenspun, said Russian prosecutors had no jurisdiction in the case. He said that he understood Russia\u2019s interest in the case, but that calling to restrict adoption by Americans \u201cis really politicizing the case unnecessarily.\u201d\n\u201cThis was a tragic accident which occurred without regard to the country of birth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have been Guatemala, it could have been Kansas, it could have been South Africa.\u201d\nRussian officials saw it otherwise. In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said, \u201cSerious doubts arise as to the legitimacy of the practice of transferring our children for adoption to a country where their rights, primarily the right to life, turn out to be unprotected.\u201d\n\u201cIn the United States,\u201d it continued, \u201cpunishment is absent for those guilty of such tragedies on, apparently, the sole ground that they are \u2018full-fledged\u2019 citizens, whereas their adoptees are not.\u201d\nAt a public hearing in the lower house of Parliament, Speaker Boris Gryzlov declared himself \u201cindignant.\u201d Foreigners want Russian children, he said, because they are \u201cgenetically smarter and healthier.\u201d\nNews of the judge\u2019s ruling revived public outrage that was provoked in 2005 by the deaths of two Russian-born children after severe abuse at the hands of adoptive parents in North Carolina and Maryland. Both cases resulted in convictions. In addition, that year a Pennsylvania man was convicted of sexually abusing a girl he had adopted from Russia and of posting pornographic photographs of her on the Internet.\nAccording to the American Embassy in Moscow, more than 50,000 Russian children have been adopted by United States citizens since 1991. Fourteen adopted children have died of abuse in the United States since 1996, said Alina Levitskaya, of the Ministry of Education and Science. \u201cIn our Russian families, unfortunately, children die much more often,\u201d Russian newspapers quoted her as saying after Chase Harrison\u2019s death.\nUnited States adoptions of Russian children peaked in 2003 at 6,000, and have declined since, to 1,795 in 2008, as screening and legal hurdles have mounted. In a statement released after the verdict in the Harrison case, the United States ambassador to Russia, John Beyrle, said it would be wrong to severely restrict adoptions by Americans because of the case, which he called \u201ca terrible tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cWe should keep in mind the tens of thousands of extremely successful adoptions by Americans of Russian children, children who in many cases maintain a connection with their Russian roots,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we should think of the thousands of Russian children who do not have parents and who currently live in state-supported institutions.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/world/europe/04adopt.html", "title": "Russian Furor Over U.S. Adoptions Follows American\u2019s Acquittal in Boy\u2019s Death", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}

{"date": "Mon, 03 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 The doors of the communications revolution were thrown open in Iraq after the American-led invasion in 2003: In rushed a wave of music videos featuring scantily clad Turkish singers, Web sites recruiting suicide bombers, racy Egyptian soap operas, pornography, romance novels, and American and Israeli news and entertainment sites that had long been blocked under Saddam Hussein\u2019s rule.\nNow those doors may be shut again, at least partially, as the Iraqi government moves to ban sites deemed harmful to the public, to require Internet cafes to register with the authorities and to press publishers to censor books.\nThe government, which has been proceeding quietly on the new censorship laws, said prohibitions were necessary because material currently available in the country had had the effect of encouraging sectarian violence in the fragile democracy and of warping the minds of the young.\n\u201cOur Constitution respects freedom of thought and freedom of expression, but that should come with respect for society as a whole, and for moral behavior,\u201d said Taher Naser al-Hmood, Iraq\u2019s deputy cultural minister. \u201cIt is not easy to balance security and democracy. It is like being a tightrope walker.\u201d\nBut opponents of the proposals question why Iraq would seek to impose the same sorts of censorship that had been among the most loathed aspects of daily life under Saddam Hussein and suggest that they are another example of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\u2019s working to consolidate his power. The new policies will put Iraq more in line with neighboring Islamic states.\nThe new rules constitute a \u201creturn of dictatorship,\u201d said Ziad al-Ajeeli, who directs the Society to Defend the Freedom of the Press, a nonprofit Iraqi group.\n\u201cImposing censorship represents an end of the freedom of expression and thought that arrived in Iraq after April 9, 2003,\u201d he said, referring to the date a towering statue of Mr. Hussein was knocked down in Baghdad.\nIraq\u2019s Constitution is not clear on the matter. It guarantees freedom of expression, but only if it \u201cdoes not violate public order and morality.\u201d\nThe Constitution specifically prohibits material that includes accusations of being an apostate, a justification used by Sunni extremists to kill Shiites \u2014 and a particular concern to Iraq\u2019s Shiite-led government.\nThis month, the government has started to require dozens of Internet cafes to register with the government or be closed.\n\u201cWe are living in such a dangerous time that we need to control things,\u201d said Majeed H. Jasim, director of the State Company for Internet Services.\nThe attempt to limit access to information was prompted by a meeting in May in which Mr. Maliki asked his ministers to develop methods to halt material entering Iraq \u2014 whether via the Internet or over its borders \u2014 that advocated violence or included sexual content.\nIn July, a government committee recommended that the drafting of a law allowing for official Internet monitoring and the prosecution of violators be expedited.\nAmong the prohibited sites, according to the committee\u2019s report, would be those with subject matter including \u201cdrugs, terrorism, gambling, negative remarks about Islam and pornography.\u201d\nThis spring, the government contacted the handful of Iraqi book publishers still in business and asked them to compile lists of their books, along with a description of the subject matter.\nThe material is to be kept at the Ministry of Culture, which is also preparing a document to be signed by publishers in which they will pledge not to distribute books the government deems offensive.\n\u201cThere are books that are very dangerous, that invite and encourage suicide bombers, that explain the joy and pleasure and immortality that will come to those who perform suicide bombings,\u201d said Mr. Hmood, the deputy culture minister. \u201cHow do we deal with it? We will ask the publisher to sign a document promising not to bring such books into Iraq. We are not a security ministry, but we can help the security situation and make the publisher feel he has a commitment to follow the law and that he will be punished if he does not.\u201d\nBook publishers say the new policy could be the death knell for Iraq\u2019s once vibrant industry.\n\u201cAfter the fall of the previous regime we were optimistic,\u201d said Ghada al-Amily, manager of a Baghdad publishing firm, The House of Arts and Cultures. \u201cBut instead of activating and encouraging publishing houses, they are incapacitating them.\u201d\nTaha H. al-Shebeeb, an Iraqi writer of 10 novels whose politically tinged work often put him at odds with Mr. Hussein\u2019s government, called the current plans \u201can awful retreat.\u201d\n\u201cIf this is true, I will hold a press conference where I will burn my novels and say that I had been mistaken when I objected to the policies of the previous regime,\u201d he said.\nAhmed Mohammed Raouf, chief engineer for the State Company for Internet Services, said he had mixed feelings about censorship.\nHe held a similar position in Mr. Hussein\u2019s government and remembers being ordered to filter any site that was even remotely \u201cantiregime.\u201d\n\u201cWe are a technical ministry, not a political ministry,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is to bring the systems, the tools, but not to decide what can be said. We are engineers and technicians.\u201d He added, however, that \u201cthe situation had gotten out of control.\u201d\n\u201cDemocracy should also mean having a responsibility to society,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean there should be no limitations or restrictions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to stop a person from seeing a certain thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I also want to protect society.\u201d\nOnly a few hundred thousand people have Internet access in Iraq, according to estimates, but it is popular among the young.\nAmong the more popular uses are Facebook, dating sites and pornography.\n\u201cI like to go to Internet cafes for two reasons \u2014 one is to have fun chatting with friends and the other is to find some privacy because I like to look at porn sites and I can\u2019t do that at home,\u201d Mohammed Saad, a 19-year-old student said while sitting in an Internet cafe in the Karada neighborhood of Baghdad.\nBut other young people say they are encouraged by the possibility of a ban on some sites and want to extend the prohibitions to other technology as well.\n\u201cWe want to go back,\u201d said Yosra Marwan, a 24-year-old student. \u201cI do not like cellphones and the Internet and satellite television.

{"date": "Sun, 15 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Iraqis are in many ways taking to heart the adage that all politics is local, as Americans hand over to them ever greater control of affairs in the provinces. That local control, however, has brought more horror stories than successes in the past few days.\nIn Anbar Province, six former Camp Bucca detainees were on their way home on Friday when local police officers abducted and killed them in revenge for their days as insurgents, according to relatives of the victims.\nIn Wasit Province, a hard-line new police chief appointed by the prime minister has been transferring corrupt policemen out of the area, but local political opponents say that is the reason the local murder rate seems to have doubled.\nAnd in a remote part of northern Diyala Province, Iraqi soldiers surrounded a refugee camp for Iranian dissidents, Camp Ashraf, blockading food and water to the roughly 3,500 residents there. A spokesman for the dissidents\u2019 group, the People\u2019s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, said Sunday that only the presence of Americans had prevented an attack on them.\nAt Iraqi request, Americans are still running the sprawling Camp Bucca prison, near Basra, but they have been steadily releasing all but the most hard-core insurgents. On Friday, a group of 74 Bucca prisoners was taken to Mosul, in Nineveh Province, screened by local officials and released.\nSix of them had returned to their homes in Baiji when they heard that the police in Anbar were looking for them. They fled, but a police posse from Haditha hunted them down, handcuffed them and shot them repeatedly, killing all six, according to a leader of their Al Bonemir tribe, Salah Rasheed al-Goud, who was interviewed Saturday.\n\u201cOne of the police officers thought they had killed his brother more than a year ago,\u201d Mr. Goud said.\nA police commander in Anbar Province, Tariq Yousif, confirmed that the police in Haditha had recovered the bodies of six former detainees. \u201cWe do not have details; an investigation is under way,\u201d he said.\nThe killings in the southern province of Wasit were not themselves political, but many there blame the political squabbling between supporters of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and other parties for the increase in crime.\nLast December, Mr. Maliki replaced the police chief with Maj. Gen. Raed Shakir Jawdat, who had been the police chief in Karbala when Mr. Maliki ordered a heavy-handed crackdown there on followers of the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr.\n\u201cThe crime rate in Wasit increased 50 percent during the last two months, 10 to 12 kidnappings, and even murders targeting women,\u201d said Aziz al-Amara, commander of the Interior Ministry\u2019s security force in Kut, the capital of Wasit Province. \u201cThe party competition among Maliki and his rivals after he gained huge power from the election in Wasit has led to this increase in the crime rate.\u201d\nRecords at the morgue in Kut list 47 killings since January. Six of them were women, which is double the normal rate, according to an official there who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record. That number did not include so-called honor killings, he added, in which women are killed for transgressions against Islam\u2019s moral code.\nReached by telephone, the police chief vigorously defended his actions, but also said he was \u201chonored\u201d that he owed his job to support from Mr. Maliki\u2019s Dawa Party.\n\u201cThe crime rate reduced 80 percent,\u201d General Jawdat said of his tenure. \u201cSome of the armed robberies had been carried out by men in police uniforms using police cars, and I went after these guys.\u201d\nSheikh Muhammed al-Nuamani, a religious leader in Kut and a friend of the prime minister\u2019s, called General Jawdat \u201cthe greatest leader who has ever been appointed police chief.\u201d\nFar to the north, the Iranian refugees at Camp Ashraf have been a renewed source of concern ever since American forces handed over responsibility for the camp\u2019s protection to the Iraqi Army on Jan. 1.\nLast Friday, however, Iraqi forces surrounded the camp and cut off supplies, according to Shahin Gobadi, a spokesman for the dissidents, reached by telephone in Paris. Then, on Sunday morning, the refugees resisted an attempt by Iraqi soldiers to enter one of the camp\u2019s buildings, leading to scuffles and beatings of residents that stopped only when American officers there as observers intervened.\n\u201cIf the Americans leave, you will see a very serious human catastrophe and a massacre in this camp,\u201d said a camp spokesman, Shahriar Kia, who was reached by telephone. So far, though, no one has been seriously injured or killed.\nIn other developments on Sunday, the deputy commander of American forces in Baghdad said 90 percent or more of American troops in the capital would withdraw to bases on the outskirts of the city by June 30, as mandated by the Status of Forces Agreement between Iraq and the United States.\nThe officer, Brig. Gen. Frederick Rudesheim, said American forces would focus on preventing infiltration of insurgents from hiding places in the rural areas surrounding Baghdad. He stressed that American combat operations into Baghdad would continue in July, although only on Iraqi request. \u201cWe have to do everything by, with and through the Iraqis,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/world/middleeast/16iraq.html", "title": "With Local Control, New Troubles in Iraq", "author": "ROD NORDLAND"}

Mr. Inzko invoked the special authority, which will take effect on Saturday, to rescind the legislation approved by the Bosnian Serbs\u2019 National Assembly, the aides said.\nThe European Union and the United States are determined to maintain the Dayton agreement, which divided Bosnia and Herzegovina into the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serbian Republic, with a decentralized political system that appears to have reinforced rather than healed ethnic divisions.\nThe Serbian Republic \u201cis trying to renegotiate Dayton through political means, and this is extremely dangerous for the country because it was the Dayton agreement that ended the war,\u201d said Frane Maroevic, a spokesman for Mr. Inzko, who is known as the high representative.\n\u201cThe international community cannot sit idly by and let this happen,\u201d Mr. Maroevic added.\nThis latest dispute, one of the gravest since the war ended, follows months of political deterioration. It began last month, when Prime Minister Milorad Dodik of the Serbian Republic published a list of 68 powers that the Bosnian Serbs say the Bosnian state had \u201cstolen\u201d from the Serbian Republic; these included control of the judiciary and the power to collect customs duties, manage foreign trade and deploy the police.\nThe list was approved by the Serbian Republic\u2019s National Assembly. The lawmakers were essentially enumerating the powers that they thought the Bosnian state had taken over and implying that this authority should belong to the Serbian Republic.\nBosnian constitutional experts said the list was published in the Assembly\u2019s official gazette on Monday, effectively making it, and its implicit demands, law.\nMr. Inzko, a seasoned Austrian diplomat who was appointed in March, responded Friday by signing an order to invoke the so-called Bonn powers, which enable him to effectively nullify the Serbian Assembly\u2019s actions. The Bonn powers allow the high representative to issue decrees, impose laws and remove elected and appointed officials who he thinks are obstructing the Dayton accords.\nAlthough these powers have been invoked more than 800 times in the past 13 years to remove officials or to annul laws, Mr. Inzko tried in recent months to heed European pleas to avoid ruling by decree.\nGordan Milosevic, a senior adviser to Mr. Dodik, said in a telephone interview that the Serbian Republic had overreached by publishing the list, which he insisted was meant to be symbolic, not binding. He said the Bosnian Serbs had not intended to undermine the Dayton agreement and had merely wanted to voice discontent over what they viewed as the Bosnian state\u2019s accrual of power at the expense of elected assemblies in the two entities, the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serbian Republic.\n\u201cWe are against Bonn powers, which have no place in a democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Republika Srpska will behave rationally and is in favor of assuring the stability of Bosnia.\u201d\nMembers of the European Union are divided over how to manage Bosnia. Some diplomats said that Javier Solana, the organization\u2019s foreign policy chief, was opposed to invoking the Bonn powers. But aides to Mr. Inzko said that he thought failing to stand up to Mr. Dodik would undermine international credibility and that he had threatened to resign unless the Bonn powers were invoked.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/world/europe/20bosnia.html", "title": "Bosnia Serbs and Envoy Are at Odds on Powers", "author": "DAN BILEFSKY"}

At least 9 people were killed and 40 wounded, rescue authorities said. The attacks showed the wide reach of militant attacks in the Pakistani heartland, far from the troubled and lawless border region with Afghanistan.\nAuthorities in Multan said militants in a car tried to attack the intelligence agency offices with automatic rifle fire and hand grenades lobbed at a guard post. But when forces from the security agency returned fire, the militants blew up the car. Many buildings were damaged.\nAttacks in Pakistan have increased as the Pakistani Army presses an offensive against militants in South Waziristan, a stronghold of the Taliban and Al Qaeda along the Afghan border. The latest wave of bombings also comes less than one week after President Obama announced a new strategy for the region, sending 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan next year and offering closer cooperation with the Pakistani government. The Lahore attack at about 9 p.m. on Monday struck at a section of the Moon Market, where crowds of women shopped for clothes, witnesses said. Militants set off a second bomb moments after the first, engulfing much of the market in flames, and fired weapons at people fleeing the scene. At least one of the blasts was caused by a suicide bomber, police officials said.\n\u201cWe were busy dealing with customers at this peak time of the market when we suddenly heard the blast,\u201d said Jamshed Akhter, who runs a garment shop in the same market. \u201cAfter that we know nothing.

The attack, which occurred in the Allama Iqbal section of Lahore, also cut off electric power, complicating efforts to find survivors, witnesses said.\nThe attack in Lahore was the third on Monday. In Peshawar, 11 people died when militants struck near a courthouse. Four others were killed in an attack in Quetta.\nIn October, more than 30 people were killed after militants attacked police training centers and a federal building in Lahore.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/world/asia/09pstan.html", "title": "Twin Attacks in Pakistan Kill Dozens", "author": "WAQAR GILLANI"}
{"date": "Fri, 09 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "A. S. BYATT is an enthusiastic reader of Victorian novels, and in some ways she is a writer of them as well, or of updated versions. Her new novel, \u201cThe Children\u2019s Book,\u201d which was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize awarded on Tuesday, is 675 pages long and has a Trollopean heft and sweep; it starts in 1895 and ends after World War I.\nLike most Byatt books, it\u2019s stuffed with information: about pottery, puppetry, Victorian child-rearing theories, trench warfare, the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, the rise of Fabianism and women\u2019s suffrage. There are so many characters, Ms. Byatt said on Thursday, she had to use an Excel spreadsheet to keep their chronologies straight.\nMs. Byatt, 73, lives in London but was in New York to start a nearly monthlong book tour. She is a short, stout woman, well organized and self-assured. Her idea of bedtime reading is Stefan Zweig and Thomas Mann in the original German. \u201cI do it to avoid Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might work.\u201d\nBefore becoming known as a novelist, Ms. Byatt taught for many years, and there is still something donnish in her manner. She speaks quickly, in long allusive paragraphs that often end with a little joke or flash of sly wit. She has read so many books that her conversation can sound like a syllabus. Her current reading is about the art collector Peggy Guggenheim, because, she said, in her next book she wants to \u201cdo the surrealists and the psychologists.\u201d \u201cIf I survive this trip,\u201d she added.\n\u201cThe Children\u2019s Book\u201d is centered on Olive Wellwood, a famous writer of children\u2019s books, who lives with an extended family on a sort of Bohemian estate in Kent. The children run wild; the grownups are arty and sexually adventurous. Olive is loosely based on the writer E. Nesbit, and a great many real figures make walk-on appearances in the book, among them Shaw, Virginia Woolf, Rodin, Emma Goldman and Rupert Brooke, and Oscar Wilde on his last public outing before being imprisoned.\nThe creepiest character, and also one of the most entertaining, is a novelist and free-love advocate named Herbert Methley, whom the reader first meets while he\u2019s sunbathing in the nude. Methley, Ms. Byatt said, is a cross between H. G. Wells and D. H. Lawrence: he has Wells\u2019s predatory sexual habits and Lawrence\u2019s way of spouting off about his love life.\nOlive has a duller sister, Violet, who does much of the housework, and some critics have tried to read into her a dig at Ms. Byatt\u2019s younger sister, the novelist Margaret Drabble. The two have been estranged for so long that their sibling rivalry is a commonplace in literary London, where observers like to keep track of which sister is on top. At the moment it\u2019s probably Ms. Byatt, though Ms. Drabble recently published a memoir in which she took pains to remind readers that before her sister became the grandly initialed A. S., she was known simply as Susan.\nBUT the Olive-Violet relationship, Ms. Byatt said, is really based on an actual fact of E. Nesbit\u2019s life. \u201cA friend of hers, a journalist named Alice Hoatson, came to E. Nesbit one day and said she was pregnant, and Nesbit took her in,\u201d she explained. \u201cShe didn\u2019t realize that her husband was the father of the child. So Alice Hoatson moved in and ran the household and had another child with him.\u201d\nThe parentage of the Wellwood children is similarly mixed up, and in some ways \u201cThe Children\u2019s Book\u201d is a study of grownups, and artists especially, behaving very badly. Olive\u2019s husband, Humphry, makes a drunken pass at his own daughter on the ground that, biologically speaking, she\u2019s not strictly his. Another character, closely modeled on the artist Eric Gill, casually sleeps with his children.\nThe idea for the novel came to her, Ms. Byatt said, because she had been thinking about how child rearing changed in the late-Victorian era. \u201cPeople began talking to their children as people,\u201d she said. \u201cThey even took tea with them. That\u2019s a change \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t find it in Dickens or Jane Austen. And this also coincides with Freud\u2019s deciding that everything comes from childhood and discovering all sorts of little dark things there, even if they weren\u2019t true.\u201d\nNot coincidentally, Ms. Byatt went on, it was an era of great writing for children \u2014 Nesbit, Beatrix Potter, Kipling, Kenneth Grahame, J. M. Barrie. \u201cI think they wrote to prolong their own childhoods,\u201d she said, \u201cor the fantasy childhoods they would like to have had.\u201d And yet, she added, she couldn\u2019t help being struck by \u201call the children of the children\u2019s writers who killed themselves.\u201d\n\u201cI spent a lot of time thinking about Kenneth Grahame and I felt desperately sorry for his son, who was called Mouse. When he killed himself in the most obviously suicidal way, his parents said it was an accident. I think they had no idea who he was. When he was little he used to lie down in front of motorcars, and when you think how few motorcars there were, that would have been a huge gesture.\u201d\nSHE believed that at least one of J. M. Barrie\u2019s sons killed himself, she added, and she also brought up the instance of Alison Uttley, who wrote Beatrix Potter-like tales about rabbits and hedgehogs. \u201cShe wrote one of the best childhood memoirs I\u2019ve ever read,\u201d Ms. Byatt said. \u201cAnd yet she somehow sucked the life out of her son. He got married and Uttley didn\u2019t get along with the wife, and the son got in his car and drove off Beachy Head.\u201d\nIn the end, \u201cThe Children\u2019s Book,\u201d which Ms. Byatt originally planned to call \u201cThe Hedgehog, the White Goose and the Mad March Hare,\u201d came from what she called a \u201cconcatenation\u201d of themes and ideas, and she blocked much of it out while sitting in a hospital bed, recovering from an operation.\nWhen she put the chronology of her character side by side with that of figures and events from the period, fascinating patterns began to emerge. Ideally, she said, novels are like metaphors in which everything connects, and she gets indignant when people accuse her of dropping in bits of information for their own sake. \u201cThey\u2019re not there to instruct or entertain the reader,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re part of the web.\u201d\nMs. Byatt has three grown daughters (a son died in an accident at age 11) and is a proud, even doting, parent and grandparent. \u201cOlive Wellwood is not autobiographical,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s a much more erratic and passionate person than I am. I grew up with that completely fictive idea of motherhood, where the mother never strayed from the kitchen. All the women in my books are very afraid that if they do anything with their minds they won\u2019t be complete women. I don\u2019t think my daughters\u2019 generation has that feeling.\u201d\nShe went on: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible poison, writing. You just get to the point of your novel where you see the metaphor unfolding and you see the next three pages right in front of you, and the phone rings from school.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cAnd that completely interrupts your rhythm. Both E. Nesbit and Olive were more selfish than I am. They\u2019re convinced that their work is so important. I\u2019m not like that, really. I think there are a lot more important things than art in the world.\u201d She paused, and smiled before adding, \u201cBut not to me.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/world/europe/10byatt.html", "title": "A Novelist Whose Fiction Comes From Real Lives", "author": "CHARLES McGRATH"}

About 10 percent of the 1.3 billion people in China are ethnic minorities, according to government statistics.\nThe Chinese official, Wu Shimin, vice minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, said at a news conference on Tuesday that government policies \u201chad nothing to do with the violent crimes\u201d that unfolded in Urumqi, according to the China Daily, the largest official English-language newspaper here.\nAt least 197 people were killed and 1,721 injured, most of them ethnic Han civilians, when angry Uighurs went on a rampage the evening of July 5 after police officers tried suppressing a Uighur protest, according to the government. Vengeful Han, the dominant ethnic group in China, then attacked Uighurs the next few days. Many Uighurs in Urumqi say the government has severely undercounted the Uighur casualties.\nMany Uighurs, a Turkic people that is the largest ethnic group here in the oil-rich region of Xinjiang, express concern and frustration over a range of government policies related to employment, language and religion. They say, for example, that the government places too many limits on the practice of Islam. They accuse the state-run enterprises, especially large farms, construction businesses and oil companies, of discriminating against Uighurs in hiring. They also express dismay at the fact that the government has severely curtailed the use of the Uighur language in classrooms.\nMany Uighurs and foreign scholars say policies such as these generate fury among the Uighurs, especially among young men who cannot compete with Han migrants for jobs.\nWang Lequan, the long-serving secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang, has been blamed for shaping and reinforcing many of these policies.\nTibetans have expressed frustration at the same kinds of policies, and the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of the Tibetans, has pressed the Chinese government for greater autonomy in Tibetan areas. In March 2008, protests and riots erupted across the entire Tibetan plateau, presaging the recent unrest in Xinjiang.\nBut many Han say the government gives Uighurs, Tibetans and China\u2019s other 53 ethnic minorities too many benefits.\nFor example, they say, the government allows Uighurs to have two or three children without being fined, as Han are if they have more than one child. It also gives Uighur students extra points on standardized tests for university entrance. Other ethnic minorities are governed by similar policies, but the specific details vary with each minority.\nMr. Wu said that although the overall ethnic minority policies are working, \u201cimprovements might be made when necessary,\u201d China Daily reported.\nHe added that local governments might need to do a better job carrying out the policies.\n\u201cThe current policies include guiding principles set by the central government and regulations of local governments,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a deeper understanding is needed when it comes to making policies at the local level.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/world/asia/23xinjiang.html", "title": "Chinese Official Defends Policy on Minorities", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

Johnson, who declined to seek re-election in 1968 as a result of the turmoil over Vietnam, Mr. Obama replied: \u201cYou have to learn lessons from history. On the other hand, each historical moment is different. You never step into the same river twice. And so Afghanistan is not Vietnam.\u201d\nBut, he added, \u201cThe dangers of overreach and not having clear goals and not having strong support from the American people, those are all issues that I think about all the time.\u201d\nThe president promised to weigh the recommendation of the top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, on whether the United States should commit more troops. But he took issue with assertions that the job of dismantling terrorism networks can be handled by drones and other alternatives to soldiers on the ground.\n\u201cI assure you that if that were the case, you wouldn\u2019t see 68,000 of our young men and women deployed in Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\nIn the interview, Mr. Obama also addressed the repercussions from his decision late last week to levy new tariffs on tires imported from China. He said that his actions and China\u2019s response would not incite a trade war.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s in China\u2019s interests and our interests and the world\u2019s interests to avoid protectionism, particularly just as world trade is starting to bounce back from the huge declines that we\u2019ve seen in the last year,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nHe said that the decision would give him credibility with his labor union supporters the next time he told them a trade agreement was good for the United States.\nMr. Obama also signaled that he thought the need for a new economic stimulus package may have abated.\n\u201cI have a strong inclination not to do\u201d a second stimulus package, he said. \u201cI think that most folks believe that we\u2019ve now turned the corner where we might actually start seeing some positive economic growth in months to come.

Gates said Thursday that the United States might consider increasing payments to Kyrgyzstan for access to a crucial air base, just hours after the Kyrgyz Parliament voted to terminate the lease and require the Americans to vacate the base within six months.\n\u201cWe have not resigned ourselves to this being the last word,\u201d Mr. Gates said at a meeting here of NATO defense ministers to discuss the need for more combat forces and reconstruction teams in Afghanistan.\nThe base, in Manas, plays a central role for NATO\u2019s Afghan mission. It provides transit facilities for thousands of personnel and 500 tons of cargo each month, and it is used by the tanker aircraft that refuel fighter planes on missions over Afghanistan. The Obama administration has called the war there a high priority, announcing this week that an additional 17,000 American troops would be sent in the coming months. The loss of the base is seen as a serious challenge.\nMr. Gates said the United States remained prepared to discuss with Kyrgyzstan whether larger fees were warranted for use of the base, but he cautioned, \u201cWe are not going to be ridiculous about it.\u201d\n\u201cManas is important,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is not irreplaceable.\u201d\nHe said that American negotiators already were deep into discussions with \u201ca number of different countries,\u201d including Russia, about alternatives to the logistics hub in Kyrgyzstan.\nIt remained unclear how quickly the United States would have to find an alternative. President Kurmanbek Bakiyev of Kyrgyzstan was expected to send Washington an official notice, but American officials said they still did not know when it would be received or when the six-month countdown would start.\nThe bill in Parliament was approved by 78 of the 81 lawmakers present, with two voting against it and one abstaining.\nThe Kyrgyz government in Bishkek had longstanding complaints about the base and had asked for more cash compensation. Tensions were exacerbated in 2006 when an American serviceman fatally shot a Kyrgyz truck driver.\nMr. Bakiyev announced the move to close the base at a news conference with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, who this month promised to shore up Kyrgyzstan\u2019s struggling economy with about $2.15 billion in loans and grants. Moscow has long complained about the continued American military presence in Central Asia, and many in Washington concluded that Russia had encouraged the move in an attempt to assert its dominance in the region.\nAlthough Russian and Kyrgyz officials say there was no connection between the Kremlin\u2019s financial aid and efforts to kick out the Americans, senior American officials have complained that the Russians are trying to have it both ways \u2014 with the Kremlin expressing a desire to support the international military mission in Afghanistan while pressing the Kyrgyz government to end American access to its air base.\nIn public comments as part of the vote, Kyrgyz lawmakers portrayed the action as the culmination of years of complaints and said the American presence in Central Asia had outlasted its usefulness.\n\u201cIt is impossible to make people of Afghanistan live by standards which are brought in from abroad,\u201d said Kabai Karabhekov, a member of Parliament. \u201cOne has to give an opportunity to Afghan people to build their country themselves.\u201d\nThe shadow of Russian actions in Central Asia and Central Europe fell over the session of NATO ministers here, as Mr. Gates also was pressed on whether the Obama administration intended to move forward with a plan for missile defenses in Europe that had been a priority of the Bush administration\u2019s foreign policy and that had brought threats of military retaliation from Russia.\nMr. Gates, in his first overseas trip since he began serving the new president, said the missile defense bases planned in Poland and the Czech Republic would proceed if the technology proved it could work and was affordable.\nNeither of those two caveats were part of the Bush administration\u2019s language when discussing requirements for the bases.\nBut Mr. Gates also made it clear that the Obama administration had not yet met on the issue of missile defense policy, and that no decisions had been made on how to proceed.\n\u201cThe administration has not yet reviewed where it is on a whole range of issues,\u201d Mr. Gates said, including the missile defense program and how to manage that within the relationship with Russia.\nMr. Gates said the radar proposed for the Czech Republic and the 10 interceptor missiles for Poland were to counter a potential threat from Iran, and he reiterated that the United States would work with NATO and wanted Russia as a partner in the effort.\nTo reassure his hosts here, Mr. Gates said that a series of new bilateral military cooperation efforts with Poland were proceeding even as the prospects for the missile defense site on Polish territory remained uncertain.\nAlso Thursday, NATO officials confirmed that Germany had pledged 600 more soldiers to the mission in Afghanistan.\n\u201cWe welcome the commitment of additional German forces for the upcoming Afghan national elections,\u201d said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary. \u201cFor those contests to be credible, voter turnout must be robust and representative, and improving the security situation is the key to making that happen.\u201d\nItaly announced this week that it would add 500 troops to the alliance mission in Afghanistan by April.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/world/europe/20nato.html", "title": "Despite Kyrgyz Vote to Close U.S. Base, Gates Explores Options to Keep It Open", "author": "THOM SHANKER and ELLEN BARRY"}

He said Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had assured the Chinese that once the economy rebounded, the deficit would gradually come down from its current record levels.\nMr. Geithner confirmed that, saying, \u201cAs we put in place conditions for a durable recovery led by private demand, we will bring our fiscal position down to a more sustainable level over time.\u201d\nFor China, the rising American deficit is a concern because it could weaken the dollar and put at risk China\u2019s vast holdings of Treasury securities and other dollar-based assets. China holds an estimated $1.5 trillion in such securities, making it the United States\u2019 largest foreign creditor.\nThe unusual exchange between American and Chinese officials, in consecutive news conferences at the conclusion of the so-called Strategic and Economic Dialogue, underscored a subtle shift in power between China and the United States, one in which the Chinese are showing a new assertiveness as they seek to protect their huge investment.\nPresident Obama\u2019s decision to combine the longstanding economic dialogue between the countries with a strategic one meant that while finance officials tried to get their economic policies in line, diplomats were doing the same, especially on the North Korean nuclear program.\nChina\u2019s vice foreign minister, Wang Guangya, was unusually strong in condemning North Korea for conducting a nuclear test in May, and said Beijing would \u201cseriously and faithfully implement\u201d a series of sanctions enacted by the United Nations Security Council.

{"date": "Mon, 09 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The commander of a secretive branch of America\u2019s Special Operations forces last month ordered a halt to most commando missions in Afghanistan, reflecting a growing concern that civilian deaths caused by American firepower are jeopardizing broader goals there.\nThe halt, which lasted about two weeks, came after a series of nighttime raids by Special Operations troops in recent months killed women and children, and after months of mounting outrage in Afghanistan about civilians killed in air and ground strikes. The order covered all commando missions except those against the highest-ranking leaders of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, military officials said.\nAmerican commanders in Afghanistan rely on the commando units to carry out some of the most delicate operations against militant leaders, and the missions of the Army\u2019s Delta Force and classified Navy Seals units are never publicly acknowledged. But the units sometimes carry out dozens of operations each week, so any decision to halt their missions is a sign of just how worried military officials are that the fallout from civilian casualties is putting in peril the overall American mission in Afghanistan, including an effort to drain the Taliban of popular support.\nA United Nations report released last month specifically blamed clandestine missions by commando units for contributing to a surge in civilian deaths in Afghanistan in 2008. The report concluded that the number of civilian casualties rose nearly 40 percent compared with 2007, although it found that suicide bombings and other Taliban attacks were the primary cause.\nMilitary officials said the halt was ordered in part to allow American commanders time to impose new safeguards intended to reduce the risk of civilian deaths. They said it was also intended to help the military release information about civilian casualties more quickly, to pre-empt what some said have been exaggerated accounts by Afghan officials.\nAccording to senior military officials, the stand-down was ordered by Vice Adm. William H. McRaven, the head of the military\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command, which oversees the secret commando units.\nThe rising civilian death toll in Afghanistan has soured relations between American commanders and the Afghan government led by President Hamid Karzai, who has vocally criticized the raids.\nThe stand-down began in mid-February, and the raids have since resumed. It is unclear, though, whether the Special Operations missions are being carried out with the same frequency as before the halt.\nAt least two Special Operations ground raids in December helped fuel the tensions between the American military and Mr. Karzai. In one case, American troops raided a compound in Khost Province in an attempt to capture a Qaeda suspect. The suspect was taken into custody, but several civilians were killed and a 4-year-old boy was bitten by an attack dog used in the operation.\nDuring another December raid, American troops killed six Afghan police officers and one civilian in Zabul Province in southern Afghanistan. An American military spokesman called the killings a \u201ctragic case of mistaken identity.\u201d\nSome top civilian and military officials in Afghanistan say they believe that Mr. Karzai and some of his aides have at times exaggerated reports of civilian casualties to fuel anti-American sentiment for domestic political purposes. Mr. Karzai will run for re-election this year and is under political pressure to speak out against Afghan deaths at the hands of American troops.\nStill, there is little dispute that the increased intensity of American military operations in Afghanistan last year has contributed to the rise in the civilian death toll. As President Obama sends thousands more troops to the war-ravaged country, some officials worry that each civilian death may only drive Afghans toward the Taliban and other militant groups.\nOne senior official said that procedures had been set up to allow American troops to report more quickly the number of enemy and civilian deaths after a specific operation, and to quickly disseminate the information to Afghan officials in Kabul, the capital, and at the local and provincial levels.\nOfficials also said the military had adopted new procedures aimed at reducing civilian casualties, but they did not specify what those procedures were.\nCol. Gregory S. Julian, a spokesman for Gen. David D. McKiernan, who commands all American and NATO troops in Afghanistan, last week denied that there had been any halt to Special Operations missions. On Monday, however, Colonel Julian seemed to acknowledge that the stand-down had occurred, but he said his boss was not behind the order.\n\u201cGeneral McKiernan takes the issue of civilian casualties very seriously, but he did not direct the pause in operations,\u201d Colonel Julian said.\nGen. David H. Petraeus, who is in charge of American forces in the Middle East and Central Asia, supported the decision to suspend the Special Operations missions, according to a senior military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing classified military units. A White House spokesman declined to comment.\nGeneral McKiernan had issued a broad order on Dec. 30 that underscored the commitment of allied forces to reducing the risk of civilian casualties. He ordered that Afghan security forces should lead \u201call searches and entries of Afghan homes, mosques, religious sites or places of cultural significance,\u201d unless there was a \u201cclear and identified danger\u201d coming from a building.\nGeneral McKiernan\u2019s two-page directive followed American military operations last year that left dozens of civilians dead.\nIn perhaps the most notable case, American airstrikes on Aug. 22 in a village in western Afghanistan killed far more civilians than American commanders initially acknowledged.\nA military investigator\u2019s report found that more than 30 civilians, not 5 to 7 as the military had long insisted, had died in the airstrikes against what was believed to be a Taliban compound in Azizabad. The strikes were in support of allied ground forces, including American Special Operations forces.\nThe Afghan government initially insisted that 90 civilians died in the raid, and it never fully accepted the American military\u2019s revised death toll.\nAn Official\u2019s Grim Assessment\nPARIS \u2014 As the United States prepares to commit 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan, the commander of NATO and American forces there said Monday that the coalition was \u201cnot winning\u201d the war against the resurgent Taliban in parts of the country.\nThe commander, Gen. David D. McKiernan, said there were areas in the north, east and west where coalition and Afghan forces were winning the battle to curb the Taliban.\n\u201cBut there are other areas \u2014 large areas in the southern part of Afghanistan especially, but in parts of the east \u2014 where we are not winning,\u201d he said in an interview with the BBC.\n\u201cMore has to happen along multiple lines of operation in order for anybody by any metric to say that the Afghans are winning or the efforts of the coalition are winning,\u201d he said.\nPresident Obama also said recently that the United States was not winning the Afghan war.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/world/asia/10terror.html", "title": "U.S. Halted Some Raids in Afghanistan", "author": "MARK MAZZETTI and ERIC SCHMITT"}

By the end of this month, the United States is required to withdraw combat troops from Iraq\u2019s cities and, by the end of 2011, from the entire country.\nSome legislation that could help strengthen and diversify the economy has been awaiting passage in Parliament for as long as three years, even as large numbers of Iraqis live in poverty and without adequate housing, health care and other basic needs.\n\u201cIf there was decent electricity and clean drinking water, there might be more patience from people,\u201d said Haider Ala Hamoudi, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, who has advised the Iraqi government on legal issues. \u201cBut on some of these laws, especially the ones that aren\u2019t controversial, Parliament has to do something or it risks losing legitimacy.\u201d\nPrime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who some members of Parliament blame for holding up several bills, has become so frustrated with the slow pace that he has began to lobby publicly for a switch to a presidential system, including holding direct elections for the nation\u2019s leader.\n\u201cParliament\u2019s system of democratic consensus is strange, conflicts with democracy and has many inherent problems,\u201d Mr. Maliki said recently. \u201cI think the presidential system is better than the parliamentary system if it will be accountable to the people.\u201d\nElected in 2005 as Iraq\u2019s first democratic national legislature, Parliament\u2019s inaugural class was entrusted with leading the nation to a firm footing as a representative democracy.\nInstead, the body has become a source of frustration in the country and something of an embarrassment, even to some of its members. A member\u2019s salary and benefits \u2014 worth about $125,000 annually \u2014 are more than 20 times that of the average Iraqi.\nNot only have its members been accused of being badly out of touch, but the body is far better known among Iraqis for listlessness and sectarian squabbling than for passing laws.\n\u201cParliament hasn\u2019t worked hard to send people the message that they are pushing the government to do its best to improve services,\u201d said Sami al-Atroshi, a Kurdish member of Parliament. \u201cOrdinary people have a right to feel negatively about us.\u201d\nAmong the crucial measures waiting to be enacted is the hydrocarbons law, also known as the gas and oil law. Without rules governing the extraction of its huge oil reserves, it has been difficult for Iraq to attract foreign investment to its petroleum industry, which accounts for 95 percent of foreign exchange earnings.\nAnother critical bill would impose disclosure rules on political parties, which are currently allowed to accept donations of any size without reporting the source, leading to accusations that some of Iraq\u2019s leading Shiite political organizations are financed by Iran.\nThere is legislation that would grant additional powers to the country\u2019s president; provide for revenue sharing between the central government and the provinces; and possibly engineer a political solution for the disputed province of Kirkuk. Also languishing are statutes regarding foreign investment, the environment, elections, price fixing, political corruption, consumer protection, intellectual property rights, building codes and even the design of a new national flag.\nThe laws are so pivotal and the ethnic and sectarian issues surrounding them so intractable that some members say Parliament should not take them up at all. Others believe that most, if not all, of the contentious legislation should wait until after parliamentary elections in January.\n\u201cSome of these things are bigger than the current Parliament and the current government can deal with,\u201d said Sheik Mohammed al-Hemedawi, a Shiite member of Parliament, who said some of the bills could spark new sectarian and ethnic violence. \u201cWe will thank God if we are able to do some of it, but all of it together is too much for us.\u201d\nAmerican officials, who have sometimes stepped in to broker peace between warring blocs, had hoped Parliament could move the country to post-sectarianism. But all too often disputes culminate in walkouts by groups of Shiite or Sunnis or Kurdish lawmakers.\nA chief problem is that members lack the confidence to make compromises in the national interest, and they instead focus on scoring points with their sectarian and ethnic bases. The result is often a political standstill.\nSessions frequently dissolve into desk-pounding protests, fistfights, resignations and even demands that the body vote to disband itself. For a time, even quorums were difficult to achieve because members spent months outside the country. The former speaker, Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, once described his colleagues as \u201cthugs, spies and lawmakers who never show up to Parliament.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, the new speaker, Ayad al-Sammaraie, from the Sunni Iraqi Islamic Party, has sought to animate Parliament by focusing on its role as a watchdog on the government of Mr. Maliki.\nThe body had a rare victory earlier this month when Falah al-Sudani, the country\u2019s trade minister, resigned after being summoned to Parliament to answer questions about allegations of corruption in his ministry.\nMr. Sammaraie recently acknowledged that Parliament had been too slow to pass legislation. He pinned some blame on the prime minister\u2019s office for abruptly withdrawing some bills, which has resulted in delays, but said much of the fault lay with Parliament itself.\n\u201cWe need to enact laws,\u201d he said.\nFor now, the aims remain modest. Umer al-Mashhadani, a spokesman for Sammaraie, said one goal was to restore live television broadcasts of Parliament\u2019s sessions.\nThe meetings have been broadcast on tape delay after officials decided that Parliament\u2019s arguments, charges and countercharges had dangerously roused sectarian tensions among the public.\nSome members defended Parliament, saying that much of its work had been hampered by violence, including a 2007 suicide bomb attack in Parliament\u2019s cafeteria that killed eight people, including two members of Parliament.\n\u201cWe were working in a very tense period when we were routinely threatened when we left our houses,\u201d said Mr. Hemedawi, the Shiite member of Parliament. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if we would come back home. But now, things are better. We are proud to have built the new Iraq.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/world/middleeast/22iraq.html", "title": "Laws Lag in Iraq, as Patience Wears Thin", "author": "TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and SUADAD AL-SALHY"}
{"date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 More than 10,000 protesters gathered in Kiev on Friday to demand a change of government in Ukraine, and President Viktor A. Yushchenko said he was considering calling early presidential and parliamentary elections.\n\u201cI am not afraid of any early elections, including presidential polls,\u201d Mr. Yushchenko said at a news conference. Previously, he has advocated sticking to the present schedule, which calls for presidential elections in January 2010.\nProtesters carrying signs reading \u201cUkraine\u2019s Government is Ukraine\u2019s Shame!\u201d gathered in Independence Square, where crowds swept Mr. Yushchenko\u2019s pro-Western coalition into office five years ago.\nThe police estimated the crowd at 8,000, but other estimates were as high as 20,000. It was the second protest in two weeks by the pro-Russia Party of Regions, which blames Ukraine\u2019s leadership for failing to cope with the economic downturn.\nTo roars of approval, Viktor F. Yanukovich, the party\u2019s leader, told protesters that the economy would not recover until the present leadership was gone.\n\u201cI think everyone who has come to this square has one big wish \u2014 to change life for the better,\u201d said Mr. Yanukovich, who is expected to run for president in the coming elections, according to text posted on his Web site.\n\u201cAnd there is only one way to do this, when we are rid of those now in power,\u201d he said.\nThe demonstrations came at the end of a tumultuous week. On Wednesday, an overwhelming majority in Ukraine\u2019s Parliament voted to hold presidential elections on Oct. 25. On Thursday, deputies from the Party of Regions swarmed the podium in the legislature, blocking the doors ahead of an important vote on measures demanded by the International Monetary Fund as a condition of a $16.4 billion loan.\nThe political turmoil in Ukraine has been heightened by an economic free fall, as global demand for steel, Ukraine\u2019s biggest export, has plummeted.\nThe Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia, has lost 40 percent of its value compared to the dollar, and the country is now heavily dependent on the I.M.F. loan.\nSupport for Mr. Yushchenko, who came to power in the so-called Orange Revolution, has dropped to 3 percent.\nBoris M. Pogrebinsky, the director of the Kiev Center for Political and Conflict Studies, said Mr. Yushchenko\u2019s change of heart on early presidential elections was unexpected. If a presidential election were held today, he said, it would likely end in a runoff between Mr. Yanukovich and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who would split the popular vote between them. The result of that runoff would depend on the economy, he said.\n\u201cIt is impossible to predict this situation, absolutely impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt changes every day.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/world/europe/04ukraine.html", "title": "Thousands Join Anti-Government Rally in Ukraine", "author": "ELLEN BARRY"}
{"date": "Mon, 09 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JOHANNESBURG \u2014 A mutiny within the military has intensified the political crisis in Madagascar, an impoverished island nation off the southeastern coast of Africa that has suffered turmoil most of this year.\nOver the weekend, soldiers at Camp Capsat, on the outskirts of the Malagasy capital, Antananarivo, said they would refuse to further suppress any street demonstrations against the government of President Marc Ravalomanana.\nCol. No\u00ebl Rakotonandrasana, a leader of the restive troops, claimed wide support within the army and told reporters on Monday that \u201c75 percent of soldiers are with us,\u201d Reuters reported. He was flanked by other officers, but it was impossible to gauge the extent of the military\u2019s defiance.\nThere were rumors that the camp was about to come under attack by troops loyal to the government. Mutinying soldiers were deployed at a roadblock that limited access to the base. Some said their disobedience was rooted in a refusal to take up arms against their countrymen.\n\u201cWe were trained to protect property and citizens, not to fire at the people,\u201d one of the men told Agence France-Presse.\nIn recent weeks, mass demonstrations against the government have become common events, including a protest that left at least 28 people dead on Feb. 7 after the presidential guard opened fire on a crowd near one of the presidential palaces.\nThe political conflict involves a rivalry between Mr. Ravalomanana, a wealthy businessman who took office after elections in 2001, and Andry Rajoelina, a media magnate and former disc jockey who was elected mayor of the capital in December 2007 and has of late denounced the president as a dictator insensitive to the needs of the nation. More than 100 people have died in civil unrest this year.\nAt a Jan. 31 rally, Mr. Rajoelina proclaimed that he was in charge of the nation, in effect declaring a coup. In response, President Ravalomanana fired his rival as the capital\u2019s mayor. Representatives from both the United Nations and the African Union have unsuccessfully tried to mediate.\nOn Friday, security officers went to Mr. Rajoelina\u2019s home in an effort to arrest him. The 34-year-old maverick slipped away. He remains in hiding.\n\u201cAt the heart of the current crisis is a political problem,\u201d Defense Minister Mamy Ranaivoniarivo said Monday in a statement, reacting to the mutiny. \u201cThe military should not be manipulated and divided by the crisis.\u201d\nAndry Ralijaona, an official within the presidency, said in a phone interview that the number of mutineers was 70 to 110, \u201ca small amount when there are 1,000 soldiers\u201d around the capital. He added, however, that the disaffected troops had access to a \u201cwarehouse of munitions and arms.\u201d\nThe complaints of the mutineers, Mr. Ralijaona said, concerned more than dislike of their duty at the protests. Grievances also involved pay and allegations that superiors were embezzling funds.\nAccording to Mr. Ralijaona, the disaffected soldiers, abetted by violent supporters of former Mayor Rajoelina, killed a policeman on Sunday and hung his body from a billboard. \u201cThey killed another person today, but the circumstances are not yet clear,\u201d Mr. Ralijaona said.\nMadagascar, the world\u2019s fourth largest island, is home to 20 million people. While the former French colony is perhaps best known internationally as a biological wonderland \u2014 a home to rare species of lemurs and chameleons \u2014 it is also a place of abysmal poverty, with more than half the population scraping by on less than $1 a day.\nMr. Rajoelina\u2019s campaign against the president has tapped into widespread feelings that not enough is being done to lift the masses from penury.\nLike Mr. Ravalomanana, 59, who made his fortune manufacturing dairy products, the former mayor is quite wealthy. Mr. Rajoelina owns his own television and radio stations and has the support of many Malagasy entertainers.\nOn Monday, hundreds of Mr. Rajoelina\u2019s supporters held a rally at their favorite spot: the May 13 Square in the capital, the epicenter of earlier political movements. No soldiers interfered, and later in the afternoon a peaceful counterdemonstration began in front of a soccer stadium not far away.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/world/africa/10madagascar.html", "title": "Army Mutiny Heightens Madagascar Crisis", "author": "BARRY BEARAK"}

And now Mexico\u2019s drug cartels may have their hands in a new activity: street protests.\nA wave of demonstrations protesting the presence of army troops has swept through towns and cities across northern Mexico in recent days. The protesters have temporarily blocked border crossings in Reynosa, Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and shut down parts of Monterrey, a major industrial hub in the northeast.\nWithout providing evidence, the Mexican authorities say they see the hidden hand of traffickers in the splashy events, which have included men, women and children, some of whom cover their faces as they wave placards and denounce President Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s decision to deploy more than 40,000 soldiers to combat a booming drug trade.\nMexican political parties have a long history of paying people to protest. The compensation can come in the form of a free lunch, cash or gifts. Those who turn out provide the outrage.\nThe governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n state, Jos\u00e9 Natividad Gonz\u00e1lez Par\u00e1s, cited a paramilitary group as the instigator of the recent rallies. The group, Los Zetas, is made up largely of former soldiers who now act as enforcers for the powerful Gulf Cartel. \u201cThere are reasons to believe that the Gulf Cartel is behind the protests,\u201d the governor told reporters on Tuesday.\nGeneral Edgar Luis Villegas Mel\u00e9ndez, commander of the Eighth Military zone in Reynosa, said the protesters who had demonstrated in front of his base had been seen receiving cash from organizers. \u201cThey\u2019re paid by the criminals,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\nSome Mexican newspapers have labeled the demonstrations \u201cnarco-protests.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a hypothesis you have to consider,\u201d said Jorge Chabat, a security expert at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City. \u201cSomeone is organizing these protests. They don\u2019t seem spontaneous. Whoever the organizer happens to be is not showing their face.\u201d A trafficker in Monterrey who was arrested last week initially acknowledged that he had helped organize the protests, the army said.\nWhoever is behind the demonstrations is tapping into widespread public discontent with the way Mr. Calder\u00f3n\u2019s government is waging its antidrug war.\nAt a protest on Tuesday in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Brenda Contreras said that her husband had been detained by soldiers three months ago during a raid and not been heard from since. \u201cWhere he is, only the army knows,\u201d she told The Associated Press.\nSince Mr. Calder\u00f3n\u2019s army patrols began in December 2006, human rights complaints against soldiers have spiked significantly. And the army has paid compensation to a number of families for killing or wounding innocent civilians. The government contends that most people back the crackdown on drug trafficking, and it says there are signs of progress.\nThe government says the army\u2019s role is temporary, until police forces are better trained. \u201cI do not believe it\u2019s the best way,\u201d Jorge Tello Pe\u00f3n, an adviser to Mr. Calderon, said at a recent forum. \u201cThe military is not a law enforcement agency. But it\u2019s important to get their support in order to develop the abilities of law enforcement agencies.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/world/americas/19mexico.html", "title": "Drug Tie Seen to Protests in Mexico", "author": "MARC LACEY"}

A spokeswoman, Elizabeth Mathias, said the strike hit a vehicle \u201cin the middle of nowhere, away from civilians and homes.\u201d She said the military has a video showing the strike hitting the militants away from populated areas, but the military will not release it because its source cannot be revealed.\nMr. Munib said an investigation was continuing.\nCivilian deaths have become a political flash point in Afghanistan, undermining public support for the war and inflaming tensions with President Hamid Karzai, who has condemned the American-led coalition for the rising toll.\nAccording to the United Nations, the number of civilian casualties caused last year by the Taliban and other insurgents was several thousand, compared with 828 civilian deaths attributed to American, NATO and Afghan forces, mostly from airstrikes and village raids.\nTuesday\u2019s attack came as Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior American commander for Iraq and Afghanistan, said this week that violence here had reached a new high and warned of increasing difficulties.\nLast week, there were about 400 insurgent attacks compared with about 50 per week in 2004. Tensions have been especially acute recently after an American military investigation concluded that its personnel made significant errors in carrying out airstrikes in western Afghanistan in early May that killed dozens of Afghan civilians in Farah Province.\nThe Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission said that operation killed up to 97 civilians, most of them children, while the Afghan government\u2019s figure was 140.

{"date": "Thu, 12 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LUCCA, Italy \u2014 With its pink-hued medieval churches, tree-lined city walls and a famously excellent regional cuisine, Lucca seems the perfect Tuscan city. But that charm is precisely what has made it the latest battleground in a tug of war between the romantic Italy of the popular imagination and the more complex reality.\nLucca\u2019s center-right city council recently stirred much contention, and accusations of racism, by prohibiting new ethnic food restaurants from opening within its gorgeous historical center.\nThis is, after all, a walled city. Many shops have been in the same families for generations. Some locals proudly trace their lineage, or imagined lineage, back to the Etruscans, who founded Lucca before the Romans took over about 180 B.C. With so much history, change comes hard.\nLucca is \u201cvery closed,\u201d said Rogda Gok, a native of Turkey and the co-owner of Mesopotamia, a kebab restaurant, in the heart of the historical center. \u201cIn Istanbul there\u2019s other food, like German and Italian, it\u2019s no problem,\u201d she added. \u201cBut here in Lucca, they only want Luccan food.\u201d\nIn this deeply conservative city, where even Sicilian food is considered ethnic, there are already four kebab houses, testaments to Italy\u2019s growing immigrant population and the fact that many Italians, especially young ones, like eating non-Italian food. Offering kebabs at $5, the restaurants are also a bargain in difficult times.\nUnder the new law, these four can stay, but the banning of new ethnic and fast-food restaurants within the city walls has struck many here as contrary to the rules of free-market capitalism and the notion that Italy can offer more than visions of its long-dead past.\nYet those dreamy visions of Tuscany \u2014 rolling hills, olive groves, the bicycle paths on Lucca\u2019s tree-lined Renaissance-era city walls \u2014 are exactly what draw the half-million tourists a year that the city relies on to survive. Lucca is not the only city caught in this struggle. Siena and other Tuscan cities have also banned fast food in their historical centers.\nThis month, Venice dropped a controversial plan to allow Coca-Cola to place vending machines throughout the city, one of many corporate sponsorships that help support its infrastructure from the crushing weight of the tourism that today is its lifeblood.\nIn Lucca, the kebab ban has also struck a chord. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful,\u201d said Renata Barbonchielli, a Lucca resident, as she stood outside a bakery downtown. \u201cOf course there should be kebabs. We have to have openness here.\u201d\nYet, in a perhaps hopeful example of how the ideals of an enlightened minority outstrip actual experience, Ms. Barbonchielli acknowledged that she was unfamiliar with kebabs.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never tried one,\u201d she said, \u201cbut my kids like them.\u201d\nLucca allowed the kebab shops to open in the first place only because city officials did not know what they were, Filippo Candelise, a Lucca City Council member who handles economic development, said in a recent interview in the medieval palazzo that houses city government.\nMr. Candelise defended the new regulation as essential for Lucca\u2019s future. \u201cWe absolutely reject the \u2018racist\u2019 label,\u201d he said. \u201cWe simply want to preserve our cultural and historical identity.\u201d\nIndeed, visitors from countries that pride themselves on openness do not necessarily bring the same perspective to Lucca. \u201cAn American wants to find a typical \u2018osteria,\u2019 not a Chinese restaurant,\u201d Mr. Candelise said.\nBarbara Di Cesare, a spokeswoman for the city, showed e-mail messages from around the world, lauding the new norm. \u201cYou are right to keep Lucca\u2019s charm,\u201d one German tourist wrote. \u201cWe come to Lucca every year because we want to see and live Italy, not New York.\u201d\nThe ban applies only to new businesses within the walls of Lucca\u2019s historical center, with its 8,000 inhabitants, and not the greater Lucca area, with its 86,000 residents and many fast-food restaurants.\nAll the fuss has been good for business, said Mohammad Riaz, the Pakistani owner of Doner Kebab Casalgrande in downtown Lucca. The shop is particularly popular with students. As he ordered a kebab, Alessandro Tucci, 22, said he opposed the ban. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should have the freedom to cook what they want.\u201d\nSome of Italy\u2019s most well respected food critics agree. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy today to put limits on kebabs, hamburgers, hot dogs,\u201d said Davide Paolini, the food critic for Il Sole 24 Ore and author of the Gastronauta blog, which explores Italian regional cuisine. \u201cBy now these aren\u2019t connected to any particular area. They belong to the world.\u201d\nThe only city in Tuscany with a traditionally right-wing government, Lucca has a long and fierce tradition of self-preservation. When Italy was unified in the 1860s, Luccans pooled their resources and bought the walled city from the nascent Italian state, which had wanted to tear it down.\n\u201cLuccans are very conservative,\u201d said Franco Barbieri, a co-owner of La Buca di Sant\u2019Antonio, one of the city\u2019s most celebrated restaurants, whose specialties include feather light ravioli with ricotta and zucchini, pappardelle in wild game sauce and a semi-sweet chestnut flour cake.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019re Etruscans, not Romans,\u201d he added.\nStanding behind the wooden counter of the upscale bakery that has been in his family for five generations and specializes in \u201cbuccellato,\u201d a round anise-flavored bread, Marino Tadeucci, 24, said he agreed with the ban \u201cto a certain extent.\u201d\nBut he found it strange that the city would ban fast food yet allow shops selling underwear and plastic knickknacks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay an oasis,\u201d said Roberto Isola, the owner of the Delicatezze gourmet food shop, as he stood behind a mouth-watering array of meats, cheeses, fresh-churned butter and truffle-flavored lard.\nThe ban on ethnic and fast food will not do much good, he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/world/europe/13lucca.html", "title": "A Walled City in Tuscany Clings to Its Ancient Menu", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}
{"date": "Wed, 04 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "LONDON \u2014 A British court said Wednesday that it was unable to release information about a British terrorism suspect who says he was tortured in American custody, because of what the court called a threat from the United States to reconsider sharing intelligence with the country.\nThe court expressed dismay that a democracy \u201cgoverned by the rule of law\u201d would seek to suppress evidence \u201crelevant to allegations of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, politically embarrassing though it might be.\u201d\nThe case has been a source of considerable diplomatic tension between the United States and Britain.\nAt issue in Wednesday\u2019s ruling were seven paragraphs that the court had redacted in an earlier opinion in the case, and that it suggested lent credence to the torture allegations by the suspect, Binyam Mohamed, who is now in prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. Mr. Mohamed is an Ethiopian who had become a legal resident of Britain.\nThe court said the paragraphs summarize reports by the United States to Britain\u2019s intelligence services about the treatment of Mr. Mohamed. It said it had removed the text at the request of the British Foreign Office, which was responding to a \u201cthreat\u201d from the Bush administration.\nThe court said the Bush administration had made the threat in a letter to the Foreign Office last September. It called on the Obama administration to reverse that position.\nBritain\u2019s foreign secretary, David Miliband, said Wednesday that it was inaccurate to describe the American position as a threat. Mr. Miliband said on Channel 4 News here that the very nature of intelligence sharing required that \u201csecrets should remain secrets.\u201d\nHe added that the British government had made \u201cstrenuous efforts\u201d to have Mr. Mohamed released.\nIn a statement, the State Department said that the United States \u201cthanks the U.K. government for its continued commitment to protect sensitive national security information\u201d and that \u201cthe United States investigates allegations and claims of torture, and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment such as those raised by Binyam Mohamed.\u201d\nAfter being seized by American and British intelligence officials in Pakistan in 2002, Mr. Mohamed was taken to Morocco, where he was held for 18 months, according to earlier court rulings and American and British officials. The court said the summary was \u201chighly material\u201d to Mr. Mohamed\u2019s allegations \u201cthat he had been subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.\u201d\nActing on a request from the court last November, several news media organizations, including The New York Times, had asked the court to restore the redacted paragraphs.\nThe two-judge panel left no doubt that it thought the paragraphs should be in the public domain. There was nothing in them that would expose any intelligence agents, the court said.\nBut the judges said they had no legal authority to overrule the Foreign Office, which they said took seriously the \u201cgravity of threat\u201d by the United States to cut off intelligence sharing.\nMr. Mohamed, who had lived in the United States for several years as a teenager, went to Afghanistan in 2001.

{"date": "Thu, 12 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BANGKOK \u2014 In one of his most provocative moves since being ousted in a coup three years ago, Thailand\u2019s fugitive former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, is visiting neighboring Cambodia this week, stirring tensions between the nations and invigorating his political supporters at home.\nSpeaking in Cambodia\u2019s capital, Phnom Penh, on Thursday, he accused the Thai government of \u201cfalse patriotism\u201d in long-running frictions that include an armed standoff at a disputed 11th-century temple on the nations\u2019 common border.\nBut the provocation was not his words so much as his presence and his warm welcome in Cambodia, the closest he has come to his homeland as he has circled the world, from Hong Kong to London to Nicaragua to Montenegro and now to a refuge in Dubai. While he insists he wants to go home, Mr. Thaksin has been on the run as the Thai government seeks his extradition on a conviction for corruption while he was in office.\nIn Phnom Penh, he will be looking over the shoulders of regional heads of state, including those of Cambodia and Thailand, as they gather Friday in Singapore, just a short flight away, for a summit meeting.\n\u201cThaksin is up to no good,\u201d said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, an expert on Thailand at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. \u201cI would say Thaksin is on a new offensive.\n\u201cI think both of them, their moves, have been perfectly calculated,\u201d he added. He was referring to Mr. Thaksin and to his host, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, who appeared to be using the visit to tweak his counterparts across the border.\nOn Wednesday, Cambodia rejected Thailand\u2019s demand for Mr. Thaksin\u2019s extradition.\nMr. Pavin said that if Mr. Thaksin could show the public that the Thai government \u201cis incapable and unable to solve this crisis, then this will be a slap in the face of the government and will raise questions about the legitimacy of the government.\u201d\nMr. Thaksin\u2019s visit has escalated a confrontation between the nations that began with a dispute in 2008 over sovereignty at the Preah Vihear temple, where the two armies have fought several bloody skirmishes and remain on alert.\nThe two nations recalled their ambassadors last week after Mr. Hun Sen announced the appointment of Mr. Thaksin as an \u201ceconomic adviser,\u201d and Thailand said it would scrap an agreement governing negotiations over disputed offshore oil and gas deposits.\nIn its diplomatic note rejecting the demand for Mr. Thaksin\u2019s extradition on Wednesday, the Cambodian government noted, in capital letters, that he had been forced from office although he had been \u201cOVERWHELMINGLY and DEMOCRATICALLY elected by the Thai people.\u201d\nOn Thursday both nations expelled an additional diplomat in a tit-for-tat escalation of the diplomatic row.\nMr. Hun Sen may be looking to his own long-term interests and placing a bet on Mr. Thaksin as the future leader of Thailand, Mr. Pavin said.\nIn Thailand, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and his Democrat Party remain politically weak, and many analysts say that supporters of Mr. Thaksin would be likely to win any new election.\nMr. Hun Sen, who greeted Mr. Thaksin on Monday with an embrace and a vow of \u201ceternal friendship,\u201d seemed to taunt Mr. Abhisit, who took office in a parliamentary vote last December, with the backing of the military and without a popular vote. He was an indirect beneficiary of the coup that ousted Mr. Thaksin.\n\u201cIf Abhisit is so capable, why not dissolve the Parliament and call for a new election?\u201d Mr. Hun Sen asked Wednesday. \u201cWhat is he afraid of? I am the prime minister of Cambodia who received two-thirds of the vote, and how many votes did Abhisit receive? Or did he steal his seat from other people?\u201d\nMr. Hun Sen, 58, and Mr. Abhisit, 45, come from different worlds, the former raised as a barefoot temple boy who took up arms for the Khmer Rouge, the latter an Eton and Oxford man, fluent in English and in Western ways.\nIf Mr. Thaksin\u2019s intention was to discomfit the Thai government and keep himself on the front pages of newspapers at home, he seems to have succeeded.\n\u201cRejected!\u201d read a banner headline, in red type, in The Nation, a daily newspaper, on Thursday, referring to Cambodia\u2019s refusal to extradite Mr. Thaksin.\nFilling most of the front page under the headline was a facsimile of Cambodia\u2019s diplomatic note, with its capitalized reference to the \u201cABSOLUTE REALITIES\u201d of Thai politics and an implication of Mr. Thaksin\u2019s legitimacy as prime minister.\nThe newspaper also printed Mr. Thaksin\u2019s schedule in Cambodia for the next few days: a visit to the ancient temples at Angkor, a round of golf with Mr. Hun Sen and possibly a meeting with supporters bused in from Thailand.\nAfter that, renewing the mystery that Mr. Thaksin has cultivated, the schedule simply noted, \u201cDepart Cambodia for an unknown destination.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/world/asia/13cambo.html", "title": "Cambodia\u2019s Embrace of Thaksin Stirs Tensions", "author": "SETH MYDANS"}
{"date": "Thu, 10 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela thrust himself into one of the most contentious disputes between Russia and the West on Thursday, announcing that his country would become the third to recognize the independence declared by two Russian-backed rebel regions of Georgia.\nRussia recognized the two republics, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as independent a year ago, shortly after it fought a war against Georgia over the territories. Until Thursday, only Nicaragua had followed suit.\n\u201cVenezuela is joining in recognition of the independence of the republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,\u201d Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said during a meeting with Russia\u2019s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, at his residence outside Moscow. \u201cStarting today, we will recognize these republics,\u201d he said, through a Russian translator.\nThe announcement drew an immediate response from Abkhazia\u2019s de facto president, Sergei Bagapsh, who thanked Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and pledged closer economic and political ties with Venezuela, Interfax reported.\nMr. Medvedev also offered his thanks. \u201cWe are not indifferent to the fate of South Ossetia and Abkhazia; we were the first country to come to the rescue of these young regions,\u201d he said, in remarks on Russian television. \u201cWe are glad that worldwide support for them is growing.\u201d\nMoscow\u2019s decision to recognize the two regions and deploy hundreds of Russian troops in both after its brief war with Georgia last August drew widespread international condemnation. It also raised tensions with some other countries in the former Soviet sphere, who worried that the precedent could encourage separatist movements within their own borders.\nThe issue has also ensured that tensions remain high between Russia and Georgia. Lately, the two have clashed over shipping rights to Abkhazia via the Black Sea. The Georgian coast guard has impounded five ships from different countries this year for delivering supplies to Abkhazia in violation of Georgian law.\nGeorgia brushed aside Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s announcement on Thursday as insignificant.\n\u201cIt does not change the situation concerning these regions at all,\u201d said Alexander Nalbandov, Georgia\u2019s deputy foreign minister. \u201cNinety-nine percent of the international community recognizes the territorial integrity of Georgia.\u201d\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez arrived in Moscow on Wednesday and, in usual form, delivered a speech at a local university railing against the United States. The Kremlin has typically tried to distance itself from Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s often flamboyant jingoism, but Russia has become one of Venezuela\u2019s key international partners.\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez sees Moscow as possibly acting as a counterweight to Washington\u2019s influence in Latin America. He has visited Russia eight times as president, often seeking to procure Russian-made arms and weapons systems. Russia and Venezuela in recent years have signed agreements worth over $4 billion for deliveries of fighter jets, helicopters and automatic weapons. In a visit last year, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez signed an agreement for a $1 billion loan from Russia for weapons purchases and military development.\nRussia was third last year in global weapons sales, recording $3.5 billion, just behind Italy, with $3.7 billion, according to a recently released Congressional study. The United States sells the most by far, with agreements valued at $37.8 billion in 2008, the study said. The study noted that China and India continue to be Russia\u2019s main weapons clients, but that Russia has a new focus on arms sales to Latin American nations, particularly Venezuela.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Medvedev reiterated Russia\u2019s commitment to supply Venezuela with an array of new weapons, adding that such sales would adhere to international law.\n\u201cWe will supply Venezuela with all the weapons that they request,\u201d Mr. Medvedev said. \u201cWe will supply tanks among the deliveries. Why not? We have good tanks.

{"date": "Mon, 15 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "As the embattled government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appears to be trying to limit Internet access and communications in Iran, new kinds of social media are challenging those traditional levers of state media control and allowing Iranians to find novel ways around the restrictions.\nIranians are blogging, posting to Facebook and, most visibly, coordinating their protests on Twitter, the messaging service. Their activity has increased, not decreased, since the presidential election on Friday and ensuing attempts by the government to restrict or censor their online communications.\nOn Twitter, reports and links to photos from a peaceful mass march through Tehran on Monday, along with accounts of street fighting and casualties around the country, have become the most popular topic on the service worldwide, according to Twitter\u2019s published statistics.\nA couple of Twitter feeds have become virtual media offices for the supporters of the leading opposition candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi. One feed, mousavi1388 (1388 is the year in the Persian calendar), is filled with news of protests and exhortations to keep up the fight, in Persian and in English. It has more than 7,000 followers.\nMr. Moussavi\u2019s fan group on Facebook has swelled to over 50,000 members, a significant increase since election day.\nLabeling such seemingly spontaneous antigovernment demonstrations a \u201cTwitter Revolution\u201d has already become something of a clich\u00e9. That title had been given to the protests in Moldova in April.\nBut Twitter is aware of the power of its service. Acknowledging its role on the global stage, the San Francisco-based company said Monday that it was delaying a planned shutdown for maintenance for a day, citing \u201cthe role Twitter is currently playing as an important communication tool in Iran.\u201d\nTwitter users are posting messages, known as tweets, with the term #IranElection, which allows users to search for all tweets on the subject. On Monday evening, Twitter was registering about 30 new posts a minute with that tag.\nOne read, \u201cWe have no national press coverage in Iran, everyone should help spread Moussavi\u2019s message. One Person = One Broadcaster. #IranElection.\u201d\nThe Twitter feed StopAhmadi calls itself the \u201cDedicated Twitter account for Moussavi supporters\u201d and has more than 6,000 followers. It links to a page on the photo-hosting site Flickr that includes dozens of pictures from the rally on Monday in Tehran.\nThe feed Persiankiwi, which has more than 15,000 followers, sends users to a page in Persian that is hosted by Google and, in its only English text, says, \u201cDue to widespread filters in Iran, please view this site to receive the latest news, letters and communications from Mir Hussein Moussavi.\u201d\nSome Twitter users were also going on the offensive. On Monday morning, an antigovernment activist using the Twitter account \u201cDDOSIran\u201d asked supporters to visit a Web site to participate in an online attack to try to crash government Web sites by overwhelming them with traffic.\nBy Monday afternoon, many of those sites were not accessible, though it was not clear if the attack was responsible \u2014 and the Twitter account behind the attack had been removed. A Twitter spokeswoman said the company had no connection to the deletion of the account.\nThe crackdown on communications began on election day, when text-messaging services were shut down in what opposition supporters said was an attempt to block one of their most important organizing tools. Over the weekend, cellphone transmissions and access to Facebook and some other Web sites were also blocked.\nIranians continued to report on Monday that they could not send text messages.\nBut it appears they are finding ways around Big Brother.\nMany Twitter users have been sharing ways to evade government snooping, such as programming their Web browsers to contact a proxy \u2014 or an Internet server that relays their connection through another country.\nAustin Heap, a 25-year-old information technology consultant in San Francisco, is running his own private proxies to help Iranians, and is advertising them on Twitter. He said on Monday that his servers were providing the Internet connections for about 750 Iranians at any one moment.\n\u201cI think that cyber activism can be a way to empower people living under less than democratic governments around the world,\u201d he said.\nGlobal Internet Freedom Consortium, an Internet proxy service with ties to the banned Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, offers downloadable software to help evade censorship. It said its traffic from Iran had tripled in the last week.\nShiyu Zhou, founder of the organization, has no idea how links to the software spread within Iran. \u201cIn China we have sent mass e-mails, but nothing like in Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Iranian people actually found out by themselves and have passed this on by word of mouth.\u201d\nJonathan Zittrain, a professor at Harvard Law School who is an expert on the Internet, said that Twitter was particularly resilient to censorship because it had so many ways for its posts to originate \u2014 from a phone, a Web browser or specialized applications \u2014 and so many outlets for those posts to appear.\nAs each new home for this material becomes a new target for censorship, he said, a repressive system faces a game of whack-a-mole in blocking Internet address after Internet address carrying the subversive material.\n\u201cIt is easy for Twitter feeds to be echoed everywhere else in the world,\u201d Mr. Zittrain said. \u201cThe qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what make it so powerful.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/16/world/middleeast/16media.html", "title": "Social Networks Spread Defiance Online", "author": "BRAD STONE and NOAM COHEN"}
{"date": "Tue, 24 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CUBAGUA, Venezuela \u2014 The first living things to greet a visitor on this desert island are the dogs. More than a dozen roam through the ruins of Nueva C\u00e1diz, as if signaling that the city that flourished here five centuries ago at the start of the European conquest belongs to them now.\nAmid their howling, a weathered sign next to a garbage pile briefly describes the rise and fall of Nueva C\u00e1diz, by 1515 a slaving center and the flash point for Latin America\u2019s first frenzied commodities boom, built around pearls. By 1541, the sign says, \u201cThe depleted oyster beds put a final end to the city.\u201d\nSo it went for Cubagua. Before the conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s plundered the riches of Mexico\u2019s Aztec empire, Spain established a thriving outpost here on one of the Lesser Antilles\u2019s most desolate islands, which is so dry that water supplies have to be imported from the mainland and nearby islands (as they were for Nueva C\u00e1diz).\nSpanish officials sent the enslaved here and killed off Caribbean ethnic groups, like the Lucayans brought from the Bahamas as pearl divers. The Spanish laid out avenues and built an imposing city of limestone that was intended to serve as a base for conquering the rest of South America. Then, suddenly, they abandoned it.\nNueva C\u00e1diz is now largely forgotten, even in Venezuela. Scholars occasionally drop by for a glimpse into the dawn of the Spanish conquest, and archaeologists sometimes obtain permits to dig here. Otherwise Cubagua\u2019s ruins, which might rank among the most important post-Columbian archaeological sites in the Americas, are a lost city \u2014 in effect, if not in name.\n\u201cTo this day I do not understand why anyone would build a city here,\u201d said Enrique Su\u00e1rez, 60, a fisherman who lives in a house built of driftwood and discarded tin on the edge of the ruins.\nLeft vulnerable to the elements and mainland looters, the city\u2019s walls now stand no more than a few feet high. A concrete historical marker erected in the early 1990s lies ravaged by vandals.\nCubagua\u2019s entire population today numbers fewer than 100, all of them fishermen like Mr. Su\u00e1rez and their families. They live on what they catch, in Mr. Su\u00e1rez\u2019s case on a recent morning a stingray that he was drying in the scorching sun. Later, he said he would prepare the stingray with some salt and garlic.\nFor diversion, he raises fighting cocks and feeds some of the feral dogs. Apart from his small boat, his only mainland tie seemed to be a red flag on his roof emblazoned with the letters P.S.U.V. \u2014 the initials of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Socialist party and a symbol of a revolution that has not yet arrived in Cubagua.\n\u201cWe are living in almost complete solitude out here,\u201d Mr. Su\u00e1rez said, \u201cand that is the way we like it.\u201d\nArchaeologists occasionally disrupt this idyll. Last year, a team led by a Venezuelan, Jorge Armand, disembarked here and found shrubs and garbage covering the ruins. The fishermen were using the ruins of Nueva C\u00e1diz as an open air outhouse, Mr. Armand said.\n\u201cHere was a city built by the Spanish to last five centuries, and today it is hardly even on the margins of our consciousness,\u201d Mr. Armand said. \u201cParadoxically, thanks to this neglect, the ruins have been more or less preserved.\u201d\nBefore Mr. Ch\u00e1vez rose to power a decade ago, developers planned to build one of the Caribbean\u2019s largest resort complexes on Cubagua, with 8,000 hotel rooms, two aquariums, a highway system, two 18-hole golf courses and a desalination plant to provide fresh water. But opposition from environmentalists and historians scuttled the project.\nAbout two years ago, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s government unveiled its own plan to develop Cubagua, roughly a 10-square-mile outcrop. It called for a small port, a museum, a school and a health clinic, and for the fishermen to be trained so they could go to work in tourism cooperatives.\nBut money for the project vanished from the Institute of Cultural Patrimony, according to published reports in Caracas. Mr. Armand called in January for a federal investigation into claims of corruption surrounding the project.\nThe wait for justice in Venezuela can take years, decades, perhaps longer. Meanwhile, Cubagua still beckons to the occasional wayfarer, like Peter Muilenburg, who wrote an account in the 1990s of the island\u2019s place in Caribbean history, describing its \u201canarchy, greed, and wealth.\u201d\nStephen G. Bloom, an American who is publishing a history of pearls this year titled \u201cTears of Mermaids,\u201d traveled to Cubagua in 2008.\n\u201cThere were a bunch of wild dogs guarding something of amazingly valuable historical importance,\u201d said Mr. Bloom. \u201cI found it immensely sad.\u201d\nArchaeologists and economic historians also see a parable for today\u2019s oil-rich Venezuela. Nueva C\u00e1diz exploded as a New World epicenter for commodity exploitation, and fell just as quickly when the population of oysters in its hammerhead-infested waters crashed after just a few decades.\n\u201cWill other areas of Venezuela resemble Cubagua when the oil industry disappears?\u201d asked Mr. Armand, the archaeologist.\nSkeptics counter that it is far too early to even pose such a question. Venezuela, after all, boasts some of the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East.\nBut even that bounty may not shield complex oil projects from obsolescence someday. Competition from new energy technologies moves forward. Abrupt shifts in the global economy whipsaw different industries. As a former Saudi oil minister once put it, the Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones.\nThe pearl industry\u2019s evolution points to one possible outcome. Even today, Cubagua\u2019s fishermen still find tiny pearls in oysters. But even if these pearls resemble the gems once lusted after by European royalty, they are nearly worthless compared with the gumball-size pearls now cultivated in Asia.\n\u201cThe oyster\u2019s meat is now worth more than its pearl,\u201d said Cornelio Marcano, 37, a fisherman who lives on Cubagua. \u201cAfter all, what is more important?\u201d he asked. \u201cFood for one\u2019s belly or a pearl?\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/world/americas/25venez.html", "title": "In Venezuela, Trying to Map Out Blueprint for Lost City", "author": "SIMON ROMERO"}

{"date": "Wed, 03 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Senior Israeli officials accused President Obama on Wednesday of failing to acknowledge what they called clear understandings with the Bush administration that allowed Israel to build West Bank settlement housing within certain guidelines while still publicly claiming to honor a settlement \u201cfreeze.\u201d\nThe complaint was the latest in a growing rift between the Obama administration and the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over how to move forward to achieve peace in the Middle East. Mr. Obama was in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and is scheduled to address the Muslim world from Cairo on Thursday.\nThe Israeli officials said that repeated discussions with Bush officials starting in late 2002 resulted in agreement that housing could be built within the boundaries of certain settlement blocks as long as no new land was expropriated, no special economic incentives were offered to move to settlements and no new settlements were built.\nThe officials spoke on the condition of anonymity so that they could discuss an issue of such controversy between the two governments.\nWhen Israel signed on to the so-called road map for a two-state solution in 2003, with a provision that says its government \u201cfreezes all settlement activity (including natural growth of settlements),\u201d the officials said, it did so after a detailed discussion with Bush administration officials that laid out those explicit exceptions.\n\u201cNot everything is written down,\u201d one of the officials said.\nHe and others said that Israel agreed to the road map and to move ahead with the removal of settlements and soldiers from Gaza in 2005 on the understanding that settlement growth could continue.\nBut a former senior official in the Bush administration disagreed, calling the Israeli characterization \u201can overstatement.\u201d\n\u201cThere was never an agreement to accept natural growth,\u201d the official said Tuesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. \u201cThere was an effort to explore what natural growth would mean, but we weren\u2019t able to reach agreement on that.\u201d\nThe former official said that Bush administration officials had been working with their Israeli counterparts to clarify several issues, including natural growth, government subsidies to settlers, and the cessation of appropriation of Palestinian land.\nThe United States and Israel never reached an agreement, though, either public or private, the official said.\nA second senior Bush administration official, also speaking anonymously, said Wednesday: \u201cWe talked about a settlement freeze with four elements. One was no new settlements, a second was no new confiscation of Palestinian land, one was no new subsidies and finally, no construction outside the settlements.\u201d\nHe described that fourth condition, which applied to natural growth, as similar to taking a string and tying it around a settlement, and prohibiting any construction outside that string.\nBut, he added, \u201cWe had a tentative agreement, but that was contingent on drawing up lines, and this is a process that never got done, therefore the settlement freeze was never formalized and never done.\u201d\nA third former Bush administration official, Elliott Abrams, who was on the National Security Council staff, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post in April that seemed to endorse the Israeli argument.\nThe Israeli officials acknowledged that the new American administration had different ideas about the meaning of the term \u201csettlement freeze.\u201d Mr. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have said in the past week that the term means an end to all building, including natural growth.\nBut the Israeli officials complained that Mr. Obama had not accepted that the previous understandings existed. Instead, they lamented, Israel now stood accused of having cheated and dissembled in its settlement activity whereas, in fact, it had largely lived within the guidelines to which both governments had agreed.\nOn Monday, Mr. Netanyahu said Israel \u201ccannot freeze life in the settlements,\u201d calling the American demand \u201cunreasonable.\u201d\nDov Weissglas, who was a senior aide to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, wrote an opinion article that appeared Tuesday in Yediot Aharonot, a mass-selling newspaper, laying out the agreements that he said had been reached with officials in the Bush administration.\nHe said that in May 2003 he and Mr. Sharon met with Mr. Abrams and Stephen J. Hadley of the National Security Council and came up with the definition of settlement freeze: \u201cno new communities were to be built; no Palestinian lands were to be appropriated for settlement purposes; building will not take place beyond the existing community outline; and no \u2018settlement encouraging\u2019 budgets were to be allocated.\u201d\nHe said that Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser at the time, signed off on that definition later that month and that the two governments also agreed to set up a joint committee to define more fully the meaning of \u201cexisting community outline\u201d for established settlements.\nIn April 2004, President Bush presented Mr. Sharon with a letter stating, \u201cIn light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949.\u201d\nThat letter, Mr. Weissglas said, was a result of his earlier negotiations with Bush administration officials acknowledging that certain settlement blocks would remain Israeli and open to continued growth.\nThe Israeli officials said that no Bush administration official had ever publicly insisted that Israel was obliged to stop all building in the areas it captured in 1967. They said it was important to know that major oral understandings reached between an Israeli prime minister and an American president would not simply be tossed aside when a new administration came into the White House.\nOf course, Mr. Netanyahu has yet to endorse the two-state solution or even the road map agreed to by previous Israeli governments, which were not oral commitments, but actual signed and public agreements.\nIn his opinion article in The Washington Post, Mr. Abrams, the former Bush official who was part of negotiations with Israel, wrote: \u201cFor the past five years, Israel\u2019s government has largely adhered to guidelines that were discussed with the United States but never formally adopted: that there would be no new settlements, no financial incentives for Israelis to move to settlements and no new construction except in already built-up areas. The clear purpose of the guidelines?

{"date": "Sat, 21 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "VLADIVOSTOK, Russia \u2014 Vasily Reutov had never set foot in Russia until a few months ago, but the moment he did, he knew he had finally made it home.\nHis ancestors, members of an ascetic offshoot of Russian Orthodoxy known as Old Believers, fled this region in the 1920s after the Communist Party violently suppressed religion. They settled in cloistered villages in South America that they turned into Little Russias, as if by preserving the ways of the past, they would somehow, someday, be able to return.\nNow, with Russia itself beckoning and sturdier than before, that time has come.\nThe government is trying to head off the country\u2019s severe population decline by luring back Russians who live abroad as well as their descendants. Mr. Reutov and several dozen other members of his religious community from Uruguay have become among the most striking examples of this policy.\nMoscow has spent $300 million in the past two years to get the repatriation program started, and officials estimated that more than 25 million people were eligible, many of them ethnic Russians who found themselves living in former Soviet republics after the Soviet collapse in 1991.\nBut the government is not limiting itself to Russia\u2019s neighbors, sending emissaries around the world to sell the program. One even went to Brazil last month to meet with residents of several countries who, like Mr. Reutov, are Old Believers, whose followers have some similarities in lifestyle to the Amish. Diaspora Old Believer communities exist worldwide, including in Alaska and Oregon.\nMr. Reutov, 36, was not at the meeting in Brazil because he was already here, having decided to enroll in the program and move with his wife and five children from Uruguay. Others from two villages there are to follow soon, he said.\nTheir story is one of the last unfinished chapters of the Russian Revolution, and it speaks to the changes in Russia in the post-Soviet era. Even with the global financial crisis, Russia is more stable and prosperous than at any other time in its history, and Mr. Reutov said that only now was his community confident enough in the country\u2019s future.\nAnd so they are ready to uproot themselves and begin anew, back where it all began \u2014 in this windswept coastal area in Russia\u2019s Far East.\n\u201cWe have always felt like we belonged to Russia,\u201d Mr. Reutov said. \u201cWe are Russian, and we need to be here.\u201d\nYet their return also points to Russia\u2019s disquieting population drop. The United Nations predicts that the country will fall to 116 million people by 2050, from 141 million now, an 18 percent decline, largely because of a low birthrate and poor health habits. (The government is trying to increase the birthrate by paying families to have more children.)\nSo far, only 10,300 people have moved back under the government repatriation program, which has faced criticism that it is overly bureaucratic and unpersuasive. But Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the program needed time to generate interest, and officials said they hoped that many more would soon take advantage of relocation and employment assistance, which can amount to several thousand dollars a person.\nIt is unclear how the financial crisis will affect the program\u2019s appeal. While Russia has been hit hard, many of its neighbors are faring even worse, so people might choose to try their luck here. On the other hand, some might be deterred because they cannot find jobs in Russia, particularly in its hard-hit Far East.\nVladimir G. Pozdorovkin, a Foreign Ministry official who oversees the program, has visited several countries in the past year to promote it, including Germany and Egypt. At the meeting in Brazil last month, he said, he was peppered with questions from Old Believers about the quality of life and the business climate in Russia.\n\u201cTheir desire to return to the historic homeland is there,\u201d Mr. Pozdorovkin said. \u201cTheir fathers and grandfathers always told them that they had to return to Russia. But to what Russia, what conditions are there \u2014 they want to find that out beforehand.\u201d\nAfter several weeks roaming the Vladivostok region, Mr. Reutov said he was convinced. He and his brother-in-law, Aleksei Kilin, 26, have been looking for a relatively isolated area where they can set up a farm.\nThey located distant relatives and went to the villages of their forebears, who escaped in the 1920s to Harbin, a major city in China\u2019s northeast that was a center for Russian refugees, before ending up in South America.\nMr. Reutov said he was pleased with the help that he had received from regional officials, who seem equally pleased that he is returning. Russia\u2019s vast and sparsely inhabited Far East has fallen in population to six million, from eight million in 1991. Tens of millions of Chinese are just over the border, but Russia does not want to allow them in.\nThe program is not open to just any descendants of Russians. In general, applicants must speak Russian and be comfortable with the country\u2019s society and culture.\nMr. Reutov and Mr. Kilin were thus ideal. Russian is their first language \u2014 Mr. Kilin said he barely spoke Spanish \u2014 and they easily blended in here. Only their beards and homemade white dress shirts, both characteristic of Old Believers, attracted attention.\nStill, not all Old Believer communities are as enthusiastic. The Rev. Nikolai Yakunin, a priest who leads one in Nikolaevsk, Alaska, said he was often asked whether he yearned to live in Russia.\n\u201cWe are not moving back,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are still Communists there, even if they call themselves democrats.\u201d Yet, Father Yakunin conceded he was worried that young people in his community were quickly assimilating, failing to learn Russian and losing cultural ties.\nMr. Reutov had lived in the United States for a time before deciding to return to South America, in part because he, too, was concerned about his children.\n\u201cIt is really hard to keep up the traditions,\u201d Mr. Reutov said. \u201cThe young people in the communities in the United States don\u2019t speak Russian at all. And for us, that is not acceptable.\u201d\nHe said some people in their villages in Uruguay and Brazil considered returning to Russia in the 1980s and 1990s but concluded that the country was too volatile. Now, he and his brother-in-law are reporting more positive impressions to family and friends in South America.\n\u201cThey are all now calling me and asking me how it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are saying, \u2018If you can find a place for us, we are ready to move.\u2019 \u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/world/europe/22believers.html", "title": "Its Population Falling, Russia Beckons Its Children Home", "author": "CLIFFORD J.

It said he had planned to crash an airplane into Singapore\u2019s airport and had coordinated a failed plot to bomb the United States Embassy and several other targets in Singapore. He was being detained under Singapore\u2019s Internal Security Act, which allows the government to hold suspects indefinitely without a trial.\n\u201cHow he got from the detention center to Malaysia without anybody seeing him is extraordinary, after the biggest and most expensive manhunt ever undertaken by Singapore,\u201d said Sidney Jones, a leading terrorism expert who is senior adviser to the Asia Program of the International Crisis Group, an independent conflict monitoring agency.\nSingaporean and Malaysian officials said he had been captured April 1 in southern Malaysia, across the Johor Strait from Singapore, in an area that is home to sympathizers of Jemaah Islamiyah.\n\u201cMas Selamat is under our detention and is being investigated right now,\u201d Hishamuddin Hussein, Malaysia\u2019s home minister, said at a news conference in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. \u201cWe are becoming an expert on him, so hopefully this time he won\u2019t escape us, and the Singaporean experience will help.\u201d\nIn Singapore, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kang Seng said at a news conference that Mr. Mas Selamat had swum across the Johor Strait \u2014 which varies in width from a half mile at its narrowest point to two miles \u2014 using an \u201cimprovised flotation device,\u201d evading the frantic search that had begun as soon as his escape was discovered.\n\u201cThe Malaysian authorities want to interview him, and we will let them do their job, and when they feel it\u2019s time to send him back to us, we will be happy to receive him back,\u201d Mr. Wong said.\nAfter Mr. Mas Selamat\u2019s escape on Feb. 27, 2008, the entire city-state was put on high alert, with the police setting up checkpoints, sealing borders and patrolling parks, marinas and shorelines. People were even urged to keep an eye on their bicycles to keep the fugitive from pedaling to freedom. Singapore was papered with wanted posters, and mug shots were sent to millions of cellphones.\nAn official investigation found that by letting the water run in the washroom and hanging a pair of pants over a ledge above the cubicle door, giving the impression he was still there, Mr. Mas Selamat gave himself 11 minutes to make his getaway, even as a guard waited just outside the door.\nThe escape took place before one of Mr. Mas Selamat\u2019s weekly visits with his wife and children. Prisoners were allowed to change into civilian clothes to meet their relatives, and Mr. Mas Selamat had asked for privacy in the bathroom as he changed.\nAt first, Singapore was filled with false sightings of Mr. Mas Selamat, a round-faced man described on wanted posters as 5-foot-2, weighing 139 pounds and walking with a limp.\nIn the months since, said Ms. Jones, \u201call there\u2019s been is rumors.\u201d Mr. Mas Selamat was reported to be at various locations in Indonesia, where he was born and where the Islamist movement is strong, she said, adding: \u201cThere were all sorts of rumors that he had been killed or had died in the forest while escaping \u2014 that\u2019s the only way his complete disappearance could be explained.\u201d\nNow that Mr. Mas Selamat has been found in what is essentially the base of the regional terrorist movement, Ms. Jones said, \u201cAll the conspiracy theories, of which there were many, are put to rest.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/09/world/asia/09bali.html", "title": "Escaped Bali Terror Suspect Is Caught in Malaysia", "author": "SETH MYDANS"}

But the deal would offer only a temporary solution because Iran has the capacity to replace the 2,600 pounds of nuclear fuel within a year.\nNegotiations concluded in Vienna on Wednesday between Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran\u2019s permanent envoy to the atomic energy agency, and officials from the United States, France and Russia. Mr. Soltanieh cautioned on Wednesday that although he had finished negotiations, the deal was subject to approval by Iran\u2019s leadership.\nDr. ElBaradei set a deadline of Friday for the responses, and by that time Washington, Paris and Moscow all said they had approved the deal.\nThe Obama administration set up the issue as a test of Iran\u2019s intentions. If Iran ships the fuel out of the country, administration officials said, it will restore some confidence that it is not seeking a \u201cbreakout capability,\u201d the ability to expel inspectors and then rapidly produce a nuclear weapon. The White House said forestalling Iran would allow time to negotiate a more comprehensive and difficult agreement, one intended to end all of Iran\u2019s production of new nuclear material.\n\u201cWe think we\u2019ve created a debate within Iran,\u201d one senior administration official said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what some of these negotiations are all about: making the Iranian people decide whether their nuclear ambitions are worth the price.\u201d\nSo far the administration has consistently refused to talk publicly about the deal it struck with Mr. Soltanieh. Officials say they do not want to prejudice the Iranian government against the deal by talking openly about its provisions. Iran, in its comments, has described the United States as backing down in the negotiations.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to give them a reason to say no,\u201d the senior official said.\nIn many ways, the negotiations under way are reminiscent of those with North Korea in recent years, each set of talks aimed at tying up a country\u2019s nuclear fuel and preventing the production of a weapon. In North Korea\u2019s case, that effort failed. A series of agreements for Pyongyang to give up vast parts of its nuclear infrastructure were signed and never executed. The chief negotiator for the United States in Vienna, Daniel B. Poneman, the deputy secretary of energy, is a veteran of those North Korea talks.\n\u201cThere\u2019s every possibility that the Iranian strategy here is to follow the North Korean playbook,\u201d another senior administration official said Friday. \u201cDrag it out. Reach partial agreements. Find reasons not to ship out the fuel.\u201d\nThe question, the official said, is \u201chow long the White House and the Israelis would put up with those tactics.\u201d\nOne problem the Iranian officials face is the concern that at home, any agreement to give up nuclear stockpiles would be regarded as a concession to Washington. Mr. Soltanieh, the Iranian envoy, was clearly cautious about that, taking care in Vienna not to make decisions on behalf of the government he represents.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/world/middleeast/24nuke.html", "title": "Iran Delays Its Decision on Shipping Nuclear Fuel", "author": "DAVID E.

The current average is $75; the North wanted an increase to $300.\nSouth Korean managers said the demand threatened the profitability of 114 South Korean factories operating at Kaesong, a North Korean border town.\nThen on Thursday, without explanation, North Korea scaled back its demand to 5 percent, Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman of the Unification Ministry in Seoul, said in a news briefing.\nNorth Korea also did not repeat its earlier demand that South Korea increase its payments on a 50-year lease of the land at the Kaesong complex. The North wanted a new lease of $500 million, up from the current $16 million.\nThe Kaesong industrial park, where South Korean factories hire North Korean workers to produce goods like kitchen utensils, has served as the most prominent symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It also has provided the North with a much-needed source of hard currency.\nNorth Korea began softening its stance on Kaesong last month by lifting restrictions on travel by trucks and workers between the complex and South Korea. It also released a South Korean worker at Kaesong who had been held for four and a half months on charges of denouncing the North Korean government.\nThe North, however, angered South Korea last weekend when it released water from a dam upriver, causing a flash flood that killed six South Koreans.\nOn Thursday, one of the top officials in North Korea said that the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-il, had no health problems and called speculation about a potential successor \u201cgroundless.\u201d The official, Kim Yong-nam, told the Kyodo news agency of Japan that \u201cwe haven\u2019t even had a discussion on such an issue in our country.\u201d\nMr. Kim is believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008 and had looked sickly in his infrequent public appearances until recently.

In Europe, where many countries opposed the American invasion, the continuing presence of American soldiers coupled with Iraq\u2019s unstable security situation meant that until recently many countries remained skeptical of Iraq\u2019s independence.\nIt was not until last fall, when the United States announced a sure withdrawal and pledged no permanent bases in Iraq, that countries and international organizations began committing in any numbers to opening embassies and making official visits, Mr. Zebari said.\nForty countries now have ambassadors or charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires in Baghdad, along with 12 international agencies, including the United Nations and the Red Cross. In February, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France made the first visit of a French leader to the country since the 2003 invasion, and Frank-Walter Steinmeier became the first German foreign minister to visit Baghdad in 22 years.\nBoth countries had opposed the American invasion, but now seem ready to forge strong ties with Baghdad.\nIn an effort to prove its autonomy, Iraq has invited leaders from Syria and Iran to open embassies, although those countries have an antagonistic relationship with the United States, and Iraq has also reached out to the United States\u2019 global competitors, China and Russia.\n\u201cThey are trying to prove they are independent of the United States and they are trying to draw a clear foreign policy, and we can see other countries are beginning to take Iraq seriously,\u201d said Mustapha Alani, director of defense studies at the Gulf Research Center, an independent group in the United Arab Emirates.\nHarder for Iraq to demonstrate to the world is that it is free of Iranian influence. There are \u201csome doubts in the minds and hearts of some of the Arab countries,\u201d Mr. Zebari said. The country that harbors the greatest uncertainty is Saudi Arabia, one of Iraq\u2019s most powerful neighbors. The Saudis have yet to open an embassy in Baghdad despite repeated invitations and cajoling.\nAlthough the Saudis cite security as the reason for hesitating, the larger reason is that they have yet to trust Iraq\u2019s Shiite-led government, which they fear will favor Iran or even become an Iranian satellite. The Saudis are Sunnis, the Iranians are Shiites, and long before modern borders were drawn, the Arabs and Persians were rivals, along with the Ottomans, for regional hegemony and sought to control the territory that now makes up Iraq.\nPrince Turki al-Faisal, former director of Saudi intelligence and former ambassador to the United States, said at a conference in Amman, Jordan, on Saturday that Saudi Arabia had told the United States previously that when it brought a Shiite-dominated government to power after the 2003 invasion, it \u201chanded Iraq to Iran on a golden plate,\u201d according to the Saudi daily newspaper Al Watan.\nIran\u2019s influence is indisputable. With a $4 billion balance of trade, it is Iraq\u2019s second-largest trading partner, after Turkey. It helps to finance several of Iraq\u2019s Shiite political parties and sends millions of religious tourists to Iraq\u2019s shrines every year.\nMr. Zebari, well aware of Iran\u2019s effort to wield its influence in Iraq, said he has been warning the Saudis lately that if they do not help fill the vacuum as the Americans pull back, then the Iranians will. \u201cWe are saying to them, they should be here: \u2018Why do you complain about expanding influence?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Zebari said. \u201cThey are here and you are not.\u201d\nIran was the first country to recognize Iraq after the American invasion, and it has shrewdly reached out to politicians from all the major sects and ethnicities. With ties to the most powerful politicians, it has been able to maneuver behind the scenes, influencing Iraq\u2019s internal politics and sometimes derailing government policy.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to conduct our relationship with them with a struggle; politically, officially,\u201d Mr. Zebari said.\n\u201cThere are visits; too many visits on both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery week there is a delegation either here by the Iranians or by Iraqi delegations to Iran. Iran has a lot of soft power and they are using it very smartly.\u201d\nPulled between Iran and the Arab world, Iraq appears likely to become a \u201cbuffer state,\u201d said Joost Hiltermann, the senior Iraq analyst at the International Crisis Group, a research organization based in Washington and Brussels. The country\u2019s safety net, whether Iraqis like it or not, is likely to remain the United States.\n\u201cThey will need to distance themselves from the United States publicly,\u201d Mr. Hiltermann said. \u201cBut at the same time they will need to keep very close connections with them. They need them for security. They will need to juggle all the time.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/world/middleeast/15policy.html", "title": "Iraq Tries to Prove Autonomy, and Makes Inroads", "author": "ALISSA J.

Anastasia Isyuk, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Manila, said on television Thursday night that the group was relieved that Ms. Lacaba has been set free but remained worried about the two other hostages.\nRichard Gordon, a senator who chairs the Philippine National Red Cross, told ABS-CBN television Thursday night that he had spoken with Ms. Lacaba and that she had urged the military to take care in its offensive against the Abu Sayyaf for fear of harming the hostages. He said no ransom had been paid for Ms. Lacaba\u2019s freedom.\nMr. Gordon said he had received information that the remaining hostages were still alive.\nMilitary officials refused to give details about Ms. Lacaba, but a photograph released by the military Thursday night showed her being escorted by uniformed soldiers. A radio report said she was wheeled into a military infirmary in a wheel chair.\nThere had been some concern since last week that the military offensive against the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu would lead the Abu Sayyaf to harm the hostages. On Thursday, the Red Cross renewed an earlier appeal for the Philippine authorities to do everything they could to save the hostages and \u201cto avoid taking any action that could put the ICRC staff at risk.\"\nAbu Sayyaf has links to Jemaah Islamiyah, an Islamic group with ties to Al Qaeda.\nMilitant Islamist separatists in the Philippines\u2019 southern islands formed the Abu Sayyaf in the early 1990s. The United States has labeled the group as a terrorist organization, and its ranks, officials here say, have been greatly reduced because of a joint counterterrorism effort by the Philippine and U.S. governments that began in 2002.\nThe authorities blamed the Abu Sayyaf in 2001 when three kidnapping victims were beheaded, and for an attack in 2004 in which a ferry was bombed, killing 100 people.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/world/asia/03phils.html", "title": "Red Cross Hostage in Philippines Is Free", "author": "CARLOS H.

Popular Internet services like Twitter and Hotmail have been disrupted.

The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that a fourth short-range missile was also fired.\nThe spokesman did not provide additional details, but Yonhap called the weapons surface-to-ship cruise missiles and reported that each flew about 60 miles before falling harmlessly into the sea.\nWhile such missiles are routinely tested by the North Koreans, they raised speculation that North Korea might launch a long-range ballistic missile in defiance of a United Nations ban, further heightening regional tensions after the North\u2019s last long-range rocket launching on April 5 and its nuclear test on May 25.\nThe latest missile launchings had been expected, as North Korea declared a no-sail zone last month in waters off its east coast through July 10. News media reports have said that North Korea may launch a barrage of missiles on July 4 to highlight its provocative stance. The North tested a long-range missile on that day in 2006.\nThe missile tests came as Philip Goldberg, an American special envoy who is coordinating sanctions against the North, was scheduled to meet Chinese officials in Beijing. He is seeking support in carrying out the new sanctions outlined in a United Nations resolution passed after the North\u2019s recent nuclear test. The resolution also demanded that the North stop testing ballistic missiles.\nThe new sanctions allow nations to hail a North Korean vessel suspected of carrying weapons and force it into port for an inspection. In recent weeks, an American Navy ship has been trailing a a North Korean freighter, but the vessel reportedly turned around in Southeast Asian waters, aborting what was believed to have been a voyage to Myanmar.\nThe North Korean ship, which American officials suspect was sent out as a ruse, is the first vessel monitored under the new United Nations sanctions, which were adopted after the North\u2019s nuclear test.\nMeanwhile, North and South Korea failed on Thursday to resolve a dispute over fees paid at a joint factory park in the North where South Korean firms hire cheap North Korean labor. The park is a major source of cash for the North.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/world/asia/03korea.html", "title": "North Korea Test-Fires 4 Short-Range Missiles", "author": "CHOE SANG-HUN"}

On Wednesday, Hazel Blears, the communities secretary, became the latest cabinet member to say she would step down. She joins the home secretary and two junior ministers in abandoning Prime Minister Gordon Brown\u2019s front bench before local and European parliamentary elections on Thursday.\nThe general sentiment appears to be: Good riddance to the government, and to politicians in general.\n\u201cNobody knew the extent of their greed,\u201d said Jack Allen, 62, who had a few things to say when Mr. Herbert rang his doorbell. Down the road, 77-year-old Bill Tibbenham said, \u201cThey\u2019re all behaving in a most unsatisfactory manner.\u201d\nAs Mr. Herbert passed by with several local politicians, Claire Simons, 43, said, \u201cIt\u2019s the worst time for them to come out in public, to be honest.\u201d\nAnd so it has been going around the country, as members of Parliament try to drum up support for their party\u2019s candidates and an unpopular cause: politics itself. Though they themselves will not have to run until the next general election, sometime in the coming year, their presence in the campaign is almost a provocation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an awkward time for all politicians,\u201d Mr. Herbert said.\nYou can say that again. Some legislators say they can barely leave the house without being assaulted by questions about what they did and did not spend.\n\u201cThe understandable public anger over the issue of M.P.\u2019s expenses has caused me great stress and has seriously worsened my existing health problem,\u201d Margaret Moran, a Labor member of Parliament, said recently, announcing plans not to seek re-election.\nThe sagging of confidence in the mainstream parties has led to fears that some fringe ones, particularly the extreme right-wing British National Party, will perform well on Thursday. The party, which runs on an anti-immigrant, anti-welfare platform, has typically been able to capitalize on voter disillusionment in picking up local government seats.\nMr. Herbert, who is the Conservative shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, said he welcomed the opportunity to make the case for change. But back in Westminster, legislators\u2019 moods have ranged from gloomy to paranoid.\n\u201cNo one can deny the right to expose this, but any decent human being can question pushing individuals to the brink of despair,\u201d Nadine Dorries, a Conservative member of Parliament, wrote in The Independent. On her blog, she said that the atmosphere was \u201cunbearable\u201d and that \u201ceveryone fears a suicide.\u201d\nThat has not happened, but the circumstances surrounding some of the resignations have been pretty upsetting, at least for the parties involved.\nAndrew Mackay, a top adviser to David Cameron, the Conservative leader, said he would not run for re-election after a raucous public meeting in which a voter called him a \u201cthieving toad.\u201d His wife, Julie Kirkbride, another Tory legislator, said she would step down, too, after thousands of her constituents accused her of criminal behavior in a petition.\nSome legislators, unable to extricate themselves from the outrageousness of their expense claims, have had no choice but to resign. These include the Tory M.P. Sir Douglas Hogg, a k a. \u201cMr. Moat\u201d because he claimed a bill for clearing his moat, and Sir Nicholas and Lady Ann Winterton, a husband-wife Tory team now popularly known as \u201cMr. and Mrs. Expenses.\u201d\nOthers have sabotaged their careers by trying to justify themselves. Their excuses include: ignorance of the rules, inattention to detail, accounting problems, having huge houses that incur huge costs, having small houses that need expensive, streamlined appliances, being too leniently treated by the parliamentary fees office, having trouble juggling home and work, not realizing that staff quarters should be paid for separately and being so rich that other people are jealous of them.\nMembers of Parliament have also clamored to reimburse the government for embarrassing claims, starting with Ms. Blears, who was filmed brandishing a check for nearly $22,000. So far, the BBC says, about 50 members of Parliament have paid $500,000 in reimbursements, a figure that includes the $5 that Mike Penning, the shadow health secretary, gave back for a stainless steel dog bowl.\nMr. Herbert, who, the newspapers said, charged the taxpayer for mortgage interest payments on a house he co-owns with his partner, has weathered the expenses imbroglio relatively unscathed, particularly because it was within the rules.\n\u201cThere are some people who have clearly stepped over the line, and others who made errors of judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, it will be for the electorate to decide.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/world/europe/04britain.html", "title": "British Minister Quits, Dealing New Blow to Brown", "author": "SARAH LYALL"}

A message to Mr. Gore\u2019s spokeswoman on Friday was not immediately returned. In addition, Current TV has removed content relating to the capture of Ms. Ling, a reporter, and Ms. Lee, an editor, on its web site.\nOn Friday, Doug Ling, who lives in Carmichael, Calif., and raised Lisa and Laura as a single father, would say only that \u201cWe hope, wait and pray.\u201d\nMs. Lee has been a video and film editor in San Francisco and, according to her web site is linked with a partner, Michael Saldate, who is an actor and stand-up comic. When reached on Friday, Mr. Saldate also said he could not comment.\nA Facebook group with about 2,400 members has sprung up to show support for the women and members have pledged to hold several rallies: one at the MSNBC studios in New York next month and two next Tuesday, one outside Current TV\u2019s office in San Francisco and the other at the high school that Laura Ling attended in California.\nThe North Korean news agency, KCNA, did not say specifically what charges the journalists will face. But North Korea officials said on March 31 that the reporters would be indicted on charges of \u201cillegal entry\u201d and perpetrating \u201chostile acts\u201d against the Communist state.\nTheir indictment comes amid high tension between North Korea and the United States after the North launched a long-range rocket on April 5. The United States pressed the United Nations Security Council to call for tightened sanctions on the North.\nIn return, Pyongyang told the United Nations\u2019 nuclear monitors last week to leave the country and vowed to quit six-nation talks on dismantling its nuclear weapons facilities. It threatened, too, to restart a plant that makes bomb-grade plutonium.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov confirmed on Friday that North Korea had withdrawn from the talks.\nNorth Korea \u201cis not prepared to return to the negotiating table now,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said at a news conference in Seoul following a visit to Pyongyang earlier this week. \u201cOur common goal is to provide conditions in which the resumption of the negotiations would be possible,\u201d he said.\nThe six-party talks on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula involve North Korea, South Korea, Russia, the United States, Japan, and China.\nAfter Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were arrested under circumstances that are still unclear, they appear to have become part of the political standoff between the governments in Pyongyang and Washington, analysts said, with North Korea likely to use their trial as political leverage against the United States.\nThe United States does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, but a Swedish diplomat based in North Korea has met with the two American journalists on Washington\u2019s behalf. They are being are held in Pyongyang, the capital.\nNorth Korea has said that it would allow the reporters consular access and treat them according to international law. Amnesty International has said it doubted that they will receive a fair trial, given the North Korean judicial system\u2019s lack of independence or transparency.\nNorth Korea also has detained a South Korean worker in a joint industrial complex in the North for almost a month on charges of denouncing the North Korean regime.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/world/asia/25korea.html", "title": "North Korea Decides to Indict 2 U.S. Reporters", "author": "CHOE SANG-HUN"}

A harrowing contraction in the economy is reordering expectations for the future as the country\u2019s leaders grapple with a credit-fueled boom turned to bust.\nTwo brothers, Matiss and Oskars Barkoviskis, see it every day as they make their rounds here in their borrowed Mazda pickup truck. In the three months since they founded a charity for feeding the poor, they have discovered a strong and growing demand for their services.\nIn just that time, the number of families they visit each week has nearly doubled, with new ones answering ads in Riga\u2019s free newspaper every day. They started by delivering groceries down the dirt roads outside Riga and into decrepit, Soviet-era high-rise apartment buildings. But now they find themselves helping out families who live in apparently comfortable surroundings, but who can no longer afford to feed themselves.\n\u201cBefore we started this project, I never thought people could live like this,\u201d said Matiss Barkoviskis, 20. \u201cThere is a sadness that I did not expect.\u201d\nIt is not hard to grasp what stands behind the sour mood in Latvia. Forced into the arms of the International Monetary Fund, the Latvian government is now slashing its budget and the wages of state employees in a bid to rebalance a society that had run badly out of whack.\nAusterity is rippling down the social hierarchy, as the affluent cancel vacations, middle-class people fret about social descent, and Dickensian scenes of destitution multiply.\nIn Riga, the capital, abandoned construction sites, vast lots of repossessed cars and a new, utterly empty shopping mall testify to the misery. But the government\u2019s tough medicine for the crisis, stiffer than Black Balsam, the syrupy herbal liqueur that is the country\u2019s national drink, has defined the times.\nLatvia is racing to halve an enormous government budget deficit, now estimated at 12 percent of gross domestic product, even as its economy is expected to contract by 16.5 percent this year. That is a condition of the $10 billion bailout by the I.M.F. that the European Union, of which Latvia is a member, also supported.\nPrime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, acutely aware that the previous government fell after Riga was shaken by riots in January, must now convince wary lawmakers that the country\u2019s choices have narrowed to bad and worse.\n\u201cThere is a growing awareness of what the problems are, but also what the alternatives are,\u201d Mr. Dombrovskis said in an interview. \u201cThe alternative is not receiving international financing.\u201d\nThe alternative, in other words, is default.\nIn better times, the global financial system would barely flinch at the idea of Latvian insolvency. But the other Baltic countries, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as Romania and Bulgaria and even Western stalwarts like Ireland all gorged on cheap credit and are all groaning under a heavy debt load. The last thing they want to see is a default, which could reignite a crisis that appears to be easing.\n\u201cLatvia is a reminder that there are other countries struggling with huge imbalances, though nobody has turned out as bad as Latvia,\u201d said Lars Christensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen, who has long warned of a convulsion in the region. \u201cSome come pretty close.\u201d\nIn the heady days after it gained membership in the European Union in 2004, Latvia pegged its currency, the lat, to the euro in anticipation of eventually adopting the European currency. Its economy blossomed and Riga, blessed with its abundance of stunning Art Nouveau architecture, emerged as a kind of capital of the Baltics.\nEuro-denominated lending exploded, to the point where 85 percent of household debt was held in euros. But that seemed immaterial at the time, since the euro would soon replace the lat as the country\u2019s currency, or so it was thought.\nThe lat is still with Latvia, however, and so is a colossal problem of how to devalue the currency \u2014 the usual adjustment mechanism in a financial crisis \u2014 without creating a crushing debt burden. Rather than let the currency decline, the government has chosen what it calls an \u201cinternal devaluation,\u201d in which wages are forced downward to restore the economy\u2019s equilibrium.\nIn December, the previous government reduced wages by at least 15 percent for most civil servants, and Mr. Dombrovskis is promising more. The government\u2019s procurement budget was cut by a quarter, while the value-added tax increased to 21 percent from 18 percent. Exceptions for books and hotels fell away; excise duties on alcohol and gasoline rose.\nThe experience is weakening the bonds that Latvians feel for their state. Though proud of their heritage in language and culture, many now speak openly of emigration, and fading memories of citizens standing together with leaders to throw off Soviet domination 19 years ago only accentuate the alienation.\n\u201cIndependence or bondage is an easy question to answer,\u201d said Krisjanis Karins, a former Latvian economy minister. \u201cThis time it is not so cut and dried.\u201d\nGirts, a lanky 40-year-old doctor\u2019s assistant, works three jobs in three hospitals for a monthly salary of $1,350 and spends half his income servicing a euro-denominated mortgage on his apartment.\nThe mood at Latvia\u2019s state-run hospitals, he said, is now one of foreboding, as employees gripe that managers did not share in the pain of a 20 percent wage cut in January \u2014 one that covered all government workers \u2014 and will dodge another later this year. \u201cI have very little faith left in the Latvian state,\u201d said Girts, who asked that his surname be withheld for fear of retribution by supervisors. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer this can go on.\u201d\nFor Latvia\u2019s poor, the mood falls somewhere between bewilderment and frustration, as families struggle to comprehend why their world has come apart.\nIt did not make them rich, but Latvia\u2019s boom over the past few years reached Aija Voitov and her husband, Juris, who live in a two-room shack heated by a crude metal stove down a dirt road outside Riga.\nThough Mr. Voitov switched jobs from time to time, work was plentiful, and Mrs. Voitov had only to walk over to the nearby main road to find work at a big supermarket. Three months ago, Mr. Voitov lost his job at a food processing factory where he had earned $735 a month, a tiny enough sum. Since then, as the family scrapes by on state assistance, Mrs. Voitov confesses little comprehension of exactly what went wrong, only that in the past, things were better.\n\u201cIt was normal, it was good,\u201d Mrs. Voitov said. \u201cThere was plenty of work.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/world/europe/24latvia.html", "title": "Latvia Races to Cut Deficit to Keep to Its Bailout Deal", "author": "CARTER DOUGHERTY"}

Gates said Tuesday that he was more hopeful than he had been in a long time about progress in the war in Afghanistan, but that there would have to be significant improvement a year from now for the American public to support the effort.\nMr. Gates\u2019s comments, made before the Senate Appropriations Committee, were a departure from his previous assessments as well as those of top military commanders that the security situation in Afghanistan was increasingly grim and deteriorating.\nHe provided few details to support his new view but said his optimism came in large part from Pakistan\u2019s offensive against the Taliban in the Swat Valley. Until recently, Pakistan\u2019s army had essentially acquiesced to the Taliban, who had found a haven in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan but are now at war in both countries.\n\u201cThe newest development of the Pakistani Army taking on these extremists, in Swat and elsewhere, I think, is an extremely important development,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cAnd the possibility of the Afghans, the Pakistanis, ourselves and our allies together, working against this problem, has given me more optimism about the future than I\u2019ve had in a long time in Afghanistan.\u201d\nMr. Gates did not mention the refugee crisis in Pakistan in the wake of the army offensive. A huge explosion by militants at a five-star hotel in Peshawar, Pakistan, that killed at least 11 people had yet not occurred on Tuesday when he addressed the panel.\nMr. Gates did say that he had learned Tuesday morning in a video conference with American commanders in Afghanistan that they believed that 2009 would be the first time in 30 years that Afghanistan would not need to import wheat to feed its people, because its own crop was sufficient.\nIn addition, Mr. Gates said, he had been told that the price for wheat was almost the same as the price for opium poppies. Afghanistan\u2019s poppy trade helps finance the Taliban insurgency.\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m grasping at straws, but I thought that was pretty interesting,\u201d he said of the higher wheat price, which could present farmers with an alternative to growing poppies.\nAdm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also appeared at the hearing. Like Mr. Gates, he said the administration had to reverse the trend of violence in Afghanistan over the next 12 to 18 months \u2014 about the time of the midterm elections in the United States \u2014 and that the military would have to reduce civilian casualties.\n\u201cThe more we do that, the more we back up, and it hurts our strategy,\u201d Admiral Mullen said of the civilian deaths.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/world/asia/10military.html", "title": "In Congress, Gates Sounds Positive Note on Afghanistan", "author": "ELISABETH BUMILLER"}
{"date": "Sat, 21 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "DIYARBAKIR, Turkey \u2014 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey took his message of inclusion into the center of Turkey\u2019s Kurdish heartland on Saturday, telling this city, once the center of Kurdish resistance, that its people were \u201cfirst-class citizens.\u201d\nTurkey\u2019s Kurds are at least a fifth of this country\u2019s population and have long been repressed by the Turkish state. Mr. Erdogan told a cheering crowd here that they had equal rights with other citizens, and that his party would devote the same resources to their region in southeastern Turkey, as to the more developed, affluent western part. The speech was part of a campaign tour before nationwide municipal elections on March 29.\nFor years, Turkey\u2019s mostly Kurdish southeast was ignored by mainstream political parties, in part because Turkey\u2019s authorities were fighting an all-out war against a Kurdish separatist group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the P.K.K. But in 2007 Mr. Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party campaigned aggressively to win the Kurdish vote, a strategy that paid off in elections that year, when they swept the southeast.\nStill, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party has not yet managed to conquer Diyarbakir, the largest and most important city in the region.\nThe issue of Kurds here is delicate, and Mr. Erdogan, who in the past shocked nationalist Turks by publicly acknowledging that Turkey had not always treated its Kurdish population fairly, knows that better than anyone. In his hour-and-19-minute speech, he spoke carefully, deftly avoiding giving precise names to the problems of inequality he was describing.\n\u201cWe are all owners of the country \u2014 no one can treat another as a tenant,\u201d he said, standing on a stage in the center of Diyarbakir with the scarf of a local team around his neck, as the crowd waved his party\u2019s flag in the rain.\nHe did not single out Kurds for special treatment, saying that he rejected what he called \u201cethnic nationalism\u201d and politics built on identity.\nAlthough the P.K.K., a militant group, was once popular among Kurds, seen as advancing their rights, it has since lost support. A Kurdish political party, renamed the Democratic Society Party after being shut down several times, has traditionally dominated politics here. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party is its principal competitor, and he is using the full weight of his resources to win votes.\nIt was a point of pride in his speech on Saturday that 65,000 families in the region are getting free coal.\nChanges have been slow, but officials in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party point to successes, including one in which a long-awaited Kurdish broadcast television station has finally gone on the air. But major gaps still remain. Turkish law, for instance, forbids giving speeches in any languages other than Turkish for election campaigns.\n\u201cThis I believe is not very logical,\u201d said Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat, a Justice and Development Party official who was part of the delegation. If someone speaks only one language, he explained, \u201cthen the person asking for his vote should be able to speak in his language.\u201d\nBut Turkey is changing, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think those steps are hard steps.\u201d\nIn his speech, Mr. Erdogan used language that ambitiously placed Turkey as a prominent player on the world stage.\n\u201cThe climate of warmth and brotherhood that spreads out of Turkey breezes through friendly hearts from northern Iraq to the Balkans and Gaza,\u201d he said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/world/europe/22turkey.html", "title": "Turkish Premier Reaches Out in an Important Kurdish City", "author": "SABRINA TAVERNISE"}

{"date": "Wed, 20 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Iran test-fired a sophisticated missile on Wednesday that was capable of striking Israel and parts of Western Europe, adding to concerns that Iran\u2019s weapons-development program is fast outpacing the American-led diplomacy that President Obama has said he will let play out through the end of the year.\nThe solid-fuel Sejil-2 missile used a technology that Iran appeared to have tested at least once before, but the Obama administration nonetheless described the event as \u201csignificant,\u201d largely because missiles of its kind can be relatively easily moved or hidden.\nThe Pentagon confirmed that the test of the missile had been a success, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran\u2019s president, said that the missile \u201clanded exactly on target,\u201d according to Iran\u2019s official news agency.\nMr. Ahmadinejad is up for re-election next month, raising the question of whether the timing of the launching was part of his continuing effort to portray himself as a leader who is reasserting Iran\u2019s role as a power in the Middle East.\nThe Iranian president had been campaigning in the province where the launching took place, and he promised that \u201cin the near future we will launch bigger rockets with bigger reach.\u201d He told a crowd that with its nuclear program, Iran was sending the West a message that \u201cthe Islamic Republic of Iran is running the show,\u201d according to translations of his appearance on Iranian television.\nWhile Mr. Ahmadinejad is often prone to exaggeration, outside experts said that clearly Iran was on a path to producing more reliable, longer-range missiles. In November, Iran\u2019s defense minister, Mostafa Mohammad Najar, was quoted by state-run television as saying the Sejil missile was \u201cvery fast,\u201d could be produced and stored \u201cin mass\u201d and was easy to prepare for launching. Its launcher can immediately be removed from the firing location, he said.\nIts range \u2014 believed to be more than 1,200 miles \u2014 is comparable to the liquid-fueled Shahab III, which Iran first obtained from North Korea. But a solid-fuel rocket, experts said, can be stored in mountains, moved around and reassembled, and fired on shorter notice, and thus could be harder for Israel or other nations to target.\nMr. Najar said Wednesday that the Sejil-2, the version involved in the latest launching, differed from an earlier version of the Sejil in that it \u201cis equipped with a new navigation system as well as precise and sophisticated sensors,\u201d according to Iran\u2019s official news agency.\nCharles P. Vick, an expert on Iranian rockets at the private research group GlobalSecurity.org, in Alexandria, Va., said the launching was part of a broader Iranian effort to develop solid-fueled missiles. The earlier version of the Sejil was fired late last year. Mr. Vick said that the Iranians had now begun to deploy the missiles as military weapons.\nMr. Vick added that Tehran test-fired an even longer-range missile that used solid fuel, the Ashura, in late 2007 and several times afterward.\n\u201cThey\u2019re designing a whole family of solids to replace their liquids,\u201d he said in an interview.\nIt is that transition that has caught the attention of the White House. \u201cI think it is a significant technical development,\u201d Gary Samore, Mr. Obama\u2019s top official for arms control and nuclear security, said at a presentation at the Arms Control Association in Washington. \u201cFrom a mobility standpoint, it is much easier to move around.\u201d\nMr. Samore said he hoped that the Obama administration \u201cwill be able to capitalize on this launch to strengthen our case\u201d on the dangers of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told a Senate panel that she was concerned about a series of developments in Iran that could set off an arms race in the Middle East. She warned that if Iran obtained a nuclear capacity in the next several years, it would constitute an \u201cextraordinary threat,\u201d saying, \u201cOur goal is to persuade the Iranian regime that they will actually be less secure\u201d if it moves ahead with its nuclear program.\nThough she avoided details, Mrs. Clinton was giving voice to a growing concern among administration officials, who have now had time to review the intelligence, that Iran seems to have made significant progress in at least two of the three technologies necessary to field an effective nuclear weapon.\nThe first is enriching uranium to weapons grade, now under way at the large nuclear complex at Natanz. The second is developing a missile capable of reaching Israel and parts of Western Europe, and now the country has several likely candidates. The third is designing a warhead that will fit on the missile.\nThe greatest mystery surrounds the warhead program, which intelligence agencies said in late 2007 had been halted at the end of 2003. Asked Wednesday whether he had seen additional evidence to indicate that the weaponization program had been restarted, Mr. Samore declined to comment.\nIran\u2019s announcement was likely to reinforce Israeli concerns, voiced strongly by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before his visit to Washington this week, about the pace of Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile development programs. But Mr. Netanyahu, facing little other choice, grudgingly supported Mr. Obama\u2019s effort to try direct diplomatic talks with Iran on its nuclear program. Mr. Obama, in a concession to Israeli impatience, said that he expected to make a judgment by the end of the year about whether Iran was making \u201ca good-faith effort to resolve differences\u201d on stopping the nuclear program.\nThe president declined to define what would constitute progress. But after the meeting, a senior Israeli official who met with reporters said the most important measure would be a suspension of Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment program.\nIt is difficult to know how closely linked the launching was to Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s efforts to lift his fortunes in the June election. He was shown after the launching on state television, waving out of an open-roofed car, surrounded by men showering him with confetti.\nAccording to Iran\u2019s Interior Ministry, the electoral authorities on Wednesday confirmed the eligibility of four candidates: Mr. Ahmadinejad; Mir Hussein Moussavi, a moderate politician and a former prime minister; Mehdi Karroubi, another moderate politician and a former speaker of Parliament; and Mohsen Rezai, a former head of the Revolutionary Guards.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/middleeast/21iran.html", "title": "Iran Test-Fires Missile With 1,200-Mile Range", "author": "DAVID E.

{"date": "Tue, 14 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SHANGHAI \u2014 Long before four employees of the Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto were detained here last week on suspicion of stealing state secrets, people working in China\u2019s steel industry were complaining about bribery, deceit and a system turned rotten.\nOne of the tricks is widely discussed. Big government-owned steel makers used their import licenses to buy more iron ore than they needed. Then they profited by illegally selling excess ore to small producers that lacked licenses to import iron ore, a critical ingredient to make steel.\nThis practice, described in detail this week by analysts, traders and industry experts, was part of a system that they say violated industry regulations and bred a culture of corruption.\nSmall steel producers are not supposed to buy supplies from big steel makers that have signed long-term contracts with volume discounts. They are supposed to buy on the iron-ore market, where prices can be volatile. Small producers have long complained that the system favors big state-owned companies.\nThe incentive was there, the small producers said, to cheat by what people in the industry here call \u201crent seeking,\u201d or bribing larger competitors and buying their excess iron ore.\n\u201cRent seeking was everywhere,\u201d said Ren Qiang, general manager of the Zibo Antai Import and Export Company. \u201cSome steel makers set up companies independent from their group to do this selling; others joined cooperative projects with smaller mills to sell their excess iron ore.\u201d\nIndustry officials and people with direct knowledge of the government investigation into the four Rio Tinto employees say the inquiry has now widened to include some of these activities.\nIn the past week, China has questioned or detained at least 10 steel executives, including shipping agents, traders and members of the country\u2019s steel association, according to the state-run news media and interviews with industry officials.\nThe Chinese government has offered no evidence to show whether Rio Tinto or its employees were party to any of these back-room dealings. But last week, Beijing accused the four Rio Tinto employees of espionage, stealing state secrets and harming the nation\u2019s economic interests.\nA government-controlled Web site went into more detail, alleging that state investigators have evidence that the Rio Tinto employees bribed steel executives to get access to confidential government documents that showed production and inventory levels at state-owned steel mills.\nSuch data could presumably have given Rio Tinto an advantage in its annual iron ore price negotiations with Chinese steel mills.\nRio Tinto officials have complained about the lack of formal charges against the employees and insist that the company has tough ethics codes that forbid any bribery. On Tuesday, the company declined to comment further on the case. The Australian government is pressing Beijing for more information about the detention of the four employees, including Stern Hu, an Australian citizen who is Rio Tinto\u2019s top iron ore executive in China.\nWhile Beijing has not formally charged the employees, China\u2019s state-run news media reported Tuesday that computers seized from Rio Tinto\u2019s Shanghai office last week showed the existence of confidential government data.\nChina\u2019s state secrets laws are vague and can apply even to the commercial secrets of state-owned companies, legal experts say.\nOn Tuesday, China Daily, the country\u2019s official English-language newspaper, reported that the government was reviewing iron import licenses held by steel mills and trading companies because of concerns over \u201cspeculative trading.\u201d\n\u201cThe big steel mills saw this as a license to print money,\u201d said Jim Lennon, a longtime steel analyst at Macquarie Securities. \u201cThey said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we set up a side business to do trading.\u2019 \u201d\nThe market was particularly chaotic in 2007 and early 2008, experts say, when many big steel makers began hoarding iron ore supplies because of soaring global demand and then selling it to smaller competitors. Traders say that last year, companies with long-term contracts to buy iron ore at $100 a ton often sold some of that ore on the black market for nearly $200 a ton, or slightly below the spot market price at the time.\nDesperate for iron ore, many small mills bribed industry officials to get those supplies, experts say.\n\u201cThere are 112 enterprises that are qualified importers,\u201d said Xu Zhongbo, a professor at the Beijing University of Science and Technology and an industry expert. \u201cBut China has thousands of small mills, all of them waiting to get iron ore. So that gives big steel makers a great chance to arbitrage.\u201d\nSeveral big steel makers declined to answer questions about their business on Tuesday.\nBut Li Yu, general manager of the Weida Trading Company in Guangzhou, said the government had been trying to stop small steel producers from importing ore or buying it on the black market. He said the program had not been successful.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/world/asia/15riotinto.html", "title": "Mining Company Inquiry Puts Focus on a Black Market in China\u2019s Steel Industry", "author": "DAVID BARBOZA"}

Although Beijing has not renounced its goal of bringing Taiwan under its rule, China is now Taiwan\u2019s principal trading partner, and the two sides began direct tourist flights, cross-strait shipping and mail services last year.\nBut the president also could not afford to block the visit, because a large percentage of the people in Taiwan are Buddhist and he could not risk frustrating them. Mr. Ma has been the focus of intense anger over what many saw as a poor government response to Typhoon Morakot, which left at least 650 people dead.\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to arrive Monday for a six-day tour of southern Taiwan.\nThe invitation to the Dalai Lama, according to news reports, came from the leaders of seven southern cities who belong to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which promotes formal independence and has its traditional base of support in the south.\nAnalysts saw the move as lose-lose for Mr. Ma and win-win for the opposition. George Tsai, a political analyst and professor at Chinese Culture University in Taipei, said Thursday that the invitation was \u201cpurely politically motivated, aiming to harass both Ma and China.\u201d\n\u201cWhile both Ma and Beijing are put in a very awkward position, the D.P.P. is in an absolutely no-lose position,\u201d he said.\nMr. Ma announced the Dalai Lama\u2019s visit while speaking to reporters at a school in the south that was flattened by the typhoon.\nThe president rebuffed a possible visit by the Dalai Lama last November, saying the timing was not right. The Dalai Lama has visited Taiwan before, in 1997 and most recently in 2001, when Chen Shui-bian, Mr. Ma\u2019s predecessor, was president.\nAides of Mr. Ma tried to portray the visit as nonpolitical. \u201cBeijing, of course, they probably have a different explanation, but for Taiwan, the Dalai Lama is visiting only in his capacity as a religious leader,\u201d said David Chen, head of the Liaison and Information Office in Taipei. \u201cHe\u2019s coming to pray for the victims of the typhoon.\u201d\nMr. Chen would not comment when asked whether Taipei had forewarned Beijing of its decision to allow the visit, but he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a factor in cross-strait relations.\u201d\nA statement from one of the cities he is to visit, Kaohsiung, said: \u201cThe Dalai Lama is not only the spiritual leader of Tibet, but also a religious leader. He also embodies love and peace, and has comforted billions of souls over the years. We believe the Dalai Lama\u2019s visit will help the victims get back on their feet.\u201d\nBeijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan, where the Kuomintang forces of Chiang Kai-shek fled after the Communist victory in the civil war in 1949, and has threatened to reclaim the island by force if necessary. Unrest in Tibet is also a highly delicate topic for Beijing, and the Chinese government has sharply criticized the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama, whose government in exile has been based in India since a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959, insists that he only wants genuine autonomy for Tibet.\nThe Dalai Lama\u2019s overseas trips typically draw strong rebukes from China. Beijing withdrew from a summit meeting with the European Union late last year when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and other leaders in the body said they planned to meet with the Dalai Lama.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/world/asia/28taiwan.html", "title": "Dalai Lama Visit Adds to Taiwan Leader\u2019s Troubles", "author": "MARK McDONALD"}

But for politicians who backed the American plan, it was a disappointment and even an embarrassment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a U-turn in the U.S. policy,\u201d said Alexandr Vondra, the former Czech deputy prime minister for European affairs and a strong supporter of the missile-defense system.\n\u201cIt must not undermine security guarantees in central and Eastern Europe,\u201d Mr. Vondra said. \u201cOtherwise the United States may have a problem in generating support for out-of-area missions in this region.\u201d\nA hasty phone call after midnight from Mr. Obama to the Czech prime minister, Jan Fischer, stood in stark contrast to the very public trip to Warsaw by Condoleezza Rice, then the secretary of state, shortly after Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia, barely over a year ago, to sign an agreement about the defense system.\nBut Poland does not appear to be emerging empty-handed from the missile-defense merry-go-round. Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said that the United States would still deploy Patriot missiles as promised. And Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said the United States would base smaller SM-3 missiles on Polish soil if the Polish government still wanted them.\n\u201cThe most important issue is our country\u2019s safety, and that is what we talked about with the American president,\u201d the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cI also spoke about the negotiations themselves, and whether Poland had made any mistakes, but I received the reply from President Obama that the negotiations strengthened the friendship and trust between Poland and the United States.\u201d\nMr. Obama\u2019s announcement on Thursday, however, reinforced a sense that the region \u2014 once at the center of American foreign policy in the days of the Solidarity movement and the broader fight for freedom in the former Communist bloc \u2014 has drifted out of Washington\u2019s focus, compared with problems in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and North Korea. And all are matters on which the United States needs help from Russia, because of its strategic location and veto on the United Nations Security Council.\n\u201cBoth the Czech Republic and Poland realized that America can be pragmatic when it\u2019s about achieving goals,\u201d said Josef Braml, an expert on trans-Atlantic relations at the German Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cAmerica is ready to deal with Russia, and now it\u2019s paid its price for more important issues like Iran and, even more important, Afghanistan.\u201d\nCzech politicians like Mr. Vondra supported the missile-defense program in the face of opposition from a majority of voters at home. And there were less-measured, angrier responses than Mr. Vondra\u2019s. The Web site of the Czech newspaper Lidove Noviny quoted Jan Vidim, a Czech lawmaker from the same center-right Civic Democratic Party as Mr. Vondra, as saying that he felt \u201cgreat disappointment and disgust over Mr. Obama\u2019s cowardice.\u201d\nDecisions about the missile shield, which American officials have always said was intended to block potential attacks from Iran, have been viewed through a different lens in central Europe. The shield was seen as a way to firm up American security commitments, in Poland in particular, an important step in a country where fear of Russia is ingrained by centuries of war, occupation and partition.\nCoincidentally, the announcement on Thursday involved particularly bad timing, coming on the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland after the Nazis attacked from the west. \u201cThe fact that the administration chose this day to announce new plans for this missile defense shield says a lot about the people in the White House who are making the decisions about central Europe,\u201d said Slawomir Debski, director of the Institute of International Affairs in Warsaw.\nPoland has been an unswerving ally of the United States, sending troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, defending President George W. Bush\u2019s war on terrorism and supporting the United States administration over its policies of detentions and renditions. But all the while, public opposition in Poland to the American-led efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan was growing.\n\u201cThe problem here is that people have the sense that we are facing a deeper change in Europe,\u201d said Janusz Reiter, chairman of the Center for International Relations in Warsaw and a former Polish ambassador to the United States and to Germany. The United States\u2019 presence in Europe is decreasing, Mr. Reiter said, while Russia appears to be looking to play a larger role.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/world/europe/18europe.html", "title": "In Face of U.S. Shift, Europeans Recalibrate", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH and JUDY DEMPSEY"}

Outside his office, garbage was piled high in Syntagma Square, a result of a two-week strike by trash collectors that ended Friday.\nA student demonstration was advancing on the square a day after pensioners had taken to the streets. This week, protests for the first anniversary of the death of an Athenian teenager shot by the police turned violent, but did not cause as much damage as disturbances last year.\nCommon in Greece even during better times, such protests are expected to increase drastically once the government introduces austerity measures in its 2010 budget, including wage freezes and measures to scale back public sector hiring, steps it says are needed to bring Greece\u2019s finances under control.\nAs Mr. Papaconstantinou suggested, the problem is not Greece\u2019s alone: heavily indebted countries, including Ireland, Britain and Spain, are under pressure to show that they can stimulate growth and grapple with debt burdens at the same time. Investors and European monetary officials are skeptical.\nGreece, in particular, has to transform a culture with a low tolerance for change and a high tolerance for protest, no easy task for a two-month-old Socialist government that says it is committed to sustaining social spending. While convincing European Union leaders in Brussels, the new government also has to win over Greece.\nThe president of the civil servants\u2019 union Adedy, Spyros Papaspyros, said the union was prepared to strike if cutbacks were unilateral and severe. \u201cIf funding cuts are made in critical sectors such as health or welfare, we create a serious risk of destabilization,\u201d he said.\nThe political and social challenges are intense. \u201cIt will be a very tall order for any country to pull off the fiscal rescue they\u2019ve now got to pull off,\u201d said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London, a research group. In light of Greece\u2019s political challenges, he added, \u201cI find it at this point difficult to see how Greece is going to manage this without some kind of fiscal crisis.\u201d\nCertainly, the bond markets think Greece is a risky bet. Yields on the country\u2019s two-year bonds soared to 3.09 percent from 1.9 percent this week \u2014 the worst for the markets here in more than a decade \u2014 and were about 3 percent on Friday, while the 10-year bond rose to 5.3 percent this week from an already elevated 4.99 percent. In the United States, by contrast, a 10-year bond yields 3.55 percent, and a two-year bond 0.81 percent.\nThe dire economic situation has prompted the question of what went wrong in a country that was once seen as a model for European Union membership and that enjoyed 15 years of sustained growth, coming from behind to host the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t use the Olympic spirit well,\u201d said Elias Clis, a former Greek ambassador. \u201cThe previous government took the safe way, and the safe way is a very dangerous path.\u201d\nAfter winning by a wide margin in October, the Socialist government of Prime Minister George Papandreou announced that the country\u2019s budget deficit was 12.7 percent of the gross domestic product, more than four times the 3 percent ceiling set by the European Monetary Union.\nMr. Papandreou last week estimated the national debt at $430 billion, calling it Greece\u2019s worst crisis in three decades and blaming his conservative predecessors for the economic state. Greece\u2019s national debt is expected to rise above 110 percent of its gross domestic product.\nLast week, the ratings agency Fitch downgraded Greece\u2019s credit rating based on fears that the deficit might cause the country to default, and the change sent Greek shares plunging and made the markets jittery. Standard & Poor\u2019s has said it will reserve judgment until it sees the plan the government is expected to announce in January.\nOn Friday, Mr. Papandreou stressed the need for drastic measures. \u201cWe acknowledge the scale of the problem that we are faced with, and we are determined to make the shift toward a sustainable and healthy economy,\u201d he said in Brussels.\nHe called for a \u201cmerciless crackdown on the corruption that is endemic in society and on widespread tax evasion.\u201d\nYet that is not expected to be easy. The underground economy, which some estimates place as high as 30 percent of gross domestic product, helps people in countries like Greece that have European prices but salaries below the European average.\nAs he sat in a cafe with friends in the chic Kolonaki area on a recent afternoon, Antonis, 33, who disclosed only his first name, proudly announced that he refused to pay taxes.\n\u201cWhy should I pay?\u201d he asked with a grin. \u201cI don\u2019t care about my government; I don\u2019t care about my country,\u201d he added. He conceded, however, that he did care about soccer and women.\nSuch views, while not always so vehement, are common in Greece, where the government is widely seen as corrupt, regardless of who is in power. Few people expect much from the state \u2014 except highly coveted public sector jobs. Today, one in four Greek workers is employed by the state, a result of decades of public hiring to stave off social unrest.\nThe Papandreou administration has said that in 2010 it will hire only one new state worker for every five who retire. But that, too, poses problems. Savas Robolis, a member of the main labor union, the Greek General Confederation of Labor, who serves on a government committee on pension reform, called the pension situation a \u201ctime bomb.\u201d\nHe said Greece had only enough money to pay pensions for one more year. If the country does not replenish the pension funds, \u201cthen we will face a huge social crisis in 10 years,\u201d Mr. Robolis said.\nFears of cutbacks are causing widespread anxiety. Lambrini, who works in the Health Ministry and would give only her first name, said a possible freeze on her $1,300 monthly salary was a real concern for her and her husband, a municipal worker.\n\u201cWe want to plan a family, but I don\u2019t see how we can with such low incomes and with prices going up all the time,\u201d she said.\nShe said she had never joined a labor protest before, but would take to the streets if her salary was frozen or cut. \u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so will half the population.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/12/world/europe/12greece.html", "title": "Greece Struggles to Stay Afloat as Debts Pile On", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO and NIKI KITSANTONIS"}
{"date": "Sun, 30 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s voters cast out the Liberal Democratic Party for only the second time in postwar history on Sunday, handing a landslide victory to a party that campaigned on a promise to reverse a generation-long economic decline and to redefine Tokyo\u2019s relationship with Washington.\nMany Japanese saw the vote as the final blow to the island nation\u2019s postwar order, which has been slowly unraveling since the economy collapsed in the early 1990s.\nIn the powerful lower house, the opposition Democrats virtually swapped places with the governing Liberal Democratic Party, winning 308 of the 480 seats, a 175 percent increase that gives them control of the chamber, according to the national broadcaster NHK. The incumbents took just 119 seats, about a third of their previous total. The remaining seats were won by smaller parties.\n\u201cThis has been a revolutionary election,\u201d Yukio Hatoyama, the party leader and presumptive new prime minister, told reporters. \u201cThe people have shown the courage to take politics into their own hands.\u201d\nMr. Hatoyama, who is expected to assemble a government in two to three weeks, has spoken of the end of American-dominated globalization and of the need to reorient Japan toward Asia. His party\u2019s campaign manifesto calls for an \u201cequal partnership\u201d with the United States and a \u201creconsidering\u201d of the 50,000-strong American military presence here.\nOne change on the horizon may be the renegotiation of a deal with Washington to relocate the United States Marine Corps\u2019 Futenma airfield, on the island of Okinawa. Many island residents want to evict the base altogether.\nThe Democrats, who opposed the American-led war in Iraq, have also said they may end the Japanese Navy\u2019s refueling of American and allied warships in the Indian Ocean.\nThe White House issued a statement on Sunday saying it was \u201cconfident that the strong U.S.-Japan alliance and the close partnership between our two countries will continue to flourish\u201d under the new government. \u201cPresident Obama looks forward to working closely with the new Japanese prime minister on a broad range of global, regional and bilateral issues,\u201d the statement said.\nPolitical analysts expect Japan to remain a close American ally, but one that is more assertive and less willing to follow Washington\u2019s lead automatically.\n\u201cThis is what happens when you have a government in Japan that must be responsive to public opinion,\u201d said Daniel C. Sneider, a researcher on East Asia at Stanford University. \u201cIt will end the habits from decades of a relationship in which Japan didn\u2019t challenge the United States.\u201d\nAt the same time, the Democrats want to improve relations with other Asian countries, including on the touchy issue of history. Analysts say the party seeks to reverse Japan\u2019s growing isolation in the region under decades of right-wing Liberal Democratic rule.\nSuch changes are not likely to come quickly. Diplomatic analysts expect the Democrats to steer clear of security issues for the time being because they could prove too divisive for a party dependent on a broad ideological spectrum.\nAnd some analysts have played down the rhetoric of Mr. Hatoyama, a bushy-haired former management professor, as a nod to his party\u2019s left-leaning base rather than a firm pledge to alter dealings with the United States drastically. In recent interviews, Democratic leaders have insisted there will be no major changes in that relationship.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complete nonsense that a non-Liberal Democratic government will hurt U.S.-Japan relations,\u201d said Tetsuro Fukuyama, a Democratic lawmaker who oversaw production of the campaign manifesto. \u201cBut there are many things left unchanged from the last 50 years that need to be re-examined.\u201d\nAnalysts, however, saw the vote less as an embrace of the Democrats than a resounding rejection of the incumbents. The conservative Liberal Democrats, who with their precursors have held or shared power for 62 of the past 63 years, led Japan from bombed-out rubble to economic miracle, while keeping it firmly in Washington\u2019s camp.\nBut the party has appeared increasingly exhausted and directionless, and Japan\u2019s traditionally apolitical electorate, in a rare display of popular democratic muscle, firmly blamed it for the decline of this former economic superpower and its increasingly cloudy future.\n\u201cWe have been trying to outgrow this old one-party system ever since the collapse of the Berlin Wall,\u201d said Takeshi Sasaki, a political expert and former president of the University of Tokyo. \u201cIt took two decades, but we finally made it.\u201d\nPrime Minister Taro Aso told reporters that he would take responsibility for the defeat, and stepped down Monday as head of the party.\nThe exhilarating sense that Japan had reached a turning point drew long lines of voters to polling stations in Tokyo, where they braved darkening skies from an approaching typhoon. About 70 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, according to NHK, the highest turnout in nearly two decades.\n\u201cI want the Democratic Party to have a go at running the country,\u201d said Akiko Tanaka, a 34-year-old nursing home care worker who voted at a junior high school in the Tokyo suburb of Sayama. \u201cIf we keep going like we\u2019ve been, nothing will get better. We need a new government.\u201d\nA top priority for the new government will be simply maintaining the unity it achieved on Sunday. The largely untested Democrats, a broad coalition of former Socialists and Liberal Democrat defectors, hope to avoid the mistakes of the only previous non-Liberal Democratic government, in 1993, which collapsed in just 11 months because of infighting and defections.\nThat imperative virtually assures no sudden, radical departures in foreign policy. Rather, analysts expect the Democrats to focus at least initially on their more ambitious domestic agenda.\nThe party has pledged to change the postwar paradigm here as well, promising to ease growing social inequality by handing more money and social benefits directly to residents rather than to industry or other interest groups.\nIt has promised to strengthen the social safety net and raise the low birthrate by giving families cash handouts of $270 per month per child. And the party has said it will rein in the powerful central ministries in Tokyo, which have run postwar Japan on the Liberal Democrats\u2019 behalf.\nBut even here, most people have not embraced the party\u2019s platform with much enthusiasm, nor are they optimistic about the Democrats\u2019 ability to solve looming problems like the growing government debt and a rapidly aging population.\nTo many voters, the most important fact of this election was that they finally had a choice.\n\u201cThis vote is about making a system where parties that fail get kicked out,\u201d said Yoshiyuki Kobayashi, 40, one of the white-collar corporate workers known here as salarymen. \u201cWe need to teach politicians to be nervous.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/world/asia/31japan.html", "title": "With Bold Stand, Japan Opposition Wins a Landslide", "author": "MARTIN FACKLER"}

{"date": "Sun, 05 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MANAMA, Bahrain \u2014 It\u2019s O.K. to be Jewish in Bahrain.\nActually, that may be an understatement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fashionable,\u201d said Rouben Rouben, 55, an electronics dealer who proudly displays his name, a recognizably Jewish one, on the sign above all four of his shops in Manama, the capital.\nIn the tense landscape of the Middle East, there is little room left for Jewish Arabs, a tiny minority in this country as well as in places like Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. But in Bahrain, the king, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, has taken unprecedented steps for an Arab leader to show his support for his dwindling Jewish population. Last year, he appointed a Jewish woman, Houda Ezra Ebrahim Nonoo, as ambassador to the United States, the first Jewish ambassador posted abroad by any Arab country.\nThen he made a personal visit to London to appeal to expatriate Jews to return to Bahrain. He has also appointed Jewish business leaders to the Shura Council, which acts as an upper house of Parliament. Those measures went against the tide in a region where anti-Semitism is often preached from government-controlled mosques and hating all Jews has become interchangeable with hating the state of Israel.\n\u201cThe fact that Bahrain has a Jewish community that is in the open and still plays a role in that society is significant and an important symbol for the region,\u201d said Jason F. Isaacson, director of government and international affairs for the American Jewish Committee.\nHowever, it is a community of only 36, and most are older adults. They are mostly descendants of merchants from Iraq and Iran whose families have lived in Bahrain for centuries, experts here said.\nMr. Rouben said that there were about 600 Jews in Bahrain before 1948, when Israel became a state, \u201cbut with every war, more left.\u201d He said that most moved to Europe or the United States.\nFew here expect the community to survive unless some expatriates can be enticed to return. So far, there appear to have been few takers.\nBeing Jewish in the conservative Persian Gulf region still presents challenges, even in Bahrain. Though it has preserved its last synagogue, the building has not had a religious use for decades and all Jewish symbols have been removed. Nevertheless, it is defaced with graffiti that says, in Arabic, \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d\nMost of the Jewish merchants did not want to draw attention to their lives and so declined to be interviewed. Mr. Rouben said that was because \u201cwe don\u2019t want to be thought of as separate.\u201d\nSome people here take a cynical view of their king\u2019s outreach. Bahrain is a close American ally of great strategic value to Washington. It is near Iran and allows the United States Navy to base its Fifth Fleet here. Many people said the king\u2019s overtures were a safe and convenient bid to cement ties with Washington.\n\u201cWe always believe here that control of America is governed by the Zionist lobby,\u201d said Salman Kamal al-Deen, a businessman and the head of the Bahrain Human Rights Society. \u201cThe media and the money are all in the hands of the Jews. We believe if we have a Jewish ambassador and Jews in the Shura Council, this is a positive indicator for the country.\u201d\nThere is also some resentment at the king\u2019s support for the small Jewish community. Bahrain is hot with sectarian tensions: the king, a Sunni Muslim, is accused of discriminating against Shiite Muslims, who make up a majority of the native population. Shiites are barred from almost all positions in the military and security services, and they say they are not given the same employment and education opportunities as their Sunni neighbors.\nShiites complain that the 36 Jews are treated better than they are, and that the king\u2019s Jewish outreach is intended to make Bahrain appear to be a tolerant society, papering over the systemic discrimination they say they experience.\n\u201cBecause there is some religious tolerance in Bahrain, the king\u2019s plan is to undermine the Shiite identity, not increase freedom,\u201d said Habib Muhammad, 25, owner of a welding workshop in the Shiite village of Malikiya. \u201cHe wants to divert people\u2019s attention from demanding their rights.\u201d\nThose charges are rejected by the nation\u2019s leadership and do little to dampen the appreciation American Jews and Bahrain\u2019s surviving Jews have shown for the king\u2019s favor.\n\u201cThe Jews of Bahrain are proud to be Bahraini, proud to be Arab,\u201d said Nancy Khedouri, whose family business is a leading importer of tablecloths and linens and who has written a book on Bahrain\u2019s Jewish history. \u201cWe are truly blessed to be living in an open and hospitable society.\u201d\nA six-member delegation from the American Jewish Committee visited Bahrain on March 18 and presented the king with its Leadership for Peace Award. Bahrain does not have diplomatic relations with Israel but agreed in 2004 to drop its boycott of companies that do business with Israel.\n\u201cThis seems to be very much to us a country that stands against extremism and against the threat of a nuclear and terrorist-sponsoring Iran,\u201d said Mr. Isaacson, of the American Jewish Committee.\nThere are still Jewish shops scattered through the old market. Almost all display their Jewish family names across their storefronts.\nThere was a time when Al Mutanabi Road, just around the corner from Mr. Rouben\u2019s shop in the old market, was known as \u201cJews\u2019 Street\u201d because all the businesses were closed on Saturday. That is not the case anymore.\nBut unlike Saudi Arabia, which has done nothing to preserve or even acknowledge that Jewish Arabs once lived in the Arabian Peninsula, Bahrain has taken steps to preserve its Jewish past. There is also a small Jewish cemetery in Manama, and, except for a pile of construction debris in the corner, it is clean and well tended.\nMr. Rouben said that because the synagogue had not been used since 1948 for religious purposes \u2014 there is no rabbi and there are few observant Jews, he said \u2014 he and other Jewish families wanted to turn it into a commercial property. But, he said, the king would not allow it.\nToday, Mr. Rouben said, there is no tension between him and most of his Muslim neighbors.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t keep to ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cMy best friends are all Muslims.\u201d\nThat is one of those compliments that can cut two ways.\nFouad Shehab, a history professor at Bahrain University, said it was easy to like Mr. Rouben. \u201cI\u2019ve known Rouben for years,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI go to buy from him. I don\u2019t feel he is a Jew.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/world/middleeast/06bahrain.html", "title": "In a Landscape of Tension, Bahrain Embraces Its Jews.

The resolution, he said, \u201cmakes groundless accusations against China\u2019s religious policies\u201d and \u201crudely intervenes in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\nThe Chinese regard the tensions in Tibet as an internal problem and chafe at foreign support for the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader forced to flee Tibet when the 1959 uprising was crushed. The Dalai Lama advocates for genuine Tibetan autonomy, not independence, even though Beijing accuses him of supporting separatism.\nThe anniversary is a particularly delicate time for Tibet. An uprising there this time last year was the largest rebellion against Chinese rule in decades. Beijing, fearful of a repeat, has locked down much of western China with troops and police officers. Foreigners have been barred from the areas, and information has been hard to come by. No reports of large-scale protests have emerged this week.\nXinhua, the state news agency, ran several articles and editorials on its Web site on Thursday denouncing the resolution. One said the resolution \u201cdisregards the history and reality of the Chinese autonomous region by trying to justify Tibet\u2019s dark ages, glorify the treacherous Dalai Lama and baselessly criticize China\u2019s religious policy.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the Dalai Lama, 73, attacked Chinese policies in Tibet in unusually harsh terms, saying China had transformed his homeland into a \u201chell on earth.\u201d\nThe row over the resolution is the second one to emerge between China and the United States this week. On Monday, the Pentagon said it had lodged a formal complaint with Beijing because five Chinese ships had harassed an American surveillance vessel in international waters off the southern coast of China. The Chinese maintain that the American vessel, the Impeccable, was illegally conducting surveillance in waters under their jurisdiction.\nThe naval spat and tensions over Tibet come as China\u2019s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, is meeting with American leaders in Washington. He met with President Obama on Thursday. In a meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Yang and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton discussed Tibet and the naval dispute.\nThe Tibetan movement for greater autonomy draws bipartisan support among American politicians. The resolution on Tibet was written by Representative Rush Holt, a Democrat from New Jersey, and had strong backing from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two met with the Dalai Lama in March 2008 as part of a Congressional trip to India. In 2007, former President George W. Bush presented the Dalai Lama with the Congressional Gold Medal.\nThe dissenting vote was cast by Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/world/asia/13tibet.html", "title": "China Protests a U.S. Resolution on Tibet", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

{"date": "Tue, 10 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Two sophisticated suicide bombings, including one on Tuesday in which 33 people died just outside Baghdad, and other recent violence are raising fears that jihadi militants and hard-line Baathists may be renewing their deadly partnership to threaten the largely calm Iraqi capital.\nIraqi military leaders emphasized that it was too early to draw any firm conclusions but noted similarities in the attacks in which more than 60 people were killed since Sunday. While overall violence in Iraq remains the lowest since the American invasion, both recent attacks were against Iraqi soldiers operating with relatively high security, suggesting much planning and coordination.\nThe worry among some Iraqi military officials is that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a largely homegrown Islamist militant group, and Sunni insurgents loyal to Saddam Hussein and his Baath Party have put aside their differences to destabilize Iraq as the United States military proceeds with its plans to withdraw.\n\u201cWe have said before that Qaeda was broken, but it was not finished,\u201d said Hadi al-Ameri, the chairman of the Security Committee in the Iraqi Parliament and the leader of the Badr Organization, the former armed wing of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, a Shiite political party.\nIf in fact the partnership is renewed, Iraqi officials speculate that they may be seeking to exploit several recent vulnerabilities around Baghdad.\nThere is deep infighting among Sunni tribes that united to help subdue the insurgency over the last two years. Thousands of detainees have been released in recent months from American jails. And relatively inexperienced Iraqi forces have now taken the lead in most of the capital area as American forces withdraw to large bases as a first step towards leaving the country.\nIn the second major suicide bombing in three days, the attack on Tuesday, in which 46 people were wounded, took aim at a group of Iraqi Army officers on their way to a high-profile reconciliation conference on the western outskirts of the capital.\nWild shooting followed the explosion as emergency medical workers dragged limp bodies to ambulances and sheep stumbled through the blood-streaked wreckage to escape the bullets. An investigation is under way to determine whether the shooting after the bombing was an ambush by gunmen or undisciplined gunfire by Iraqi security forces, said Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, spokesman for the Baghdad security plan.\nAt least 7 of the 33 people killed were Iraqi Army officers.\nWitnesses described a scene of confusion and carnage that was also captured on television by a cameraman for the state channel Iraqiya who was wounded in the attack along with a correspondent for the state channel. A correspondent and cameraman for another channel, Baghdadiya, were killed in the blast.\nThe attack took place as a senior Iraqi security official, accompanied by high ranking army officers, was touring the Abu Ghraib market in an effort to highlight the new security as tribal leaders gathered for a reconciliation meeting nearby.\n\u201cI saw some of the corpses were riddled with bullets,\u201d said Abu Jamal al-Zubaie, who lives near the market.\nAs best he could tell, most of the firing was done by security guards protecting the visiting dignitaries. After the shooting subsided, angry residents rushed to help the wounded and search through the debris. Mr. Zubaie said that \u201cangry locals were pointing at the flesh\u201d of what they said was the bomber, cursing his name. The remains appeared to be those of a male, he said.\nOn Sunday, 28 people were killed when a suicide bomber driving a motorcycle laden with explosives blew up near the police academy in Baghdad.\nFor several months, tribal leaders and Iraqi military officials have been worrying over signs that Qaeda groups might be renewing their alliance with a burgeoning wing of the hard-line Sunni insurgency, called Al Auda. The group\u2019s name means the Return and advocates a return to power of Mr. Hussein\u2019s outlawed Baath Party.\nThe hard-line Baathist movement announced on its official Web site Tuesday that it would spurn any reconciliation with the new Iraqi government, which it described as \u201ccollaborators, spies and traitors.\u201d\nTribal leaders pointed to a spate of recent assassination attempts. Awad al-Harbousi, one of the leaders of the Awakening movement near Taji, north of Baghdad, said gunmen killed one of his Awakening brethren on Sunday and wounded a second one. Some of the attackers now use bicycle bombers instead of car bombs, he said.\n\u201cThe Iraqi security forces have refused to do anything in our area,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have many arrest warrants against people, but because the Americans withdrew from our area the Iraqis are afraid to go after them without air support. We will face a disaster.\u201d\nOne new dynamic the extremists appear to be trying to exploit is the sharpened rivalries among the tribes after elections in which many competed against one another for provincial council seats, said several security officials.\n\u201cThe tensions between the tribes mean that instead of being focused on the threat from Al Qaeda, they are focused on their own rivalries,\u201d said Mr. Ameri, the Parliament member.\n\u201cAll the tribes have been hurt by Al Qaeda,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd there is no tribe that would want to work with Al Qaeda.\n\u201cBut they have to be ready to fight Al Qaeda and not one another,\u201d he said.\nAlthough the number of bombings with double-digit casualties has remained at a relatively low level for the past three months \u2014 and Baghdad parks and markets are crowded with families \u2014 behind the blast walls a growing unease is palpable.\nSmaller attacks are more frequent even if they are not lethal. Hardly a day goes by without an assassination attempt using a sticky bomb, a relatively new mode of attack. For the first time in months in Baghdad, there was an attack using a Katyusha rocket.

{"date": "Mon, 09 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MUNICH \u2014 The war in Afghanistan will be \u201cmuch tougher than Iraq,\u201d President Obama\u2019s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan said at a security conference here on Sunday.\n\u201cThere is no magic formula in Afghanistan,\u201d the envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, warned an audience of European policy makers and military planners. \u201cThere is no Dayton agreement in Afghanistan,\u201d he added, referring to the peace accord he negotiated to end the war in Bosnia. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long, difficult struggle.\u201d\nMr. Holbrooke was part of a high-level American delegation at the annual Munich Security Conference over the weekend. The group, led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and including Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, the head of the United States Central Command, did not paint a rosy picture of the situation in Afghanistan.\nThe American view of Afghanistan\u2019s problems differed from that of the country\u2019s president, Hamid Karzai, who also spoke Sunday.\nWhile Mr. Karzai acknowledged the security problems, he said that great progress had been made, from roads to schools to health services. In an address that at times sounded defensive, he said Afghanistan was neither a \u201cnarco-state\u201d nor a \u201cfailed state,\u201d as critics have labeled it.\nMr. Karzai called again for reconciliation with Taliban forces \u201cwho are not part of Al Qaeda, who are not part of terrorist networks, who want to return to their country.\u201d He also criticized NATO over the number of civilian casualties it has caused in the course of battling the insurgency.\nAn opinion survey published Monday said that, among Afghans, support for the Karzai government and the presence of American forces was still high, but falling. The poll, commissioned by three broadcasters -- the BBC, ABC News of the United States and ARD of Germany -- tested opinion among 1,500 Afghans divided equally between men and women in all 34 of Afghanistan\u2019s provinces. Most respondents said the Taliban represented the biggest danger to their country.\nAmerican officials at the Munich conference questioned the gap between Mr. Karzai\u2019s presentation of reality and what they see as the facts on the ground. The pervasive corruption in the country is viewed as a central reason that the Afghan leader has fallen out of favor with the Obama administration. Mr. Karzai faces an election in August.\nGeneral Petraeus\u2019s comments, on the other hand, were greatly anticipated. He is widely credited for the improved security situation in Iraq, where he was the senior commander during the troop increase known as the surge. Expectations are running high that he can repeat the success of that strategy in Afghanistan.\nGeneral Petraeus spoke of the need for outposts and patrol bases in the provinces. \u201cYou can\u2019t commute to work\u201d when conducting counterinsurgency operations, he said Sunday. \u201cA nuanced appreciation of local situations is essential\u201d to understanding \u201cthe tribal structures, the power brokers, the good guys and the bad guys, local cultures and history,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere has been nothing easy about Afghanistan,\u201d said General Petraeus, adding that he \u201cwould be remiss if I did not ask individual countries to examine very closely what forces and other contributions they can provide\u201d ahead of the elections in August. He said needs included not only ground forces but also an array of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, military police officers, special operations, cargo and attack helicopters and more. Mr. Obama is planning to send as many as 30,000 additional troops to try to turn the tide in the war against insurgents.\nSome NATO allies have been slow to contribute additional forces.\nIn his comments, General Jones was critical of the effort to stabilize the country thus far. \u201cThe international coordination was spotty at best,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tended to focus too much on the military reconstruction part, which was important but not the only thing that should have been done.\u201d\nThe Americans were not alone in their calls for a more robust effort. Radek Sikorski, the foreign minister of Poland, called Afghanistan a test for NATO, and emphasized that the security situation had to improve immediately. \u201cIf this year we don\u2019t turn the tide, it\u2019s going to be much harder later on,\u201d he said.\nBritain\u2019s defense secretary, John Hutton, made what may have been the harshest comments directed at the alliance\u2019s prosecution of the war, accusing NATO of an obsession with bureaucracy. \u201cWhat I want from NATO is more of a wartime mentality,\u201d he said.\nIn an interview on Saturday, Vice President Biden expressed sympathy for Mr. Karzai for the challenges he faces in governing Afghanistan. \u201cKarzai has an incredibly difficult job,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDo I think \u2014 me speaking, Joe Biden \u2014 think he could do more? Yes. Do I understand why from his perspective he might think he couldn\u2019t do more? Yes. Does there ultimately over the next year have to be a change in appointing strong governors? Having a police force that is free of corruption? Cracking down more on the corruption within his own government? The answer is yes. Yes, all of the above has to occur.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/world/asia/10afghan.html", "title": "Holbrooke Says Afghan War \u2018Tougher Than Iraq\u2019", "author": "NICHOLAS KULISH and HELENE COOPER"}

Nixon and the Soviet prime minister, Nikita S. Khrushchev, debated the merits of capitalism and Communism in a model American kitchen built at an exhibition center in Moscow. At that exhibit, Mr. Khrushchev also tried Pepsi. The company became an exclusive soft-drink supplier to the Soviet Union under a 1973 agreement that also allowed the Soviets to export Stolichnaya vodka to the United States.\nPepsiCo, the beverage and snack-food giant based in Purchase, N.Y., said its investment in Russia came during a wider push into developing markets.\n\u201cRussia is a very attractive growth market,\u201d said the chief executive of the Pepsi Bottling Group, Eric J.

But the remark was the latest in a number of recent conciliatory overtures from the North.\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, North Korea restored regular traffic for South Korean companies that have operations in a joint industrial park in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. The North had sharply curtailed such traffic in December.\nThe border will now open 23 times a day to traffic to and from Kaesong, up from 6 times, said Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman with the Unification Ministry in Seoul. About 110 South Korean factories employ 40,000 North Korean workers at Kaesong.\nIan Kelly, a State Department spokesman, said Monday that Washington was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the North\u2019s recent gestures toward the South, but he said he had no comment on the North\u2019s call for a peace treaty.\nMr. Kelly urged North Korea to return to six-nation talks with regional powers about the dismantling of its nuclear weapons programs. The North, which prefers a bilateral dialogue with the United States, has said the six-nation framework is dead.\nAlso on Tuesday, a diplomatic delegation left Pyongyang, the North\u2019s capital, for a visit to Beijing, according to KCNA, the official North Korean news agency.\nChina is North Korea\u2019s principal trading partner and its biggest supplier of aid.\nWashington has said that negotiating a peace treaty with the North is possible only as part of a broader process that addresses the North\u2019s nuclear disarmament.

{"date": "Tue, 03 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TEHRAN \u2014 Iran has fired a satellite into orbit and a shot across the bow of American diplomacy.\nIts first orbital launching, announced Tuesday, coincided with celebrations of the 30th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and raised concerns in the United States and other countries about Iran\u2019s potential use of long-range missiles to send warheads halfway around the globe.\nThe rocket apparently went up late Monday night or early Tuesday morning.\nWeapons experts agreed that the act was mainly a symbolic accomplishment because the satellite was very small. Launching a heavy warhead intercontinental distances would require a far more powerful missile.\nThe launching comes as President Obama has struck a conciliatory tone toward Tehran, suggesting that he will move toward dialogue after years of tensions. Even so, he may take a tough line in the coming months and could seek to tighten sanctions against Iran.\nIn using its own rocket to launch the satellite, Iran joined eight other nations that have used their own technologies to send objects into orbit. Amateur observers have already spotted the bright craft in the night sky.\n\u201cIn the face of world opposition and sanctions, Iran has joined a very exclusive club,\u201d said Geoffrey E. Forden, a missile expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He called the step a genuine \u201ctechnological feat.\u201d\nThe United States and other Western nations suspect that Tehran wants to develop nuclear arms, an accusation Iran\u2019s leaders deny. On Iranian television, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad praised the launching. \u201cDear Iranian nation,\u201d he said, \u201cyour children have placed the first indigenous satellite into orbit.\u201d\nHe stressed that it was Iranian experts who had built the satellite and the rocket. \u201cWith God\u2019s help and the desire for justice and peace,\u201d he said, \u201cthe official presence of the Islamic republic was registered in space.\u201d\nIn Washington, the State Department called the event worrisome. \u201cIran\u2019s development of a space launch vehicle establishes the technical basis from which Iran could develop long-range ballistic missile systems,\u201d said Robert A. Wood, a department spokesman.\nAerospace experts said the action had a number of potential military implications, even though the satellite was small and lightweight compared with a nuclear warhead.\nWhen the Soviet Union launched the first satellite into space in 1957, the action shook the world mainly because of the relatively fine technical line that exists between rockets that can launch spacecraft into orbit and those that can loft warheads over long distances.\nAerospace experts said Iran had now taken a significant step down that road. Its launching of the satellite took many years of preparation and required the mastery of staging \u2014 the art of creating a multistage rocket that drops stages, and thus weight, as it races ever higher.\nBut the experts said the step represented no immediate military threat and no reason to rush the deployment of antimissile arms in Europe, which the Bush administration sought to counter the threat of Iranian missiles.\n\u201cThis is no reason to panic,\u201d Charles D. Ferguson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t force us to make a missile defense decision in Europe.\u201d\nHe said Iran\u2019s action had more to do with sending a message to Washington and asserting influence as a regional power than with achieving a new military capability. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for the Iranian people to stand proud,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to do it in a way that is still within a civilian program.\u201d\nIn Iran, state-run television showed images on Tuesday of the liftoff of the rocket carrying the satellite, which is called Omid, meaning hope. IRNA, the official news agency, reported that it went into orbit as a data-processing project and was \u201cthe first practical step toward acquiring space technology.\u201d\nCharles P. Vick, an expert on Iranian rockets at a private research group, GlobalSecurity.org, in Alexandria, Va., said the launching was a major accomplishment after years of delays, failures and setbacks.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been at this game for about five years,\u201d he said.\nThe United States and other governments have been carefully monitoring Iran\u2019s efforts to develop more powerful missiles.\nThe Iranian rocket had two stages, Mr. Vick said. If it were carrying a small warhead, he said, the Iranian missile could fire the weapon about 2,500 kilometers, or slightly more than 1,550 miles. The rocket could send a weapon to targets in Israel, but experts said that Iran had already possessed that capability.\nThat falls short of the range of an intercontinental ballistic missile, Mr. Vick said. For Iran to achieve that technical step, he added, it would have to develop a more powerful basic rocket or more upper stages \u2014 two goals that weapons experts think it is pursuing.\nDr. Ferguson of the Council on Foreign Relations said that Iran\u2019s technical advance, if translated into a military missile, might put a warhead within range of southern Europe, including Turkey, Greece and Italy.\nAlthough Iran has a reputation for technical legerdemain, experts agree that the satellite launching was genuine. Dr. Forden of M.I.T. said amateur observers around the world had tracked its starlike twinkling and listened to its radio signals.\nHe added that the satellite\u2019s trajectory was taking it as high as a 55-degree-north latitude and that the small spacecraft was visible from all of the continental United States.\nExperts said the United States was closely tracking two objects: the satellite and the rocket\u2019s second stage, which also went into orbit. A commercial Web site, Real Time Satellite Tracking, n2yo.com/?s=33506, features what it calls a ground track showing the satellite's movements.\nThe nations that have previously managed to loft satellites into orbit are Russia, the United States, France, Japan, China, Britain, India and Israel.\nOver the years, Tehran\u2019s efforts to build a fleet of large rockets, and to buy and make satellites, have received technical help from Russia, China, India, Italy and North Korea.\nAerospace experts said Iran\u2019s growing fleet of rockets had drawn most heavily on aid from North Korea. Mr. Vick of GlobalSecurity.org said the first and second stages of the rocket that had lofted the satellite were based on North Korean designs.\nIran has come under increasing pressure from the West over its efforts to enrich uranium. The United Nations Security Council has imposed three sets of sanctions on Iran, including missile-related embargos, and has called on it to suspend its enrichment activities. Iran has refused and insists that the effort is for peaceful, civilian purposes.\nDavoud Hermidas Bavand, a political analyst and professor of international law at Allameh Tabatabaee University in Tehran, said the satellite launching could elevate Iran\u2019s status and might lead to a change of tone toward Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\u201cTheir success shows that Iran has achieved a major technological progress,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt is also a matter of prestige for Iran because it has joined the space club, which has very few members.\u201d\nIranian engineers began building the satellite in February 2006, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported, and it was ready for tests after two years. It said the communications satellite weighed just 27 kilograms, or about 60 pounds.\nIn Israel, Yiftah Shapir, an expert on ballistic missiles and space technology at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, played down the launching as an event that was expected and had little military significance. The Iranians \u201calready have missiles that can reach Israel,\u201d he said. So for at least one country, he added, this was \u201cnothing new.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/world/middleeast/04iran.html", "title": "Iran Launches Satellite in a Challenge for Obama", "author": "NAZILA FATHI and WILLIAM J.

{"date": "Thu, 27 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "Khalid bin Mahfouz, a billionaire Saudi banker who paid $225 million to settle charges of bank fraud in 1993 and later won a string of lawsuits in Britain against writers who had accused him of supporting terrorism, died Sunday at his home in Jidda. He was 60.\nThe cause was a heart attack, according to reports in the Arab news media.\nIn many ways, Sheik Mahfouz typified Saudi Arabia\u2019s super-wealthy. He maintained opulent homes around the world and traveled in his own Boeing 767 with gold-plated bathroom fixtures. Last year, the magazine Arabian Business ranked him 24th in its list of the 50 richest Arabs, with a fortune estimated at $3.35 billion.\nHe rose to prominence through his 30 percent ownership in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was shut down in 1991 after charges of financial chicanery and money laundering. Sheik Mahfouz paid $225 million to settle fraud charges by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office and the Federal Reserve.\nDistrict Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said $37 million of the settlement was a fine. But Sheik Mahfouz denied that any of the settlement was a fine, pointing out that he had not acknowledged any wrongdoing. He said he had agreed to the settlement \u201cpurely as a business decision.\u201d\nAfter the September 2001 terrorist attacks, considerable suspicion fell on Saudi financiers and charities as sources of financing for terrorism. Partly because so much money passed through his bank and a charity he helped establish, Sheik Mahfouz faced a barrage of accusations in books, newspapers and magazines that he and his family had funneled money to Al Qaeda.\nHe vehemently denied that and repeatedly and often successfully pressed publications for corrections. He also took advantage of Britain\u2019s pro-plaintiff libel laws to sue publishers, almost all of whom settled before trial.\nOne writer who fought back was Rachel Ehrenfeld, author of \u201cFunding Evil: How Terrorism Is Financed \u2014 and How to Stop It\u201d (2003). Sheik Mahfouz won a default judgment in 2005 ordering her to apologize, destroy all copies of the book and pay him roughly $230,000 in damages. Ms. Ehrenfeld has called his legal actions \u201cfinancial jihad.\u201d\nBut Sheik Mahfouz\u2019s criticisms were sometimes irrefutable. He was widely referred to as the brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden, which he was not. Sheik Mahfouz did acknowledge contributing $270,000 to Mr. bin Laden\u2019s forces when they were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan. At the time, the United States also supported the insurgents there.\nSheik Mahfouz\u2019s father was Salem bin Mahfouz, who was 6 when he and his brothers arrived in Mecca in 1912. Salem bin Mahfouz was employed for many years exchanging currency for pilgrims to Mecca. In 1949, he became a partner in a lucrative currency business and quickly decided that the enterprise would be much more successful if it were constituted as a bank.\nBanks, however, were illegal because the Koran condemned the charging of interest as usury. So the elder Sheik Mahfouz, who was illiterate, went to the Saudi royal family and argued that Saudi Arabia should be self-sufficient in banking; at the time, the only two banks in the kingdom were foreign. He proved persuasive: the National Commercial Bank was established in 1953, and it became the bank of the royal family at a time when oil revenues soared. The bank laid the foundation for Saudi Arabia to join the global financial community.\nKhalid bin Mahfouz took over the bank after his father died, while his 11 siblings and his mother consolidated their inheritance into a large holding company. Sheik Mahfouz is survived by his wife, Na\u2019elah Kaaki; his sons Abdulrahman and Sultan, and his daughter, Eman.\nSheik Mahfouz was born in 1949 and received his primary and secondary education in Jidda. When he joined National Commercial Bank, he first worked as a cashier. Later, as an executive, he developed securities trading, investment funds and corporate banking.\nIn 1977, he joined John Connally, a Washington insider, and others to buy the Main Bank of Houston. Mr. Connally introduced him to William Herbert Hunt and Nelson Bunker Hunt, Texas billionaires who recruited him to join an ultimately unsuccessful scheme to corner the silver market. Various reports say that Sheik Mahfouz and other Saudis lost money in the effort.\nDuring these years, Sheik Mahfouz lived in Houston. The Washington Post reported in 1981 that his neighbors seldom saw him, knowing him only as \u201cthe Saudi.\u201d From their swimming pools, they would watch his helicopter fly over the neighborhood.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/world/middleeast/28mahfouz.html", "title": "Khalid bin Mahfouz, Saudi Banker, Dies at 60", "author": "DOUGLAS MARTIN"}
{"date": "Wed, 25 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Taliban\u2019s widening campaign in southern Afghanistan is made possible in part by direct support from operatives in Pakistan\u2019s military intelligence agency, despite Pakistani government promises to sever ties to militant groups fighting in Afghanistan, according to American government officials.\nThe support consists of money, military supplies and strategic planning guidance to Taliban commanders who are gearing up to confront the international force in Afghanistan that will soon include some 17,000 American reinforcements.\nSupport for the Taliban, as well as other militant groups, is coordinated by operatives inside the shadowy S Wing of Pakistan\u2019s spy service, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, the officials said. There is even evidence that ISI operatives meet regularly with Taliban commanders to discuss whether to intensify or scale back violence before the Afghan elections.\nDetails of the ISI\u2019s continuing ties to militant groups were described by a half-dozen American, Pakistani and other security officials during recent interviews in Washington and the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. All requested anonymity because they were discussing classified and sensitive intelligence information.\nThe American officials said proof of the ties between the Taliban and Pakistani spies came from electronic surveillance and trusted informants. The Pakistani officials interviewed said that they had firsthand knowledge of the connections, though they denied that the ties were strengthening the insurgency.\nAmerican officials have complained for more than a year about the ISI\u2019s support to groups like the Taliban. But the new details reveal that the spy agency is aiding a broader array of militant networks with more diverse types of support than was previously known \u2014 even months after Pakistani officials said that the days of the ISI\u2019s playing a \u201cdouble game\u201d had ended.\nPakistan\u2019s military and civilian leaders publicly deny any government ties to militant groups, and American officials say it is unlikely that top officials in Islamabad are directly coordinating the clandestine efforts. American officials have also said that midlevel ISI operatives occasionally cultivate relationships that are not approved by their bosses.\nIn a sign of just how resigned Western officials are to the ties, the British government has sent several dispatches to Islamabad in recent months asking that the ISI use its strategy meetings with the Taliban to persuade its commanders to scale back violence in Afghanistan before the August presidential election there, according to one official.\nBut the inability, or unwillingness, of the embattled civilian government, led by President Asif Ali Zardari, to break the ties that bind the ISI to the militants illustrates the complexities of a region of shifting alliances. Obama administration officials admit that they are struggling to understand these allegiances as they try to forge a strategy to quell violence in Afghanistan, which has intensified because of a resurgent Taliban. Fighting this insurgency is difficult enough, officials said, without having to worry about an allied spy service\u2019s supporting the enemy.\nBut the Pakistanis offered a more nuanced portrait. They said the contacts were less threatening than the American officials depicted and were part of a strategy to maintain influence in Afghanistan for the day when American forces would withdraw and leave what they fear could be a power vacuum to be filled by India, Pakistan\u2019s archenemy. A senior Pakistani military officer said, \u201cIn intelligence, you have to be in contact with your enemy or you are running blind.\u201d\nThe ISI helped create and nurture the Taliban movement in the 1990s to bring stability to a nation that had been devastated by years of civil war between rival warlords, and one Pakistani official explained that Islamabad needed to use groups like the Taliban as \u201cproxy forces to preserve our interests.\u201d\nA spokesman at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington declined to comment for this article.\nOver the past year, a parade of senior American diplomats, military officers and intelligence officials has flown to Islamabad to urge Pakistan\u2019s civilian and military leaders to cut off support for militant groups, and Washington has threatened to put conditions on more than $1 billion in annual military aid to Pakistan. On Saturday, the director of the C.I.A., Leon E. Panetta, met with top Pakistani officials in Islamabad.\nLittle is publicly known about the ISI\u2019s S Wing, which officials say directs intelligence operations outside of Pakistan. American officials said that the S Wing provided direct support to three major groups carrying out attacks in Afghanistan: the Taliban based in Quetta, Pakistan, commanded by Mullah Muhammad Omar; the militant network run by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar; and a different group run by the guerrilla leader Jalaluddin Haqqani.\nDennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, recently told senators that the Pakistanis \u201cdraw distinctions\u201d among different militant groups.\n\u201cThere are some they believe have to be hit and that we should cooperate on hitting, and there are others they think don\u2019t constitute as much of a threat to them and that they think are best left alone,\u201d Mr. Blair said.\nThe Haqqani network, which focuses its attacks on Afghanistan, is considered a strategic asset to Pakistan, according to American and Pakistani officials, in contrast to the militant network run by Baitullah Mehsud, which has the goal of overthrowing Pakistan\u2019s government.\nTop American officials speak bluntly about how the situation has changed little since last summer, when evidence showed that ISI operatives helped plan the bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul, an attack that killed 54 people.\n\u201cThey have been very attached to many of these extremist organizations, and it\u2019s my belief that in the long run, they have got to completely cut ties with those in order to really move in the right direction,\u201d Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said recently on \u201cThe Charlie Rose Show\u201d on PBS.\nThe Taliban has been able to finance a military campaign inside Afghanistan largely through proceeds from the illegal drug trade and wealthy individuals from the Persian Gulf. But American officials said that when fighters needed fuel or ammunition to sustain their attacks against American troops, they would often turn to the ISI.\nWhen the groups needed to replenish their ranks, it would be operatives from the S Wing who often slipped into radical madrasas across Pakistan to drum up recruits, the officials said.\nThe ISI support for militants extends beyond those operating in the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan. American officials said the spy agency had also shared intelligence with Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistan-based militant group suspected in the deadly attacks in Mumbai, India, and provided protection for it.\nMr. Zardari took steps last summer to purge the ISI\u2019s top ranks after the United States confronted Pakistan with evidence about the Indian Embassy bombing. Mr. Zardari pledged that the ISI would be \u201chandled,\u201d and that anyone working with militants would be dismissed.\nYet with the future of Mr. Zardari\u2019s government uncertain in the current political turmoil and with Obama officials seeing few immediate alternatives, American officials and outside experts said that Pakistan\u2019s military establishment appears to see little advantage in responding to the demands of civilian officials in Islamabad or Washington.\nAs a result, when the Haqqani fighters need to stay a step ahead of American forces stalking them on the ground and in the air, they rely on moles within the spy agency to tip them off to allied missions planned against them, American military officials said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/world/asia/26tribal.html", "title": "Afghan Strikes by Taliban Get Pakistan Help, U.S. Aides Say", "author": "MARK MAZZETTI and ERIC SCHMITT"}
{"date": "Sat, 20 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TEHRAN \u2014 Police officers used sticks and tear gas to force back thousands of demonstrators under plumes of black smoke in the capital on Saturday, a day after Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said there would be \u201cbloodshed\u201d if street protests continued over the disputed presidential election.\nSeparately, state-run media reported that three people were wounded when a suicide bomber attacked at the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the southern part of the city, several miles from the scheduled protests. The report of the blast could not be independently confirmed.\nThe violence unfolded on a day of extraordinary tension across Iran. The opposition leader, Mir Hussein Moussavi, appeared at a demonstration in southern Tehran and called for a general strike if he were to be arrested. \u201cI am ready for martyrdom,\u201d he told supporters.\nMr. Moussavi again called for nullifying the election\u2019s results, and opposition protesters swore to continue pressing their claims of a stolen election against Iran\u2019s embattled and increasingly impatient clerical leadership in Iran\u2019s worst crisis since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nIn Washington, President Obama called the government\u2019s reaction \u201cviolent and unjust,\u201d and, quoting Martin Luther King Jr., warned again that the world was watching what happened in Tehran.\nIran\u2019s divisions played out on the streets. Regular security forces stood back and urged protesters to go home to avoid bloodshed, while the feared pro-government militia, the Basij, beat protesters with clubs and, witnesses said, electric prods.\nIn some places, the protesters pushed back, rushing the militia in teams of hundreds: At least three Basijis were pitched from their motorcycles, which were then set on fire. The protesters included many women, some of whom berated as \u201ccowards\u201d men who fled the Basijis. There appeared to be tens of thousands of protesters in Tehran, far fewer than the mass demonstrations early last week, most likely because of intimidation.\nThe street violence appeared to grow more intense as night fell, and there were unconfirmed reports of multiple deaths. A BBC journalist at Enghelab (Revolution) Square reported seeing one person shot by the security forces. An amateur video posted on YouTube showed a woman bleeding to death after being shot by a Basiji, the text posted with the video said.\n\u201cIf they open fire on people and if there is bloodshed, people will get angrier,\u201d said a protester, Ali, 40. \u201cThey are out of their minds if they think with bloodshed they can crush the movement.\u201d\nMr. Obama\u2019s statement was his strongest to date on the post-election turmoil in Iran. Saying that \u201ceach and every innocent life\u201d lost would be mourned, he added: \u201cSuppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government. If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect the dignity of its own people and govern through consent, not coercion.\n\u201cMartin Luther King once said, \u2018The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u2019 I believe that. The international community believes that. And right now, we are bearing witness to the Iranian people\u2019s belief in that truth, and we will continue to bear witness.\u201d\nThere had been varying reports in the hours leading up to the opposition rally about whether it would be called off in the face of the government\u2019s threatened crackdown. State television reported that Mr. Moussavi had called it off, but some of his supporters, posting on social networking sites, urged demonstrators to gather.\nJournalists were banned from leaving their offices to report on the protests. A reporter from an American news organization said she had been called by a member of the Basij militia warning her not to go to the venue for the Saturday rally because the situation would be dangerous and there could be fatalities.\nThe authorities were also reported on Saturday to have renewed an offer of a partial recount of the ballots in the disputed election \u2014 an offer that the opposition has previously rejected. A letter from Mr. Moussavi published on one of his Web sites late Saturday repeated his demand for the election to be annulled.\n\u201cThe Iranian nation will not believe this unjust and illegal\u201d act, he said in the letter, which was addressed to the powerful Guardian Council, a panel of clerics which oversees and certifies election results. Making his case for electoral fraud, he charged that thousands of his representatives had been expelled from polling stations and some mobile polling stations had ballot boxes filled with fake ballots.\nIn a long and hard-line sermon on Friday, Ayatollah Khamenei declared the June 12 election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad valid and warned that demonstration leaders \u201cwould be responsible for bloodshed and chaos\u201d if demonstrations continued.\nRegional analysts said that, by calling for an end to the rallies, Ayatollah Khamenei had inserted himself directly into the confrontation, invoking his own prestige and that of Iran\u2019s clerical leaders. But his speech also laid the groundwork to suppress the opposition movement with a harder hand, characterizing any further protests as being against the Islamic republic itself.\nIran\u2019s National Security Council reinforced Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s warning on Saturday, state media reported, telling Mr. Moussavi to \u201crefrain from provoking illegal rallies.\u201d\nThe demand came in a letter from the head of the council after a formal complaint by Mr. Moussavi that law enforcement agencies had failed to protect protesters.\n\u201cIt is your duty not to incite and invite the public to illegal gatherings; otherwise, you will be responsible for its consequences,\u201d the letter said, according to state media.\nOn Saturday morning, security forces \u2014 regular and riot police officers, and the Basij \u2014 were deployed in huge numbers around Tehran and, unconfirmed reports said, other major Iranian cities. The reports of confrontations came not only from northern Tehran, a hotbed for the opposition, but in the south, generally considered more supportive of Mr. Ahmadinejad.\nAmateur video posted to the Web showed scenes of chaos and gunfire, some of it as vividly violent as in the clashes on Monday that left at least seven people dead. One video posted on the BBC Farsi service showed streets on fire and a large crowd fleeing amid several rounds of semiautomatic gunfire. A photo showed the riot police repelling demonstrators with a hand-held water cannon.\nThe Basij militia completely blocked off Enghelab Square, one major gathering ground for the protesters. They are less accountable than regular security forces and, many witnesses said, were far more violent on Saturday.\n\u201cPlease go home,\u201d one regular officer told protesters. \u201cWe are scared of the Basijis, too.\u201d\nOne woman who lives off Vali Asr Square, near where the protests took place, said Basijis beat and kicked anyone outside, shouting at them to return to their houses.\n\u201cThe streets near our house were full of Basijis wearing helmets and holding batons,\u201d she said.\nThe government warned that it would step up the pressure on the opposition from its regular security forces if it continued to stage demonstrations.\n\u201cWe acted with leniency, but I think from today on, we should resume law and confront more seriously,\u201d Gen. Esmaeil Ahmadi Moghadam said on state television. \u201cThe events have become exhausting, bothersome and intolerable. I want them to take the police cautions seriously because we will definitely show a serious confrontation against those who violate rules.\u201d\nIn a measure of the scale of the opposition\u2019s complaints, one losing candidate in the June 12 election, Mohsen Rezai, a conservative former commander of the Revolutionary Guards, claimed to have won between 3.5 million and 7 million votes compared with the 680,000 accorded to him in the first announcement of results a week ago, state-run Press TV reported Saturday.\nWitnesses said that Mohammad Ghoochani, a prominent journalist and editor in chief of several reformist publications that had been shut down, was arrested Saturday by the authorities. There were no further details of his condition or location.\nThe authorities had also invited the three opposition candidates to attend a meeting on Saturday with the 12-member Guardian Council, the panel of clerics which oversees and certifies election results. But only one candidate \u2014 Mr. Rezai \u2014 attended, Press TV said.\nThe panel has been presented with 646 complaints of electoral irregularities, the authorities have said.\nMr. Moussavi has expressed mistrust of the panel, accusing some of its members of campaigning before the election for Mr. Ahmadinejad.\nPress TV quoted Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, the council\u2019s spokesman, as saying the body was investigating complaints including shortages and delays in the supply of ballot papers, the denial of access to polling stations by candidates\u2019 representatives and intimidation and bribery of voters.\n\u201cAlthough the Guardian Council is not legally obliged,\u201d Mr. Kadkhodaei was quoted as saying, \u201cwe are ready to recount 10 percent of the ballot boxes randomly in the presence of representatives of the candidates.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/world/middleeast/21iran.html", "title": "Violence Grips Tehran Amid Crackdown", "author": "THE NEW YORK TIMES"}

{"date": "Fri, 09 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Five small bombs exploded outside theaters in Lahore, Pakistan\u2019s second-largest city, hours after Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. arrived here in the capital to meet the country\u2019s military and civilian leaders.\nNo one was killed, and only a handful of people were wounded. But the blasts set off a panic, with ambulances and crowds going to the scene, and they served as a reminder of the problems that many analysts believe could make Pakistan one of the toughest foreign policy challenges for Mr. Biden and President-elect Barack Obama.\nAll the bombs appeared to be small explosives that could have done far greater damage had they been more powerful, according to accounts provided by authorities to the Pakistani news media.\nPolice officers searched for other hidden bombs and rushed to guard theaters in Lahore, the cultural hub of Pakistan. There were no immediate claims of responsibility, though one suspect was arrested. The governor of Punjab Province, Salman Taseer, suggested that \u201canti-Pakistani elements\u201d were to blame.\nIt was not clear why anyone would set off so many low-power bombs in busy areas, unless they were intended only for intimidation. There was speculation that the blasts were a continuation of low-intensity bombings in Lahore last October that struck juice shops known as \u201cdating points,\u201d with enclosed booths for young couples to cuddle.\nOne person was killed and several wounded in those attacks. An unknown group claimed responsibility and warned of more attacks against \u201ccenters of immorality\u201d in the city.\nBombs and other terrorist attacks have soared in Pakistan as thousands of Taliban militants have come to dominate the country\u2019s tribal areas.\nAt the same time, Pakistan\u2019s eastern border with India is now the most tense it has been in years, after the November attacks in Mumbai, which left more than 160 people dead and drastically worsened relations between the nuclear-armed countries.\nDuring a meeting here on Friday with the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, Mr. Biden discussed the Mumbai attacks, according to a senior Pakistani government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity according to diplomatic protocol. Mr. Biden talked in depth about the long-term relationship between the United States and Pakistan and how the challenges of Islamic militancy in Pakistan and Afghanistan were closely linked, the official said.\nMr. Biden, the Pakistani official said, spoke about how progress in Afghanistan required that the problem of Islamic militancy in Pakistan also be addressed. Mr. Biden\u2019s \u201cfocus was more on Afghanistan, how to stabilize it and how to defeat the Taliban and Al Qaeda,\u201d the official said.\nHe also said Mr. Biden had not only met with Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, chief of the Pakistani Army, but also took the unusual step of meeting with Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the newly appointed leader of the country\u2019s main spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or the ISI.\nAn aide to Mr. Biden declined to comment on the meetings, except to say that the vice president-elect emphasized to the Pakistani officials that he was not making any commitments on the part of the incoming administration, and that Mr. Biden was mainly in a \u201clistening mode\u201d during the sessions.\nPakistan\u2019s civilian government is new and shaky, and much real power has historically rested with military commanders and top-ranking spymasters who have had a history of militant sympathies. Pakistani leaders contend that those militant loyalties are now in decline, but some American officials are skeptical.\nOfficially, Mr. Biden is traveling in a fact-finding capacity as a senator, a job he will leave shortly to be sworn in with Mr. Obama on Jan. 20. But among Pakistani officials the trip was widely viewed as the first visit by the Obama administration.\nMr. Biden has been chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and he is expected to vie for influence on foreign policy with Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state-designate.\nThe integrity and allegiance of Pakistani security forces are a critical focus for Mr. Biden. He sponsored legislation that would greatly expand nonmilitary aid to Pakistan for schools, hospitals and other programs, but it could also curtail arms sales and billions of dollars in military aid \u2014 unless Pakistani security forces demonstrate a serious commitment to action against militants.\nAs leaders in Islamabad continued to grapple with mounting evidence that Pakistani militants had carried out the attacks in Mumbai, and as American officials pressured Pakistan to be more forthcoming, the prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, suggested on Friday that the country had taken a step toward cooperating with India.\nMr. Gilani told reporters that the ISI had provided \u201cfeedback\u201d to the Indian government on a 52-page dossier of evidence that he said India had shared with the Central Intelligence Agency, and which was then given to the Pakistanis.\nThe Pakistani group blamed for the Mumbai attacks, Lashkar-e-Taiba, was founded in the 1980s with significant help and money from the ISI, whose officers viewed the militants as ideological allies and proxy troops against enemies that included the Indian forces in Kashmir.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/world/asia/10pstan.html", "title": "As Biden Meets Pakistani Leaders, Bombs Rattle a Cultural Hub", "author": "RICHARD A.

{"date": "Wed, 13 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The United States military for the first time has provided Pakistan with a broad array of surveillance information collected by American drones flying along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, American military officials said Wednesday.\nBut it is not clear whether the cooperation will continue. While American military drones flew a handful of noncombat surveillance missions along the border earlier this spring at the request of the Pakistani government, requests for additional flights abruptly stopped without explanation, the officials said.\nThe offer to give Pakistan a much larger amount of imagery, including real-time video feeds and communications intercepts gleaned by remotely piloted aircraft, was intended to help defuse a growing dispute over how to use the drones and which country should control the secret missions flown in Pakistani airspace, American officials said.\nIn meetings last week with President Obama and other American officials in Washington, Asif Ali Zardari, Pakistan\u2019s president, repeated his insistence that Pakistan be given its own armed Predator drones to attack operatives of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the country\u2019s tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan. But the American intelligence operatives who fly the armed drones inside Pakistan remain opposed to joint operations with Pakistani intelligence services, pointing out that past attempts were a failure. Several years ago, American officials gave Pakistan advance word of planned Predator attacks, but stopped the practice after the information leaked to militants.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going after terrorists plotting directly against the United States and its interests,\u201d said one American counterterrorism official. \u201cNobody wants to gamble with those kinds of targets. We tried a joint approach before, and it didn\u2019t work. Those are facts that can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d\nAmerican military officials said Wednesday that there was no plan to allow the military to join the C.I.A. in operating armed drones inside Pakistan. They disputed a report in The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday that said Pakistan had been given joint control of armed American military drones inside Pakistan. Obama administration officials are vigorously resisting sharing the drone technology with Pakistani security forces, but officials from both countries said compromises were possible.\nAmerican and some Pakistani officials spoke anonymously because the C.I.A. drone operations are classified.\nPakistani officials said that Mr. Zardari wanted the drone technology partly to tamp down anger inside Pakistan over the campaign of C.I.A. airstrikes inside the country, which have killed civilians in addition to more than a dozen Qaeda leaders. If Pakistan had its own Predators, they said, the government in Islamabad could make a more plausible case to the public that Pakistani missiles, not American missiles, were being used to kill militants.\n\u201cPakistan\u2019s concerns about the drones do not relate to their ability to take out bad guys, they relate to the collateral damage and concerns about national sovereignty,\u201d said Husain Haqqani, Pakistan\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\nAs a compromise, the American military in Afghanistan a few months ago offered to increase the amount of sensitive surveillance information it shared with the Pakistani military. American officials said the information could help Pakistani forces combat an increasingly lethal militancy that was spreading not only in the tribal areas, but also in the settled areas of Swat and Buner, closer to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. American and Pakistani officials said that such information-sharing initiatives could build trust between the security services of both nations.\nIn mid-March, the American military in Afghanistan flew a demonstration mission of a Predator drone along a stretch of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to show the kind of imagery and communications information the Predator could provide. The Americans transmitted the information to a border coordination center near the Khyber Pass operated by American, Pakistani and Afghan personnel, and the information was sent through Pakistani security databases.\nThe test run went well enough that Pakistan subsequently requested a small number of additional Predator reconnaissance flights to support their operations in the border tribal areas.\nBut American officials said the requests for additional surveillance missions ended suddenly in early April. \u201cThere was no reason given, it just stopped,\u201d said one senior American defense official. American officials suggested that the change could be the result of internal divisions in the Pakistani military over how closely to cooperate with the Americans on intelligence.\nFor its part, the Obama administration has provided the Pakistanis with the surveillance information but has resisted sharing detailed information about how the drones operate. \u201cThis is technology we haven\u2019t given to our closest allies \u2014 the Brits or the Australians or NATO,\u201d said one senior American official who is working on Pakistan issues.\nInfusing this debate is a continuing suspicion by American intelligence officials of the premier Pakistani spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. Because the Predators, and now an even more sophisticated drone called the Reaper, have been among the most successful weapons against Qaeda and other militant leaders, there is deep concern that any information about the drones\u2019 operating patterns, blind spots, and takeoff and landing locations could be leaked to the insurgents and used to take down the drones.\nAs the fighting in Swat unfolded this week, missiles fired by a remotely piloted American drone killed 15 people, suspected of being militants, in a village in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas on Tuesday. The missiles, apparently three in all, hit a suspected safe house operated by local militants in Sra Khawra, a village that sits on the border between the tribal agencies of North and South Waziristan.\nIt was the 18th American drone attack in Pakistan so far this year, compared with 36 in all of last year.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/world/asia/14drone.html", "title": "In a First, U.S. Provides Pakistan With Drone Data", "author": "ERIC SCHMITT and MARK MAZZETTI"}
{"date": "Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SAN SALVADOR \u2014 Having sent the Iranian people a video greeting on their New Year, President Obama is now inviting them to help celebrate a quintessentially American holiday, the Fourth of July.\nLast Friday, the State Department sent a cable to its embassies and consulates around the world notifying them that \u201cthey may invite representatives from the government of Iran\u201d to their Independence Day celebrations \u2014 annual receptions that typically feature hot dogs, red-white-and-blue bunting and some perfunctory remarks about the founding fathers.\nAdministration officials characterized the move as another in a series of American overtures to Iran. The United States has not had relations with Iran since the American Embassy in Tehran was seized by protesters in 1979; the country\u2019s diplomats have not been formally invited to American events since then.\n\u201cIt is another way of saying we are not putting barriers in the way of communicating,\u201d said one administration official. \u201cIt is another way of signaling that there is an opportunity that should not be wasted.\u201d\nA second official said the ban no longer made sense, at a time when the United States was actively engaging with Iranian officials elsewhere. In March, the administration\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, chatted with Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Mehdi Akhondzadeh, at a conference in The Hague.\nThe authorization to issue the invitations was disclosed by a senior State Department official on the eve of a three-day visit to Latin America by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the new policy was not public.\nEven as the United States reaches out to Tehran, it is trying to reclaim American influence in Latin America, where Iran has made inroads while the United States has been waging wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nOn Monday, Mrs. Clinton was in El Salvador to attend the inauguration of Mauricio Funes, whose election as president represents the first time the country has swung to the left since its civil war ended in 1992. She will be in Honduras on Tuesday for a meeting of the Organization of American States. The United States is expected to face intense pressure from Cuba\u2019s neighbors to reinstate the island\u2019s membership in the group.\nMrs. Clinton has said Iran\u2019s rising influence in the region is \u201cquite disturbing.\u201d In May, she told State Department employees that the Bush administration\u2019s policy toward Latin America had created an opening for Iran and China, which are using commercial and other assistance to bolster anti-American leaders like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua.\n\u201cThey are building strong economic and political connections with a lot of these leaders,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s in our interest.\u201d\nWhile Iran\u2019s influence in the region is dwarfed by that of China \u2014 which is a huge buyer of raw materials from Latin American countries \u2014 Tehran\u2019s role has touched a nerve among senior administration officials like Mrs. Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who has also spoken publicly about it.\n\u201cThe specter of Iran raises red flags in a way that China doesn\u2019t, because China tends to respect the American sphere of influence,\u201d said Julia E. Sweig, a Latin American expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nIran\u2019s motives are murkier, according to administration officials. It has cultivated wide-ranging economic ties with Venezuela and, to a lesser extent, Nicaragua. But it has also been linked to the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994, which killed 85 people.\nIran is not known to have a big presence in El Salvador, officials said, and it was not represented at Mr. Funes\u2019s inauguration. But the change in power after 17 years of a pro-American right-wing government could offer an opening.\nMr. Funes\u2019s victory continues the ascension of the political left across Latin America; some analysts worry he will adopt the anti-American rhetoric of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador. His party, the F.M.L.N., has its roots in guerrillas who fought El Salvador\u2019s American-backed army in the 1980s and 1990s. But Mr. Funes is viewed as more centrist than his party. American officials said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presence was meant to signal that Washington would not take El Salvador for granted.\n\u201cSome might say President Obama is left of center,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said after meeting with Mr. Funes.\nSpeaking earlier to American diplomats, she alluded to the vagaries of American influence in the region.\n\u201cSome of the difficulties we\u2019ve had historically in forging strong and lasting ties in our hemisphere,\u201d she said, \u201care a result of our perhaps not listening, perhaps not paying close enough attention.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/world/02diplo.html", "title": "A New Iran Overture, With Hot Dogs", "author": "MARK LANDLER"}

{"date": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 After a lengthy inquiry, investigators commissioned by the European Union are expected to conclude that Georgia ignited last year\u2019s war with Russia by attacking separatists in South Ossetia, rejecting the Georgian government\u2019s explanation that the attack was defensive, according to an official familiar with the investigators\u2019 work.\nBut the report is expected to balance this conclusion with an equally weighty one: If Georgia fired the first shot, Russia created and exploited the conditions that led to war, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the report had not yet been made public.\nIn the years preceding the conflict, Russia encouraged separatist movements in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, territories in Georgia, training their military forces and distributing Russian passports.\nThe European Union inquiry is the most authoritative investigation into the causes of the August 2008 war, which battered Georgia and brought relations between Russia and the West to a post-cold-war low. Russia and Georgia have both maintained that they acted defensively. With feelings still raw in both countries, each has heavily lobbied the international community to condemn the other party.\nInvestigators have closely guarded the report\u2019s contents, which will be presented to the European Union\u2019s Council of Ministers at noon on Wednesday and then released to the public.\nBy blaming both countries, the report seems unlikely to resolve the debate over which bears more overall responsibility. Most countries have already taken a firm position on the enclaves, which only Russia, Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized as sovereign nations. Europe and the United States have uniformly accused the Kremlin of changing Georgia\u2019s borders by force, and of violating the \u201csix-point agreement,\u201d a French-brokered cease-fire that required Russia to withdraw its troops to prewar positions.\nBut the inquiry will break ground by determining who started the war. The president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, has said he had no choice but to order the shelling of Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital, variously explaining that it was necessary to stop attacks on Georgian villages, to bring the region under control or to deter a Russian invasion already in progress.\nGeorgia has also released telephone intercepts from Ossetian border guards that purport to show that a Russian armored regiment crossed into South Ossetia a full day before Georgia\u2019s attack on Tskhinvali.\nRussia\u2019s claims are also likely to come under scrutiny. The Kremlin has said it invaded Georgia to protect Russian citizens, based on Moscow\u2019s practice of distributing Russian passports to citizens of the separatist enclaves; it also claims it was compelled to stop a genocide, invoking a grave principle in international law.\nRussia has also asserted the right to defend its peacekeeping troops legally stationed in South Ossetia, a claim that may prove more durable. But it is not clear how far that reasoning would extend, since Russian troops did not simply take control of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but moved into central Georgia and conducted bombing raids there. Russia then recognized both territories as sovereign nations and offered to protect their borders, effectively cutting off a fifth of Georgia\u2019s territory.\nLed by a Swiss diplomat, Ambassador Heidi Tagliavini, the inquiry, known as the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia, was begun in December amid debate in Europe over how strongly to back Georgia in its continuing conflict with Russia. Eastern European countries said Russia\u2019s policies in Georgia epitomized Moscow\u2019s dangerous expansionist tendencies. Some in Western Europe were more skeptical of Mr. Saakashvili, who had made regaining control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia a goal of his presidency.\nThe dispute has quieted since then. An attempt to topple Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s government by domestic opposition has failed, and NATO and the United States have embarked on a tentative warming with Russia. Georgian leaders, who still enjoy strong political support from Washington, say they have accepted that they will not regain control of the territories by force, or quickly.\nNevertheless, the report has been awaited with some anxiety. The release, originally scheduled just before the anniversary of the war, was delayed for two months when new documents became available. The European Union\u2019s monitoring mission announced last week that it would step up its patrols near the conflict zones this week, to ward off any violence that might occur.\nA veteran diplomat, Ms. Tagliavini has spent years monitoring conflicts in Georgia and Chechnya. She commissioned reports on specific topics from military and legal experts across the political spectrum. She also sent out extensive questionnaires to the governments of Russia, Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\nTemuri Yakobashvili, Georgia\u2019s minister for reintegration, said in an interview last week that there was ample evidence of Russia\u2019s military preparation for the war, and that \u201cwhat the Russians are trying to do is shift the debate to who fired the first bullet.\u201d\nIn any case, he said, the findings are not likely to affect Western policy toward Georgia. \u201cOur policy doesn\u2019t really depend on the report; our policy depends on the facts on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far we have a clear situation where Russia is not complying to the six-point agreement\u201d signed in August 2008.\nThis year, Mr. Yakobashvili publicly accused two researchers associated with the commission of pro-Russian bias, saying they worked for organizations financed by Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly. Last week, however, he sounded more confident. \u201cThey had an opportunity to express their opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, the question is how much of the opinion will be expressed in the report.\u201d\nA spokesman for Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry, Igor S. Lyakin-Frolov, said it was too early to comment on the report because officials had not had a chance to read it. He said the Russian side had been \u201cabsolutely fair and honest\u201d with Ms. Tagliavini\u2019s commission and felt optimistic about the report\u2019s objectivity.\nHe said Russian officials were hoping that the commission would allocate some blame to the countries that had helped arm Georgia, in particular Ukraine. He added that Russia would consider it unfair if the commission divided blame for the war equally.\n\u201cIt was Georgia that started the aggression and hostilities,\u201d Mr. Lyakin-Frolov said.\nHe, too, said he did not expect the conclusions to have a major impact on policy toward Russia, noting that the topic of Georgia came up only briefly during meetings at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\u201cWe should concentrate on the issues that concern the world: the financial issues, the political issues, Iran, North Korea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to me that there are more important questions that are being discussed by the leaders of our countries.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/world/europe/29georgia.html", "title": "E.U.

{"date": "Mon, 14 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "ATHENS \u2014 Under intense pressure to rein in Greece\u2019s soaring budget deficit, Prime Minister George Papandreou on Monday announced ambitious measures to reassure Europe and investors that he had an exit route out of the country\u2019s worst crisis in decades.\n\u201cWe need to move immediately to a new social deal,\u201d the prime minister said in a highly anticipated speech to business groups and labor unions. \u201cWe must change or sink. Our biggest deficit is the deficit of credibility. Markets want to see action, not words.\u201d\nGreek bond markets were thrown into turmoil last week when Fitch Ratings downgraded Greece\u2019s credit rating on fears that the country\u2019s soaring budget deficit and heavy debt might cause the country to default. Greece\u2019s deficit is 12.7 percent of the gross domestic product, and its debt is estimated at 300 billion euros, or about $440 billion, more than 110 percent of gross domestic product.\nGreece\u2019s financial crisis poses a critical challenge for the European Union, with the credibility of the euro as much at stake as that of Greece. If other countries in the bloc rush to Greece\u2019s aid \u2014 and so far they have not \u2014 their help would be seen as rewarding bad behavior. But if they leave Greece to fend for itself, or to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, they could spread the panic to Spain, Ireland and other member nations in dire financial straits.\nIn his speech on Monday, Mr. Papandreou tried to allay Europe\u2019s fears. He vowed to reduce state spending by 10 percent and to bring the budget deficit to less than 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2013. He said he would introduce a new progressive tax scale, crack down on rampant tax evasion and cut bureaucracy to attract foreign investment.\nMr. Papandreou also called for reform of Greece\u2019s struggling pension system, which by some estimates will run out of money within a year. He said that starting in 2011, Greece would hire one new state worker for every five who retired. One in four Greeks works for the state, a result of decades of public-sector hiring to prevent social unrest.\nMr. Papandreou said his government would soon \u201cmake decisions that haven\u2019t been made in decades.\u201d He added: \u201cThe state is hostage to vested interests that hamper the fair management of state funding. We are ready to clash with these interests.\u201d\nA problem for the newly elected Mr. Papandreou is that the most powerful vested interests include the public sector unions, which are among his constituents. Yet, in an indication of the gravity of the crisis, everyone from the leaders of labor unions to business leaders seems to be reserving judgment about the Papandreou government, fearing that any criticism might further weaken Greece\u2019s hand.\nYet some wondered how exactly Mr. Papandreou would be able to carry out his ambitious plans. \u201cWill you really clash with these vested interests?\u201d Yiannis Politis, a prominent political commentator on Greek state television, asked after the prime minister\u2019s speech. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing these promises for years from different governments and have never seen any action.\u201d\nMr. Papandreou must walk a fine line between making good on his promise to Brussels that Greece can rein in its public spending and reassuring Greece\u2019s strike-prone public sector workers that he will not cut their salaries.\nIn a nod to his Socialist base, Mr. Papandreou also pledged in his speech to raise public sector wages in line with inflation. And a gasp could be heard in the audience of business leaders when he announced a 90 percent tax on private sector banking bonuses.\nWithout fast action, Greece\u2019s credit rating may suffer further damage, causing it to pay more to borrow the 50 billion euros, or about $73 billion, it says it needs in 2010 to pay its bills. In October, Moody\u2019s Investors Service put Greece on notice for a possible credit downgrade. On Monday, a Moody\u2019s team was in Athens. Its decision is expected shortly.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/world/europe/15greece.html", "title": "Greek Leader Offers Plan to Tackle Debt Crisis", "author": "RACHEL DONADIO"}
{"date": "Thu, 29 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "RAFAH, Egypt \u2014 From the rooftops you can see tall buildings, and trucks pulling through streets teeming with people. You can hear generators humming, and the rumble of construction gear. From the rooftops, you can see Gaza.\nBut down below on the streets here, it is quiet, the kind of quiet that says people have been driven out. Stores were long ago abandoned. The street is buckled in places, and litter is piled along the curb. Residents have fled the war over the border, the heavy pressure from Egyptian security, the emptiness of life in Rafah.\n\u201cAll we have,\u201d said Muhammad Sha\u2019er, as he looked from a rooftop into Gaza, \u201care the tunnels.\u201d\nEarly Wednesday morning, Israel again bombed the tunnels that stretch under the border from Gaza into Egypt. The bombings followed a 22-day Israeli offensive to stop Hamas\u2019s rocket fire, which was followed by international negotiations aimed at ending smuggling into Gaza.\nBut here in Rafah, people were still trying to smuggle goods through tunnels, hours before and hours after the bombing Wednesday morning. Rafah is a bleak, rutted, dusty town that bears more than passing resemblance to Baghdad after years of international sanctions.\n\u201cOn the other side, they want to eat,\u201d said Ayed el-Sayah, a furniture maker in town, referring to Gaza. \u201cHere we want to eat, too. That\u2019s why we have the tunnels.\u201d\nThese are tense days in this shattered town of about 50,000 in the northeastern corner of Sinai. It has become the focus of an intense effort to stop smuggling activities, but the focus has been exclusively on security. Checkpoints have been set up, and the police often stop young men in cars and demand to see identification. The center of the town feels as if it is occupied.\nBut with every Israeli bomb just over the border, and with every increase in Egyptian security, there is less and less room for any kind of normal life. The streets are filled with idle young men, children and old men, all with nowhere to go and little to do. Women stay at home.\n\u201cWe only wish we didn\u2019t have to do this, that we had another job or a project, something else we can do,\u201d said a 22-year-old, who asked not to be identified for fear of being imprisoned for his work as a smuggler.\nThe young man graduated with a degree in commerce from the equivalent here of a junior college. He said he began working a tunnel only recently because there was nothing else for him to do to make a living, or to occupy his time.\nHe and a cousin, 19, who also is a smuggler, were huddled together in a new imported car, one of the fruits of the trade, parked outside a friend\u2019s house. It was a chilly desert night, the sky shocked with stars, and the young men were wired and nervous, smoking one cigarette after another.\nThe broad outlines of the tunnels are well known from the Gaza side. They are about 6 feet high and 3 feet wide. They are typically 65 feet or so below the surface, have pulley systems and lighting and ventilation. The Hamas government charges for the electricity used.\nLittle discussed is how the tunnels work on the Egyptian side, and why state security has been so unsuccessful in finding them. They are begun in Gaza in full view of Egypt\u2019s border guards, after all, and nearly everyone here admits to either working in the tunnels or being related to someone who is.\nThe young men say that most people no longer have the tunnels come up inside their homes, because if they are caught they have no room for denial, and the whole family could be imprisoned. The openings are lined with tarps and filled with sand. When the tunnel owner in Gaza wants to make a run, he phones and the young men assemble a small group of trusted partners. They then dig out the sand, pull out the plastic tarps and pass through food, clothing or whatever has been ordered.\n\u201cIt is a family affair, but not everyone knows where the hole is,\u201d said the 19-year-old. \u201cThere are only a very few people you can trust and rely on. You make a deal with four or five other guys and that\u2019s it, it stays between you.\u201d\nThe young men said that most tunnels also have a pipe running through, a couple of inches in diameter. They said the pipes were used to funnel fuel, mostly diesel, to Gaza. Even when Israeli bombs managed to damage the tunnel entrances, or cause a collapse, the pipes were often undamaged and the fuel smuggling went on uninterrupted. They said they did not know anyone who smuggled weapons \u2014 only food, fuel and clothing.\nThere was a time, more than a year ago, when smuggling was extremely lucrative, people here said. One bag of clothing could bring $200. But when the borders were closed after Hamas took control, the number of tunnels exploded from about 30 to between 200 and 300, according to residents here. With that, prices dropped, and that same bag of clothing came down to $80.\nWith the recent conflict, prices have risen again, because many tunnels are inoperable and because of the increased risk of getting caught or injured. Driving through Rafah at night, a friend of the smugglers, Ahmed, pointed to a convoy of white pickup trucks, all loaded with cans of fuel. \u201cThey are for the tunnels,\u201d he said, \u201call headed to Gaza.\u201d\nHow Ahmed \u2014 whose identity also is being hidden to protect him from arrest \u2014 could know that the trucks were smuggling fuel when security officials did not was not immediately clear. Ahmed introduced another friend, a smuggler, whose towering new home rose from the desert near Rafah, a mansion by local standards, and an absolute advertisement for his line of work.\nOn Thursday, the Obama administration\u2019s new Middle East envoy, George J. Mitchell, said that opening Gaza to commercial goods would help stamp out smuggling, of arms as well as goods. But Ahmed and his friends said that the authorities were reluctant to take measures to end the smuggling, of commodities at least.\nHow else, they asked, is anyone here going to make a decent living?\nFrom the rooftop, Mr. Sha\u2019er pointed to where Israeli planes bombed Gaza early Wednesday morning, flattening buildings, churning up huge mounds of sand. A few hours after the bombs fell, the people of Gaza were back at it, he said, trying to restore the tunnel openings. In Rafah many people said they were waiting for the call telling them their tunnel was working again and it was time to make another delivery.\n\u201cWe are farmers,\u201d Mr. Sha\u2019er said. \u201cBut we live off the tunnels.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/world/middleeast/30rafah.html", "title": "Where the Still Flourishing Underground Economy Is the Only Economy", "author": "MICHAEL SLACKMAN"}
{"date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "STRASBOURG, France \u2014 Michelle Obama\u2019s big moment finally arrived Friday morning, at the Palais Rohan, a mammoth baroque edifice here that has given shelter to Louis XV, Marie Antoinette and even Napoleon.\nAnd on Friday, it provided the backdrop for Mrs. Obama\u2019s equivalent of the Jackie-Kennedy-takes-Paris moment of 1961. No, Mrs. Obama didn\u2019t give a big speech or negotiate a tricky diplomatic incident. She went heel to heel with Carla Sarkozy.\nThere they were, currently the two most famous first ladies in the world, standing side by side \u2014 Mrs. Obama, of course, a few inches taller than Mrs. Sarkozy, but not towering over her as she had over Queen Elizabeth II. There they were, exchanging the first kiss-kiss, on both cheeks, the European way, clasping each other\u2019s hands, as the Sarkozys welcomed the Obamas to the palace, all to the soundtrack of the clacking of the paparazzi cameras. And there they were, striking identical demure poses, wearing identical bow ties on their coat-dresses, as their men strutted around the red-carpeted inner courtyard, this time to the soundtrack of \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d and \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d\nIn the four days of her first European trip as America\u2019s first lady, Mrs. Obama has hugged terminally ill cancer patients at a London hospital, chatted with the author J. K. Rowling over wild Scottish salmon and, her voice cracking with emotion, urged 200 well-behaved ethnically minority (for England) girls at a London school to aim high.\nBut none of that, not even the meeting with the queen, can come close to finally appearing in the same camera lens with the former Carla Bruni, an Italian-born singer and former Victoria\u2019s Secret model now dominating the French political-fashion scene. All of Europe had been speculating about why it was that Mrs. Sarkozy did not show up in London for the Group of 20 meeting on Thursday. The official explanation from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace was that she wanted some quiet time by herself.\nHmm. Maybe it was all of the comparison of the two women in the European media? Mrs. Sarkozy sparked \u201cCarla mania\u201d last year when she visited Britain as France\u2019s first lady, but the British press is fickle. \u201cCarla Bruni may have seduced every man she met last year, but this year Michelle Obama charmed us all,\u201d raved The Guardian in an article headlined, \u201cHow Britain was wooed by Michelle Obama.\u201d The Times of London was nastier. \u201cCarla who?\u201d it queried Thursday.\nCertainly, Mrs. Obama has done a fair amount of wooing so far. During her appearance at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School in London on Thursday, she sent girls into a frenzy just by showing up. \u201cNothing in my life\u2019s path would have predicted that I would be standing here as the first African-American first lady of the United States,\u201d she told them. When she started to tear up, the girls, responded, collectively, \u201cAwww.\u201d They treated her like a rock star, and Mrs. Obama responded in kind. After a rousing rendition of a song called, \u201cI\u2019m Going All the Way,\u201d which came with a funky groove, Mrs. Obama slapped the hand of the young soloist. The girl literally hopped with excitement.\nMrs. Obama even surprised \u2014 and discomfited \u2014 her Secret Service agents, when, after her speech at the school, she started hugging every girl in sight.\nDuring the dinner at 10 Downing Street with Ms. Rowling, of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fame, and Kelly Holmes, of Olympic gold running fame, Mrs. Obama received warm reviews, especially after she told everyone to call her Michelle. \u201cMichelle walks in and she is as she seems,\u201d Ms. Holmes told reporters afterward. \u201cSo warm, engaging, a beautiful lady \u2014 and I quickly got my photo in the middle of her and Sarah Brown,\u201d the wife of the British prime minister, Gordon Brown.\nIt is not exactly mastering nuclear physics to smile nicely, shake hands, and visit sick patients, the traditional job of a first lady. And Mrs. Obama has yet to stake out her own territory on a big do-gooding issue, \u00e0 la Angelina Jolie and African poverty, or even Mrs. Sarkozy, who recently signed on with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria as the fund\u2019s first formal celebrity envoy.\nEven the small blip in her performance, when she touched the queen in a breach of protocol, was declared a no-foul by a Buckingham Palace spokesman. And the British press raved about her clothes.\nStill, everyone knows that France is the fashion capital (although maybe not Strasbourg). Upon their arrival on Air Force One, the Obamas drove in a motorcade to the Palais Rohan for the meeting. Mr. Sarkozy was all bonhomie as he scampered around the Obamas, ushering them this way and that.\nPossibly realizing that she would be judged against a European fashion icon, Mrs. Obama, a Harvard-trained lawyer, brought her A game. Resplendent in a burgundy Thakoon coat and dress (her counterpart was in Dior), her hair coiffed into a bouffant that would have made Mrs. Kennedy proud, she stood toe-to-toe with Mrs. Sarkozy.\nAfterward, the two women retired inside the palace. \u201cThey had lunch together and a lively conversation,\u201d said Katie McCormick Lelyveld, an aide to Mrs. Obama. \u201cThey got along very well.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/world/europe/04michelle.html", "title": "A French Embrace for Mrs. Obama", "author": "HELENE COOPER"}
{"date": "Sat, 11 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CAPE COAST, Ghana \u2014 President Obama traveled in his father\u2019s often-troubled home continent on Saturday, where he symbolized a new political era but brought a message of tough love: American aid must be matched by Africa\u2019s responsibility for its own problems.\n\u201cWe must start from the simple premise that Africa\u2019s future is up to Africans,\u201d Mr. Obama said in an address televised across the continent. For all its previous sins, he said, \u201cthe West is not responsible for the destruction of the Zimbabwean economy over the last decade, or wars in which children are enlisted as combatants.\u201d\nTo build a prosperous future, he said, Africa needs to shed corruption and tyranny and take on poverty and disease.\n\u201cThese things can only be done if you take responsibility for your future,\u201d he told Parliament in Accra, Ghana\u2019s capital. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t be easy. It will take time and effort. There will be suffering and setbacks. But I can promise you this: America will be with you every step of the way, as a partner, as a friend.\u201d\nThe visit of the first African-American president, the son of a onetime Kenyan goat herder, electrified this small coastal nation and much of the region. Thousands of people lined streets, crowded rooftops, packed balconies, climbed trees, leaned out windows, even hung off scaffolding to glimpse his motorcade.\nHis face was everywhere, from billboards to T-shirts to dresses. His name and campaign theme became the refrains of songs played in his honor.\nHis one-day stop blended his vision of the future with echoes of the past. He stood in the Door of No Return at Cape Coast Castle, a notorious slave port perched on the windswept sea here where men who looked like him were once held in dungeons until they were marched in shackles to waiting ships. He brought his wife, Michelle, a descendant of slaves, and their daughters, Malia and Sasha.\nMr. Obama, rarely one to display emotion, seemed especially sober. He said the castle reminded him of the Buchenwald concentration camp and underscored the existence of \u201cpure evil\u201d in the world.\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a moving experience, a moving moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAs painful as it is, I think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that, sadly, still exist in our world.\u201d\nOne evil he came here to fight is the pernicious mix of greed, famine and war that has kept Africa down. He delivered a blunt message that from his predecessors might not have been received the same way. Instead, it was cast by aides as hard truths from a loving cousin.\n\u201cNo country is going to create wealth if its leaders exploit the economy to enrich themselves, or police can be bought off by drug traffickers,\u201d he said. \u201cNo business wants to invest in a place where the government skims 20 percent off the top, or the head of the port authority is corrupt. No person wants to live in a society where the rule of law gives way to the rule of brutality and bribery. That is not democracy, that is tyranny, and now is the time for it to end.\u201d\nMr. Obama added: \u201cAfrica doesn\u2019t need strongmen. It needs strong institutions.\u201d\nThe message of responsibility is one that he has conveyed to different audiences, from African-Americans at home to Muslims abroad. In Cairo last month, he said pointedly that even as America needed to better understand the Muslim world, Muslims needed to confront their own anti-American elements.\nAs in Cairo, he used personal history to soften stern language. \u201cAfter all,\u201d the president said, \u201cI have the blood of Africa within me, and my family\u2019s own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger African story. Some of you know my grandfather was a cook for the British in Kenya, and though he was a respected elder in his village, his employers called him boy for much of his life.\u201d\nMr. Obama\u2019s first trip to sub-Saharan Africa as president was his fourth to the continent that has played a distant yet central role in his life. When he first came as a college student, he had little more than a backpack and a train ticket. On Friday, he arrived on Air Force One.\nBut Mr. Obama\u2019s ties to Africa barely go beyond biography. He met his father only once as a child, and was raised largely by his white mother and grandparents. He has written about coming to terms with his biracial upbringing, neither a product of African-American culture nor a native son of Africa.\nDespite all the attention, the White House worked to keep his visit relatively low-key. A president accustomed to crowds of hundreds of thousands, Mr. Obama chose instead smaller venues, aware of the chaotic scene when hundreds of thousands of people nearly engulfed President Bill Clinton and injured one another during a 1998 visit.\nStill, the excitement was hard to miss. At a breakfast with dignitaries, Mr. Obama made his way down the center aisle with President John Atta Mills while a reggae artist, Blakk Rasta, crooned in the background: \u201cBarack, Barack, Barack Obama.\u201d\nAn announcer kept up a steady patter of commentary. \u201cThe first black president of the United States!\u201d he called out. \u201cAfrica meets one of its illustrious sons, Barack Obama.\u201d\nBefore his speech to Parliament, the legislators were chanting his old campaign slogan: \u201cYes we can! Yes we can!\u201d\nThen Mr. Atta Mills introduced Mr. Obama as a long-lost relative. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You\u2019re welcome,\u201d Ghana\u2019s president declared. \u201cYou\u2019ve come home.\u201d\nWith a functioning democracy that has managed several peaceful transitions of power, this nation of 23 million is the favorite American success story in sub-Saharan Africa. But the choice of Ghana illustrated how few models there are. Both Mr. Clinton and President George W. Bush came here too. By contrast, Mr. Obama bypassed his father\u2019s native Kenya, a reflection of the instability plaguing it recently.\nHis approach follows that of Mr. Bush, who was widely credited with doing more for Africa than any previous president. Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Bush tried to frame policy by rewarding good governance and building institutions through programs like the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an antipoverty effort that gave Ghana $547 million in 2006.\nEven Mr. Obama, who typically talks about the problems his administration inherited, said he was \u201cbuilding on the strong efforts of President Bush\u201d in Africa. Before flying here, Mr. Obama pressed the world\u2019s rich nations to pool $20 billion over three years to fight hunger, not only by delivering food, but also by teaching struggling farmers how to better grow crops.\nHe said little about what America would do for Africa, however, focusing instead on what Africa should do for itself.

{"date": "Wed, 24 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CAIRO \u2014 The rancorous dispute over Iran\u2019s presidential election could turn into a win-win for Arab leaders aligned with Washington who in the past have complained bitterly that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was destabilizing the region and meddling in Arab affairs, political analysts and former officials around the region said.\nThe good-news thinking goes like this: With Mr. Ahmadinejad remaining in office, there is less chance of substantially improved relations between Tehran and Washington, something America\u2019s Arab allies feared would undermine their interests. At the same time, the electoral conflict may have weakened Iran\u2019s leadership at home and abroad, forcing it to focus more on domestic stability, political analysts and former officials said.\n\u201cWhen Iran is strong and defiant they don\u2019t like her and when Iran is closer to the West they don\u2019t like her,\u201d said Adnan Abu Odeh, a former adviser to King Hussein of Jordan.\nOf course, such an outcome could also prove to be wishful thinking, political analysts cautioned. Other power centers in Iran, from the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to the military, can have more influence over regional policy than the president. It is also possible that a deeply divided leadership could aim to exacerbate regional tensions to distract attention from its domestic problems.\nThe Iranian standoff may also serve as a cautionary tale for Arab leaders who have watched as modern technology, like the Internet, social networking sites and cellphones, has yet again undermined the ability of authoritarian states to control access to and distribution of information.\nBut the cultural and social differences between Iran and Arab states are so great, there was no sense that leaders feared their citizens would be inspired to rise up. Iran is an important and influential nation in the Middle East, but it is also distant from the Sunni Arab street as a majority Persian country with a majority Shiite population.\n\u201cA lot of young people in the Arab world would love to see something like that, but the kind of civil society they have makes it much more natural for this to happen in Iran than in a place like Egypt or Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Ahmed al-Omran, a college student in Saudi Arabia and author of the popular blog saudijeans.org.\nMoreover, the dramatic video of Iranians being beaten or shot by Basijis has done incalculable damage to Iran\u2019s image as the region\u2019s most religiously pure and populist state. Iran\u2019s allies in the region, including Syria, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Hamas movement in the Palestinian territories, also seem likely to suffer a blow to their credibility, and perhaps to their financing, if the election crisis is resolved with heavy suppression or an extended standoff with the opposition, analysts said.\nOne gauge of how Arab leaders are reacting to the Iran crisis is their silence. Officials seem eager to avoid even the appearance that they are trying to influence the outcome, political analysts said. The state-controlled media outlets around the region have also been relatively low key in their coverage.\n\u201cWhen you are waiting so much for something that makes you happy, you hold your breath, you make less noise in order not to affect the outcome,\u201d said Randa Habib, a political analyst and columnist in Amman, Jordan.\nIran\u2019s allies, on the other hand, are restive. Emad Gad, an Egyptian expert in international affairs, said that he saw evidence of Iran\u2019s allies, especially in Syria, trying to hedge their bet on Tehran. He said that Syria had in recent days been more willing to help Egypt press for reconciliation between Palestinian factions.\n\u201cI think Ahmadinejad will concentrate in the economic field to improve living conditions for his population after this crisis,\u201d Mr. Gad said. \u201cThat means less giving money, less meddling, less penetration in the Arab world, less involvement.\u201d\nWhen the Iranian government first announced that Mr. Ahmadinejad had won a landslide victory, there was a collective sigh of regret among Arab leaders aligned with Washington. They had hoped that the reform candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi, would win, but they instead ended up \u2014 it appeared \u2014 with an emboldened incumbent. So it is with a bit of surprise, indeed disbelief and no shortage of cheer, that events may yet turn out even better than if Mr. Moussavi had won, political analysts said.\n\u201cThe Arab leaders are watching and they are very pleased,\u201d Mr. Gad said. \u201cThe Ahmadinejad after this election will be very different than the Ahmadinejad before this election. He will be weaker.\u201d\nThere is, analysts acknowledged, a potentially darker sequence of events that could emerge \u2014 one where Mr. Ahmadinejad comes out of this crisis even less concerned about domestic opinion than before and more aggressive. Analysts said that could prove difficult for him, though, because of deep splits that the conflict has already caused among the political elite.\nThe Arab governments aligned with Washington are part of a camp that has promoted an Arab peace initiative with Israel. Iran, they have charged, has worked to undermine the peace process by financing Hamas and Hezbollah and by attacking those in the peace camp. Before the elections, Iran was increasingly flexing its geopolitical muscles, often in disputes with its much smaller Arab neighbors in the Persian Gulf region. A former Iranian speaker of Parliament, for example, said that Bahrain was historically part of Iran.\nNow, Arab leaders are looking to regain the momentum and slow Iran\u2019s spreading power and influence, analysts said. They are also looking to use the crisis in Iran to undermine political Islam in general. The Arab world is ruled by authoritarian leaders, kings and emirs \u2014 and its greatest challenge to legitimacy and control is political Islamic movements like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Jordan.\n\u201cOpponents of the Islamist movement go far in anticipating the collapse of the Islamic revolution and the end of the Islamist movements and their political project,\u201d said Mohammad Abu Rumman, research editor at the newspaper Al Ghad in Amman. \u201cAnticipating the failure of the revolution is an anticipation of the failure of political Islam in general.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/world/middleeast/25arabs.html", "title": "Arab States Aligned With U.S. Savor Turmoil in Iran", "author": "MICHAEL SLACKMAN"}
{"date": "Sat, 11 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 One of Iran\u2019s most senior clerics issued an unusual decree on Saturday calling the country\u2019s rulers \u201cusurpers and transgressors\u201d for their treatment of opposition protesters in recent weeks, in the strongest condemnation by a religious figure since the contested presidential election a month ago.\nThe decree by Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, a dissident who has often criticized Iran\u2019s ruling clerics, did not mention by name Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but was clearly aimed at the clerical leadership.\nPosted on the Web site of Mohsen Kadivar, a dissident cleric and former student of Ayatollah Montazeri, the ruling said the recent arrests and shootings of protesters were proof that Iran\u2019s leaders are unqualified to rule the community of Muslims.\n\u201cIn my estimate this is the strongest criticism ever of the supreme leader,\u201d said Rasool Nafisi, a United States-based academic and Iran expert. \u201cAlthough it doesn\u2019t mention Ayatollah Khamenei by name, it is clear he is referring to him.\u201d\nIt is unlikely that the decree, or fatwa, will have any immediate effect in Iran, where opposition figures have already made their positions clear. Some prominent clerics, including Ayatollah Montazeri, have joined political figures in criticizing the government crackdown on street protests in recent weeks, and have said that they believed the election was rigged.\nBut mostly they have done so in cautious terms. None have made sweeping attacks on the government\u2019s credentials like the one issued Saturday.\n\u201cIt will have a much stronger effect if other senior clerics, who have also felt the danger, join Montazeri and issue these kinds of statements,\u201d said one political analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \u201cBut it will not become mainstream as long as only an individual cleric uses such strong terms.\u201d\nAlthough Ayatollah Montazeri has long been known as a critic of the government, his opinions have weight because of his seniority in Iran\u2019s religious establishment, and because he was a key proponent of wilayat faqih, or rule by clerics \u2014 the theoretical underpinning of Iran\u2019s theocracy.\nAyatollah Montazeri, 87, was a leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran and was once designated the successor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. But he fell out with Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989 over the execution of a large group of prisoners and other policies he deemed unjust.\nThe ruling came as news agencies reported that Iran\u2019s foreign minister announced that the government was preparing a new package of \u201cpolitical, security and international\u201d issues to put to the West. The minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said at a news conference that \u201cthe package can be a good basis for talks with the West,\u201d Reuters reported.\nMr. Mottaki\u2019s statement was Iran\u2019s first response to comments on Wednesday by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Italy, where he said the major powers would give Iran until September to accept negotiations over its nuclear program or face tougher sanctions. President Obama echoed that warning on Friday.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/world/asia/12iran.html", "title": "Senior Cleric Says Leaders of Iran Are Unfit to Rule", "author": "ROBERT F.

{"date": "Wed, 20 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "RAMALLAH, West Bank \u2014 There is the Central Committee and the Revolutionary Council, the Old Guard and the Young Guard. There are the insiders, the outsiders, the cell leaders, branch chiefs and district heads. And there is the Office of Mobilization and Discipline, also known as the Office of Indoctrination.\nFatah, the core of the Palestinian national movement for five decades, has the organizational transparency of a Soviet republic and was long run like one by its founder, Yasir Arafat. Talk of reform arose after his death five years ago and again when Hamas defeated it in legislative elections in 2006.\nBut shock after shock has done little to induce change. The movement has been paralyzed by competing personal alliances and a continuing identity crisis, and has not held a congress in 20 years. While the gap between the Fatah-led West Bank and the Hamas-led Gaza is widely recognized, less appreciated is that Fatah itself, which the West trains and helps, is so internally torn that it is scarcely able to negotiate or govern.\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Salam Fayyad announced a new government with greater Fatah representation among the ministers but little change in policy.\n\u201cWe are on a sinking ship, and the leadership thinks it can save us by plugging a hole,\u201d lamented Qaddoura Fares, a leading Fatah advocate of change and peace with Israel. \u201cWe have to wake up and stop lying to ourselves. We call ourselves a democratic movement, but what democratic movement hasn\u2019t met in 20 years?\u201d\nIf he and others succeed and Fatah reorganizes itself and successfully takes on Hamas in elections planned for 2010 in the West Bank and Gaza, prospects for a deal between Israel and a future state of Palestine could brighten considerably. But polls show that if elections were held now, Hamas would give Fatah a very close race.\n\u201cFatah used to be a movement focused on armed struggle, but now we want to be an economic and social movement with good government that ends corruption and promotes democracy,\u201d said Bassam Walweel, a political activist-turned-businessman who is also playing a role in trying to reshape the group. \u201cWe are committed to peace with Israel.\u201d\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization has long been dominated by Fatah and includes some smaller factions. Hamas was created in the late 1980s and is not part of the P.L.O. But since taking the 2006 elections, it has become the rising force in Palestinian politics, prompting Fatah to think about reform. After a four-day battle in June of 2007, Hamas took over Gaza, and Fatah was left with the West Bank.\nIn the past year, each of 14 West Bank regions has elected a new Fatah chief, most of whom are college-educated and professionally engaged. They meet weekly and rotate the leadership to avoid power plays. In addition, Fatah has taken a lesson from Hamas, seeking to make an impact at a grass-roots level by opening a 24-hour satellite television station and providing free lunches and book bags for needy schoolchildren.\nWhile most analysts and Fatah activists remain pessimistic that real change will occur soon, the continuing ferment for reform within is unmistakable.\nNearly every day in past weeks, Fatah activists have discussed ways to bring about the long-postponed congress aimed at producing new governing bodies and a fresh set of procedural and policy guidelines. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is the head of Fatah, has promised activists that he would hold the congress on July 1 in the West Bank. Most predict that the deadline will be missed, but also agree that a congress is needed.\n\u201cIt is highly unlikely that the congress can be postponed for long,\u201d said Khalil Shikaki, a Ramallah-based political scientist and pollster. \u201cIt has to happen this year to prevent the Young Guard from revolting.\u201d\nEvery element of the congress is a source of division \u2014 who attends, as well as when and where it should be held and what should be decided.\nThe new political activists, from within the West Bank and Gaza, want the number of delegates to run into the thousands, so that the aging leaders can be pushed aside. Many are hoping to elect Marwan Barghouti, who is in an Israeli prison, as the new leader. The membership committee, however, wants only 650 to be invited. Mr. Abbas has said the number should be around 1,500.\nTo hold the meeting in the West Bank, as Mr. Abbas wants, would be to strengthen the insiders, those in the West Bank and Gaza, as opposed to the outsiders, those living in places like Lebanon and Syria. But a West Bank venue also means that Israel, which controls the borders with the West Bank, would have veto power over which outsiders could come.\nThis poses a delicate dilemma for Israel. While it might in theory favor a strengthened and renewed Fatah as a future negotiating partner and Palestinian government, such an organization could also be more militant. It would also have to decide what to do about Mr. Barghouti if he were elected.\nMany of the younger activists say that the men around Mr. Abbas are mistaken to take armed struggle off the table, especially after Israel\u2019s attack on Gaza in January. At the same time, they say that if a deal were struck, they are the ones who could sell it to the street and make it stick.\n\u201cThe current leadership doesn\u2019t keep armed struggle as an option,\u201d said Dimitri Y. Diliani, the Fatah spokesman for the Jerusalem area. \u201cFor us on the ground, we are in favor of political discourse to pursue national goals. But in case it doesn\u2019t work in a certain time frame we should resort to other options, including armed resistance.\u201d\nIf the congress were held in Egypt or Jordan, the authorities there could have undue influence over who attended and what was concluded.\nThe biggest question for Fatah is what exactly it stands for: whether to push for a unity government with Hamas or seek to defeat it; whether to accept compromise with Israel on issues like the Palestinian right of return, the borders of the new state and the status of Jerusalem.\nFor Israel and the United States, the problem is equally vexing. They have an interest in helping the nationalists to reform and hold their congress. But they also have to decide how much to help the new leaders, some of whom may end up becoming opponents if the peace negotiating process fails.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/middleeast/21palestinians.html", "title": "Palestinians Try to Prune Branches of Core Party", "author": "ETHAN BRONNER"}
{"date": "Mon, 26 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BERLIN \u2014 Iceland\u2019s coalition government collapsed Monday, the latest fallout from a global financial crisis that has set off angry demonstrations against governments across Europe.\nPrime Minister Geir Haarde said he was unwilling to meet the demands of his coalition partners, the Social Democratic Alliance Party, which had insisted upon getting the post of prime minister to keep the coalition intact, The Associated Press reported from Reykjavik, the Icelandic capital.\nLast week, Mr. Haarde called elections for May, bringing forward a vote originally scheduled for 2011, after weeks of protests by Icelanders angered by soaring unemployment and rising prices. But Mr. Haarde said he would not lead his Independence Party into the new elections because he needed treatment for cancer.\nIceland has been in crisis since the collapse of its banks because of large debt in September and October, with its currency, the krona, plummeting. The government has negotiated $10 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund and other countries, but the standard of living for the average person has sunk along with the currency, and the economy is expected to contract by nearly 10 percent this year.\nThe country\u2019s commerce minister, Bjorgvin Sigurdsson, quit Sunday, citing the pressures of the economic collapse, The A.P. reported.\nThe demonstrations in Iceland, which have also demanded the resignation of the governor of the nation\u2019s central bank, have been mirrored elsewhere in Europe.\nThe Latvian government, which this month pushed through wage and spending cuts but also tax increases in order to cope with the banking crisis, faced demonstrations that turned into violent riots. Neighboring Lithuania also had to contend with protesters after the government introduced a package of austerity measures to protect the financial sector.\nTens of thousands turned out in the Spanish city of Zaragoza last week to press the local authorities to deal with soaring unemployment as the country\u2019s construction and retailing industries are hit by the global downturn. And in Greece, the government is still coming to terms with widespread student protests.\nIn all cases, the demonstrations have had a mix of sentiments: anti-globalization, anti-capitalist and anti-reform.\nSo far, Europe\u2019s largest economies, France, Germany and Britain, have been spared demonstrations. All three governments have introduced huge stimulus measures aimed at spurring employment and protecting banks.\nRegardless of the outcome, the three countries will face large budget deficits and higher state borrowing, which economists say will be passed on to taxpayers. And in the case of France and Germany, the governments could find it more difficult to introduce bold reforms in a time of recession.\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who had advocated strong state intervention to protect his country against recession, recently postponed revamping the high school curriculum, which had been the target of weeks of student protests. Already, Mr. Sarkozy is dealing with another round of trade union strikes, which are scheduled to start Thursday, to protest unemployment.\nIn Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government recently pushed through a batch of stimulus measures worth about $105 billion. The measures are aimed at curbing unemployment by providing public money for roads, schools and consumer car-loan incentives.\nBut with many German companies already hit by the global slowdown and desperate to introduce savings and keep wages down, strikes cannot be ruled out. Lufthansa, the profitable national airline, is already facing strike warnings, with its union demanding pay raises of more than 10 percent.\nStill, despite the tens of thousands of workers who have been put on shorter working weeks, the Merkel government has not yet faced huge anti-capitalist demonstrations.\nInstead, Germany\u2019s leftist parties, fighting bitterly among themselves to gain political mileage during an election year, are heaping blame on bankers, not the regulatory processes, for the financial crisis.\nIn Iceland, Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Gisladottir, head of the Social Democratic Alliance Party, is expected to start talks immediately with opposition parties in an attempt to form a new government that would rule until the new elections are held, The A.P reported.\nMs. Gisladottir said Monday that she would not seek to become Iceland\u2019s new prime minister, proposing instead another member of her party, Social Affairs Minister Johanna Siguroardottir.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/world/europe/27iceland.html", "title": "Iceland\u2019s Government Collapses", "author": "JUDY DEMPSEY"}

{"date": "Wed, 22 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "An international tribunal redefined the borders of a disputed oil-rich region between north and south Sudan on Wednesday. The ruling seeks to defuse a thorny issue in the 2005 peace agreement ending one of Africa\u2019s longest civil wars by splitting the contested zone between the two sides.\nIn its ruling, the tribunal, seated at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, overruled a decision by an international commission that Sudan\u2019s government rejected four years ago.\nThe new ruling includes important concessions for both sides, giving the government in the north control of the region\u2019s richest oil fields, but consolidating control of the remaining region under the Ngok Dinka, an ethnic group loyal to southern Sudan and likely to vote to join it in a coming referendum.\nBoth sides in the conflict \u2014 President Omar Hassan al-Bashir\u2019s government in the north, and the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement, which controls the semiautonomous south \u2014 said Wednesday that they would accept the ruling, which was hailed by representatives of the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.\n\u201cBoth parties have agreed that this question is now settled,\u201d the United Nations special representative in Sudan, Ashraf Qazi, said Wednesday in a statement from the contested region, known as Abyei.\nThe ruling removes a major roadblock to a 2011 referendum on self-determination for the south, the final stage of a six-year peace agreement that stopped the war between the north and the south in 2005, after more than two decades of fighting.\nRedrawing the borders of the region, the ruling gives the north uncontested rights to rich oil deposits like the Heglig oil field, which had previously been placed within Abyei.\nBut the decision leaves at least one oil field in Abyei and gives a symbolic victory to the Ngok Dinka, affirming their claims to the heartland of the fertile region.\n\u201cWho controls Abyei has taken on a symbolic importance beyond the traditional tensions over oil,\u201d said Colin Thomas-Jensen, an analyst on Sudan with the Enough Project, a group that aims to stop genocide. \u201cIf the two sides can\u2019t make Abyei work, the risk rises that the north and south will go back to war.\u201d\nThe largely Muslim Arab north and the largely Christian and animist south have fought two civil wars since Sudan\u2019s independence in 1956, the most recent lasting more than 20 years. An estimated two million people were killed and some four million displaced in the two decades before the 2005 treaty.\nAbyei became a microcosm of the larger issues dividing the north and the south. Two sets of ethnic groups \u2014 the Muslim Arab Misseriya loyal to the government, and the largely animist and Christian Ngok Dinka \u2014 live in the area. It is rich in oil and sits on the border between the north and the south, an area with many other places that remain under contention and were not settled by Wednesday\u2019s ruling.\nRecent disputes over the region led to a May 2008 battle in which most of the town of Abyei was burned to the ground and 50,000 residents were forced to flee. After that flare-up, the north and the south agreed to bring the question of Abyei\u2019s borders to the arbitration panel in The Hague.\nBy tightening the borders of Abyei and effectively placing many of its Misseriya Arab residents in northern territory, the ruling makes it far more likely that the region will vote to join southern Sudan in a 2011 referendum on its final status, experts said. In a separate referendum, the south will vote on whether to secede from Sudan.\nExperts warned that serious issues remained in enforcing Wednesday\u2019s decision. For now, the border remains a straight line on a map, and the hard work of cutting across grazing lands and other holdings must begin.\n\u201cIn principle, the ruling makes both sides relatively happy, but we don\u2019t know what will happen with the implementation,\u201d said Fabienne Hara, a vice president at the International Crisis Group.\nUntil the 2011 referendum on self-determination, Abyei will formally remain a part of northern Sudan, presenting security concerns for ethnic groups loyal to the south. Renewed violence is a possibility. \u201cThe U.N. has to step up and demonstrate that they can keep the peace,\u201d said Mr. Thomas-Jensen, the analyst on Sudan.\nThe United States and the European Union issued a joint statement urging both sides to follow the ruling immediately: \u201cBoth parties must use their authority and influence to ensure that the court\u2019s decision is respected and peacefully implemented.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/world/africa/23sudan.html", "title": "Court Redraws Disputed Area in Sudan", "author": "SHARON OTTERMAN"}

Filing cabinets lay where they crashed to the ground the night before, while office papers were tangled in the boughs of pine trees.\nRuslan Grosu, 21, stood outside, trying to make sense of it.\n\u201cA little revolution happened here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is this power in our youth, and they should respect our wishes.\u201d But from inside the building came the bleak sound of workers knocking out broken windows, and Mr. Grosu felt compelled to add this: \u201cAlmost all of us think it is bad and evil, what happened here.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not thieves,\u201d he said.\nA day after a huge anti-Communist rally turned violent in Chisinau, Moldova\u2019s capital, everyone was speculating about who was behind it.\nPresident Vladimir Voronin said the event had been planned by Romanians, and called for the Romanian ambassador to leave within 24 hours. Youth activists charged that opposition parties had hijacked an otherwise peaceful crowd for their own purposes. And the opposition leader Vlad Filat said authorities had allowed the protests to get out of hand in order to portray the president\u2019s challengers as extremists.\nBut Dumitru Minzarari, a political analyst, thought the best answer was the simplest one.\n\u201cIt was a spontaneous event,\u201d said Mr. Minzarari, who works at the Institute for Development and Social Initiatives, a policy research organization here. \u201cThe real reason behind this was that young people just revolted. These are not Soviet-educated people who are submissive and afraid to get into the streets.\u201d\nNobody was killed in Tuesday\u2019s violence, but 118 police officers needed medical assistance and 43 of them were hospitalized, said Alla Meleka, a spokeswoman for the Moldovan Interior Ministry. The city ambulance service reported that 79 civilians received medical care and that 14 of them were hospitalized.\nCrowds gathered again on Wednesday in the city\u2019s main square, but it was a chastened group of around 1,000, a fraction of the 10,000 to 15,000 estimated on Tuesday. During Tuesday\u2019s protests, 193 people were arrested, Ms. Meleka said. Moldova\u2019s Prosecutor General\u2019s Office announced that it would investigate each case and pursue criminal charges against organizers.\nThe half dozen young activists who enlisted Twitter, Facebook and text messages to organize a \u201cflash mob\u201d on Monday have withdrawn from the protests entirely. In an interview, one activist, Natalia Morar, 25, said that she expected to face charges, and that she and other organizers had received phone calls that were \u201cnot so much threats as warnings that we will be in very big danger during the next few days.\u201d\nWhat bothers her the most, she said, is the suggestion that she and her friends somehow contributed to the violence, which she watched on television. \u201cBelieve me, there is nothing at all enjoyable about it,\u201d she said.\nThe protests have exposed a split in Moldova, the first post-Soviet state to vote Communists back into power. Mr. Voronin was elected president in 2001 on a wave of deep disappointment that the Soviet collapse had brought Moldova little but poverty, corruption and civil war.\nMr. Voronin, who once led the Moldovan K.G.B., won re-election in 2005 pledging to renew relations with Europe and strengthen democratic institutions. But many of his opponents saw his commitments as hollow.\nMany of the young see Romania, a European Union member just southwest of Moldova, as a symbol of promise. There have been short-lived movements to unite the countries, which were one from 1918 to 1940.

{"date": "Wed, 05 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Bill Clinton arrived in the United States Wednesday morning after a dramatic 20-hour visit to North Korea, in which he won the freedom of two American journalists, opened a diplomatic channel to North Korea\u2019s reclusive government and dined with the North\u2019s ailing leader, Kim Jong-il.\nThe private plane carrying Mr. Clinton and the journalists, Laura Ling, 32, and Euna Lee, 36, landed at 5:50 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, just outside Los Angeles.\nThe two women stepped off the plane in jeans and sweaters, rushing down the stairs to be reunited with their families, who clustered around them. Ms. Lee, in tears, embraced her husband, Michael Saldate, and knelt to hug her 4-year-old daughter, Hana. Ms. Ling kissed her husband, Iain Clayton. Mr. Clinton stepped off the plane a few moments later, embracing former Vice President Al Gore, the founder of the media company that employs the journalists.\n\u201cThirty hours ago, Euna Lee and I were prisoners in North Korea,\u201d Ms. Ling said in brief remarks to reporters, blinking back tears. \u201cWe feared that at any moment we could be prisoners in a hard labor camp. Then suddenly we were told that we were going to a meeting.\n\u201cWe were taken to a location and when we walked through the doors, we saw standing before us President Bill Clinton,\u201d she said, recounting the final moments of her ordeal. \u201cWe were shocked, but we knew instantly in our hearts that the nightmare of our lives was finally coming to an end. And now we stand here home and free.\u201d\nMr. Gore then spoke. \u201cPresident Obama and countless members of his administration have been deeply involved,\u201d in the effort to bring the women home, he said. \u201cTo everybody who has played a part in this,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are so grateful.\u201d\nThe North Korean government, which in June sentenced the women to 12 years of hard labor for illegally entering North Korean territory, announced hours before the jet\u2019s departure from North Korea that it had pardoned the women after Mr. Clinton apologized to Mr. Kim for their actions, according to the North Korean state media.\nMr. Clinton\u2019s wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, said Wednesday that the administration was \u201cextremely excited\u201d that the women would be reunited with their families. But she denied that her husband had apologized.\nPresident Obama, who contacted the families of the women on Tuesday evening, said that he, too, was \u201cextraordinarily relieved\u201d at the journalists\u2019 return.\n\u201cI want to thank President Bill Clinton \u2014 I had a chance to talk to him \u2014 for the extraordinary humanitarian effort that resulted in the release of the two journalists,\u201d Mr. Obama said outside the White House on Wednesday morning.\nMr. Clinton\u2019s mission to Pyongyang was the most visible by an American in nearly a decade. It came at a time when the United States\u2019 relationship with North Korea had become especially chilled, after North Korea\u2019s test of its second nuclear device in May and a series of missile launchings.\nIt ended a harrowing ordeal for the two women, who were stopped on March 17 by soldiers near North Korea\u2019s border with China while researching a report about women and human trafficking. They faced years of imprisonment in the gulag-like confines of a North Korean prison camp.\nAnd it catapulted Mr. Clinton back on to the global stage, on behalf of a president who defeated Mrs. Clinton in a bitter primary campaign last year, and who later asked her to be his secretary of state.\nMrs. Clinton was deeply involved in the case, too. She proposed sending various people to Pyongyang \u2014 including Mr. Gore \u2014 to lobby for the release of the women, before Mr. Clinton emerged as the preferred choice of the North Koreans, people briefed on the talks said.\nAbout 10 days ago, these people said, Mr. Gore called Mr. Clinton to ask him to undertake the trip. Mr. Clinton agreed, as long as the Obama administration did not object.\nIn an interview Wednesday with NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show in Nairobi, Kenya, Mrs. Clinton said the final request to Mr. Clinton had come from the White House.\n\u201cWhen the message came to us from the young women themselves, to their families, to former Vice President Gore, and then to the administration that sending my husband would be the best way to ensure their release, of course we took that very seriously, discussed it,\u201d she said, according to a transcript. \u201cThe White House reached out, as they said, to my husband, to ask him if he would be willing to do that.\u201d\nThe riveting tableau, of a former president jetting into a diplomatic crisis while his wife was embarking on a tour of Africa in her role as the nation\u2019s chief diplomat, underscored the unique and enduring role of the Clintons, even in the Obama era.\nAt a news conference in Nairobi on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said the case of the captured Americans had been handled separately from America\u2019s dispute with North Korea over its nuclear program.\n\u201cWe have been working hard on the release of the two journalists, and we have always considered that a separate issue,\u201d she said. The future of the United States\u2019 relationship with Pyongyang, she continued, was \u201creally up to them.\u201d\nMr. Clinton\u2019s trip to Pyongyang came just two weeks after North Korea issued a harsh personal attack on Mrs. Clinton, in response to comments she made comparing its nuclear test and missile launchings to the behavior of an attention-seeking teenager.\nThe North Korean Foreign Ministry objected to her \u201cvulgar remarks\u201d and called her \u201ca funny lady\u201d who was neither intelligent nor diplomatic. \u201cSometimes she looks like a primary-school girl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,\u201d a spokesman said.\nThe episode evidently did not stop consideration of sending her husband as an envoy. But the initiative was cloaked in secrecy and came after weeks of back-channel talks between the United States and North Korea through its United Nations mission. In addition to Mr. Gore, the White House\u2019s list of potential candidates included Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico.\nNorth Korea signaled its desire to have Mr. Clinton act as a special envoy in conversations with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, who relayed that message to their families in the middle of July, according to a senior administration official. The message was passed to Mr. Gore, who contacted the White House, which then explored whether such a mission would be successful.\nMr. Obama did not speak directly with Mr. Clinton before the mission. But his national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, contacted the former president to sound him out. The senior official said the administration did \u201cdue diligence\u201d with the North Koreans to ensure that if Mr. Clinton went, he would return with the journalists.\nAs president, Mr. Clinton had sent Mr. Kim a letter of condolence on the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, according to a former official. For Mr. Kim, the former official said, freeing the women was a \u201creciprocal humanitarian gesture.\u201d\nMr. Kim is believed to have suffered a stroke last year. American officials said they thought his declining health had set off a succession struggle, complicating the Obama administration\u2019s dealings with the North.\nThe families of the American journalists issued a statement saying they were \u201coverjoyed\u201d by news of the pardon and thanked Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission and Vice President Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home,\u201d the statement said.\nCurrent TV said in a statement that it was also \u201coverjoyed\u201d and that the hearts of its employees went out to Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee for \u201cpersevering through this horrible experience.\u201d\nMr. Clinton and the journalists traveled on a private jet owned by Stephen Bing, a real estate heir and a major Democratic Party contributor, who donated the use of the jet as a favor, said Andy Meyers, the chief executive officer of Shangri-la Industries, which was founded by Mr. Bing.\nAdministration officials said Mr. Clinton went to North Korea as a private citizen, did not carry a message from Mr. Obama for Mr. Kim and had the authority to negotiate only for the women\u2019s release.\n\u201cThis was 100 percent about the journalists,\u201d said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. \u201cWe knew Kim Jong-il would probably seek a meeting with Clinton. But that\u2019s not what this visit was about.\u201d\nStill, North Korea, clearly seeing a propaganda opportunity at home and a rare chance for a measure of favorable publicity abroad, welcomed Mr. Clinton with the fanfare of a state visit. It broadcast a group portrait, as well as photos of Mr. Kim gesturing and talking to Mr. Clinton; of the former president accepting flowers from a North Korean girl; and of Mr. Clinton, seated across a negotiating table from Mr. Kim, each flanked by aides. Among those greeting Mr. Clinton at the airport was Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator.\nAmong those accompanying Mr. Clinton was David Straub, a former director of the Korea desk at the State Department, who had held talks with the North Koreans through what is known as the \u201cNew York connection.\u201d\nAlso on hand was John Podesta, an informal adviser to the Obama administration who served as Mr. Clinton\u2019s chief of staff in the final years of his presidency, when the former president yearned to travel to North Korea to clinch a deal that would have curbed its nuclear program.\nThat visit never happened \u2014 partly because the White House concluded that a deal was not assured \u2014 and former President George W. Bush put the brakes on direct talks with North Korea, setting the stage for eight years of largely fruitless efforts to stop the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\nGiven Mr. Clinton\u2019s stature and his long interest in the North Korean nuclear issue, experts said it was likely that his discussions in North Korea ranged well beyond obtaining the release of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee.\n\u201cIt would be someplace between surprising and shocking if there wasn\u2019t some substantive discussion between the former president, who is deeply knowledgeable about the nuclear issue, and Kim Jong-il,\u201d said Robert L. Gallucci, who negotiated with North Korea in the Clinton administration.\nMr. Clinton has sought to find the right place in the Obama era, eager to play a role without stepping on the toes of the new president or, certainly, the secretary of state.\nThe last time the two had spoken, said the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was in March, when Mr. Obama invited Mr. Clinton to a ceremony in Washington for signing legislation expanding the AmeriCorps program created by Mr. Clinton.\nIn interviews last spring, Mr. Clinton said that he would be happy to do anything Mr. Obama asked him to do, but that \u201cI try to stay out of their way.\u201d\nMr. Clinton\u2019s mission may be less of an issue for Mr. Obama than for Mrs. Clinton. The same day he landed in North Korea, she arrived in Kenya, beginning an 11-day journey through Africa \u2014 a visit now largely eclipsed by her husband\u2019s travels.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/world/asia/06korea.html", "title": "Bill Clinton and Journalists in Emotional Return to U.S.", "author": "MARK LANDLER and PETER BAKER"}
{"date": "Fri, 13 Nov 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "TOKYO \u2014 President Obama, seeking to mend fences with Japan, America\u2019s most important Asian ally, announced Friday that he would establish a high-level working group on the contentious issue of the continuing presence of a Marine base on Okinawa.\nThe decision, announced at a news conference with Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama just hours after he touched down in Tokyo to begin his first presidential trip to Asia, appears to represent a concession by the Obama administration to at least consider Japan\u2019s concerns about the base, which is unpopular on Okinawa and which the new Japanese government had promised to try to move off the island.\nLess than a month ago, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates seemed to shut the door on renegotiating a deal reached in 2006 to relocate the United States Marine air station in Futenma to a less populated part of Okinawa.\nMr. Obama was, in effect, making a political gift to Mr. Hatoyama: seeming to reopen a door Mr. Gates had shut, even though Japan policy experts indicated that the establishment of the working group was most likely only a face-saving way for the new prime minister to show the Japanese public that he was keeping a campaign promise.\nMr. Obama\u2019s visit comes at a time when relationships between the two allies have hit their lowest point in years and Mr. Hatoyama searches for a more \u201cequal partnership.\u201d On Friday, both leaders emphasized the importance of the relationship, and stressed that the two sides were seeing eye to eye.\nStanding beside Mr. Obama at the Japanese equivalent of the White House, the Kantei, Mr. Hatoyama said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to call each other Barack and Yukio, and gotten quite accustomed to calling each other by our names.\u201d\nWhite House officials said that the United States had agreed only to talks \u201con the implementation\u201d of the 2006 Okinawa agreement, and said they did not expect to alter the larger shape of the agreement, which also calls for relocating about 8,000 Marines to Guam.\n\u201cIt is a fact that we did campaign on this issue, and the Okinawans do have high expectations,\u201d Mr. Hatoyama said, explaining why he was intent on reopening the subject.\nThe United States also appeared to give ground on the other security point of dispute, accepting Mr. Hatoyama\u2019s pledge of $5 billion in aid to Afghanistan, which the prime minister linked to his government\u2019s decision to end the Japanese Navy\u2019s refueling mission near Afghanistan.\nMr. Obama said the promise \u201cunderscores Japan\u2019s prominent role\u201d in the international effort in Afghanistan.\nStill, there have been ample signs that the half-century alliance may be entering a new phase. Recently, squabbles between the United States and Japan have focused mostly on trade disputes over luxury cars and semiconductors, while the security alliance between the two remained stable.\nNow, the conflicts have shifted to security, more specifically, on the Marine bases on Okinawa, the southern island that is home to about two-thirds of the 37,000 shore-based United States military personnel in Japan. Okinawans have said that they shoulder a disproportionate burden, and simmering resentments erupted in 1995 after the rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl by three American servicemen.\nIn 2006 the United States agreed to rebase thousands of soldiers to Guam, and to move the Marine base at Futenma elsewhere on Okinawa. But Mr. Hatoyama campaigned for office on a pledge to move the airfield off Okinawa altogether.\nPolitical analysts and the Japanese news media now speak of a communication gap opening between Washington and Tokyo, which has led to what they call excessive American concerns that Japan may try to alter the two nations\u2019 postwar military alliance.\nThese analysts say that the two nations are actually much closer on bilateral issues than they realize, and that Japan cannot afford to alienate a protector upon whom it still relies for its security as it faces a fast-rising China and a nuclear-armed North Korea. But they say relations have fallen into a vicious cycle in which Tokyo sends conflicting signals, and Washington makes matters worse by raising public pressure.\nYasunori Sone, a professor of political and policy analysis at Keio University in Tokyo, said of the Japanese leaders: \u201cThere are too many places where we don\u2019t know what the new government really wants. Their public relations has been poor.\u201d\nAt the same time, the experts also blame the Obama administration for overreacting to what they say is essentially language aimed at a domestic audience and for failing to see that Tokyo\u2019s government has little stomach for big changes to the alliance.\nJapanese officials, in Washington last month to prepare for Mr. Obama\u2019s trip, asked their American counterparts and foreign policy experts to give the new Japanese government time to get its house in order.\nThe American frustration over the Hatoyama government\u2019s refusal to back down from the campaign pledges on the Okinawa base came to a head when Mr. Gates visited Tokyo in October. Mr. Gates, known for speaking bluntly, pressed Mr. Hatoyama and Japanese military officials to keep their commitment on the military agreements.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to move on,\u201d Mr. Gates said, calling Japanese proposals to reopen the base issue \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d Then, adding insult to injury in the eyes of Japanese commentators, Mr. Gates turned down invitations to attend a welcoming ceremony at the Defense Ministry and to dine with officials there.\nMr. Obama will try to make up for some of the ensuing upset.

The question now is whether his administration\u2019s support for the presidential election being held there on Sunday will be seen as a stamp of approval for a coup or, as senior administration members maintain, the beginning of the end of the crisis.\nMost countries in the region see it as the former. Haunted by ghosts of authoritarian governments not long in the grave, countries like Brazil, Argentina and Chile have argued that an election held by an illegal government is, by definition, illegal.\nThey worry that if Mr. Obama appears to set aside that principle in Honduras, where the United States has long been a power broker, what would Washington do if democracy were threatened in a more powerful country where it wields less influence?\nLast week, Marco Aur\u00e9lio Garc\u00eda, a senior adviser to the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said his country \u201ccontinues to have great hopes\u201d for good relations with the United States. But, he added, \u201cthe truth is so far we have a strong sense of disappointment.\u201d\nWhile there have been other issues \u2014 new United States bases planned for Colombia and a slow movement toward engagement with Cuba \u2014 much of the disappointment stems from the administration\u2019s handling of the crisis that began June 28 when Honduran troops detained Mr. Zelaya and forced him into exile.\nMr. Obama was one of the first to condemn the coup and call for Mr. Zelaya to be restored. Rather than impose a strategy for handling the crisis, the White House collaborated with the rest of the region in support of negotiations between Mr. Zelaya and the conservative leaders of Honduras\u2019s de facto government.\nSince then, the United States policy toward Honduras has been marked by mixed signals and vague objectives. The State Department was pulled in one direction by Democrats, who supported Mr. Zelaya, and another by Republicans, who sought to weaken the administration\u2019s resolve to reinstate him.\nThe administration suspended some $30 million in assistance to Honduras, but continued the bulk of its aid \u2014 worth hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 saying it did not want to punish the majority of Hondurans living in poverty.\nThe United States was slow to criticize human rights abuses by the de facto government, but swift to scold Mr. Zelaya for political stunts that culminated with his sneaking back into Honduras, where he remains camped inside the Brazilian Embassy.\nThe move that seems to have most undermined Mr. Obama\u2019s clout came last month when the administration reversed course by signaling that it would accept the outcome of Sunday\u2019s elections whether or not Mr. Zelaya was restored to power.\nLatin American governments accused the administration of putting pragmatism over principle and of siding with Honduran military officers and business interests whose goal was to use the elections to legitimize the coup.\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s credibility in the region has been seriously weakened,\u201d said Kevin Casas-Zamora, a Latin America expert at the Brookings Institution and a former vice president of Costa Rica. \u201cIn a matter of five months, his administration\u2019s position on the coup has gone from indignation to indifference to confusion to acquiescence.\u201d\nIn interviews, senior administration officials rejected that view, saying that their strategy shifted as the crisis evolved, but that they never abandoned the region\u2019s shared principles.\nMr. Zelaya, once a darling of the Honduran upper classes, fell from favor when he began increasing the minimum wage, reducing the price of fuel and allying himself with President Ch\u00e1vez. His critics say he crossed a line when he defied the Supreme Court and pushed a referendum to change the Constitution so that he could run for another term. The court called in the military.\nThe longer the crisis went on, administration officials said, the more they feared Honduras would become another Haiti, where sanctions against a military regime pushed the hemisphere\u2019s poorest country to the brink of collapse.\n\u201cWe understand that we have to build consensus and that we have to work multilaterally, but we can\u2019t sacrifice a country to do that,\u201d said a senior administration official, who like others interviewed for this article asked not to be identified because he or she were discussing diplomatic deliberations. \u201cNot recognizing the elections unless President Zelaya is restored to power doesn\u2019t get us anywhere.\u201d\nOn Sunday, President Obama sent a letter to President da Silva laying out his arguments. And on Monday, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, Arturo Valenzuela, made the administration\u2019s case before the Organization of American States, saying the election was not an effort to \u201cwhitewash a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d Instead, he said, it was an opportunity to permit \u201cthe Honduran people to exercise their sovereign will.\u201d\nWith the exception of Panama and Costa Rica, no other countries in the region have publicly said they will join the United States in recognizing the vote.\n\u201cThey really thought he was different,\u201d said Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations, referring to Latin America\u2019s view of Mr. Obama, adding, \u201cBut those hopes were dashed over the course of the summer.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/world/americas/28honduras.html", "title": "Region Finds U.S. Lacking on Honduras", "author": "GINGER THOMPSON"}

Taliban leaders have steadfastly refused to accept the Afghan Constitution or to take part in the election, which is scheduled for Aug. 20.\nIndeed, Mr. Karzai\u2019s remarks, made at a news conference at the presidential palace in downtown Kabul, pointed to concerns Afghan and American officials here have about their ability to protect the voters on election day.\nAfghans are scheduled to choose a president and members of provincial councils. So far, Taliban leaders have remained silent about whether they intend to disrupt the election.\nLast time around, during the presidential election of 2004 and the legislative elections of 2005, the Taliban mostly held back. Afghan and American officials here are hoping the guerrillas will do likewise this time, concluding that trying to interfere with the election would prove deeply unpopular among ordinary Afghans.\nEarlier this year, Taliban fighters allowed voter registration to go forward. During that period, more than four million Afghans registered for the first time.\nThere are reasons for pessimism, however. The Taliban are far stronger now than they were in 2005, and they are active in more areas. According to American officials, the first week in June was the most violent week since the ouster of the Taliban from Kabul in November 2001.\nThe election in August will be a far-flung enterprise, a logistical wonder that could be vulnerable to attack. Some 16 million Afghans are registered to vote. They will cast ballots at any one of 7,000 polling places scattered across this mountainous, impoverished land.\nThousands of election observers, from here and abroad, will try to ensure the fairness of the voting.\nTroops and police officers, Afghan and foreign, will try to ensure that the vote proceeds safely. About 97,000 Afghan police officers, along with 89,500 Afghan soldiers, will form the first lines of defense around the voting areas. They will have the support of some 90,000 Western troops, about 60,000 of whom are American.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/world/asia/28afghan.html", "title": "Karzai Urges Taliban to Cast Votes", "author": "DEXTER FILKINS"}

{"date": "Fri, 25 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Four and a half years ago, Vladimir V. Putin came up with an idea to help re-establish Russia as an important player in the Middle East: The country would sponsor a peace conference in Moscow, invite all the major parties in the conflict and chaperone them toward a settlement.\nYet despite regular appeals by top Russian officials, the proposal by Mr. Putin, who has since switched from being a powerful president to an unusually powerful prime minister, has never gotten off the ground. Russia\u2019s inability to hold the conference has instead underscored the difficulties that it faces as it tries to reclaim the kind of influence on the world stage once wielded by the Soviet Union.\nJust this week, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on a visit to Egypt, said that the Kremlin was still intent on holding the Moscow conference, though he acknowledged that it was no closer to being realized.\nHe suggested that with the current atmosphere of distrust between Israelis and Palestinians, the time might not be right for them to sit at the negotiating table. But Russia\u2019s latest push for the Moscow conference began in June, when President Dmitri A. Medvedev declared that it would be held by the end of the year. Before that, during the Israeli military offense in Gaza in January, the United Nations Security Council passed a cease-fire resolution that included support for the Moscow meeting.\nRussian officials regularly raise the issue in diplomatic meetings, and last year they even went so far as to publish a possible agenda for the conference. Their unwillingness to abandon the proposal illustrates the symbolism it holds for Russian diplomacy, analysts said.\n\u201cBy proposing to help with conflict resolution, Russia can obtain, most of all, image dividends,\u201d said Prof. Irina D. Zvyagelskaya of the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow.\nMoscow has been shifting its role in the Middle East. In Soviet times it staunchly backed the Arab side, but in recent years it has sought to portray itself as more of an evenhanded broker.\nWhile not abandoning its Arab allies, it has strengthened ties to Israel, in part because of the influence there of Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who make up 15 to 20 percent of the population.\nThe Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, an immigrant from the former Soviet republic of Moldova, has held frequent talks with Russian diplomats and visited Moscow this year.\n\u201cThis is what unites us with Israel, like with no other country of the world,\u201d Mr. Putin told Mr. Lieberman this month, referring to the immigrant population in Israel.\nTrade has grown, and Israel has become a popular tourist destination for Russians. Last year, the two countries lifted visa requirements for tourists.\nAt the same time, Russia is the only member of the so-called quartet on the Middle East \u2014 which includes United States, the European Union and the United Nations \u2014 to maintain relations with Hamas.\nThe United States considers Hamas, which controls Gaza, to be a terrorist group, but Russian officials have said that it is important to have a diplomatic channel to Hamas.\nWhile Israel has publicly discouraged Russia from talking to Hamas, some Israeli diplomats have expressed hope that the Kremlin might be able to moderate it.\nIn pressing for the Middle East conference, the Kremlin seems to be engaging in a diplomatic competition with the United States. It is keenly aware that when the Bush administration decided to set up its own Middle East conference in 2007 in Annapolis, Md., it brought the parties together relatively quickly. And so Russia\u2019s failure to do the same, year after year, appears to have stung, even if the United States did not succeed in bringing peace.\n\u201cRussia wants to confirm its independent position and to show that not only Americans, with their conference in Annapolis, or the French, who gathered donors in Paris, but also Russians are equally important in the Middle Eastern peace process,\u201d said Yevgeny Y. Satanovsky, president of the Institute of the Middle East in Moscow.\nIn interviews, Israeli and Palestinian diplomats in Moscow were divided in their attitudes toward the proposed conference. The Israelis indicated that they were not eager for intense negotiations, but they did not reject the conference outright, as if they did not want to offend the Russians.\n\u201cOnce the broken-down negotiations are renewed and moved forward in a constructive way, all of us assume that the idea of a Moscow conference will become again more feasible,\u201d said Anna Azari, the departing Israeli ambassador in Russia.\nThe Palestinians were more positive. \u201cIt is important for us to certify our efforts in front of the international community,\u201d said the Palestinian representative in Moscow, Fayed Mustafa.\nAfter promoting the conference for so long, the Russian leadership could find itself in a difficult situation if it continues to be delayed, or is finally convened and an accord is not reached.\n\u201cWhen the process of negotiating stops, more alarming factors always come into play and can lead to disastrous consequences,\u201d said Aleksandr V.

{"date": "Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "NAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Somalia is once again a raging battle zone, with jihadists pouring in from overseas, preparing for a final push to topple the transitional government.\nThe government is begging for help, saying that more peacekeepers, more money and more guns could turn the tide against the Islamist radicals.\nBut the reality may be uglier than either side is willing to admit: Somalia has become the war that nobody can win, at least not right now.\nNone of the factions \u2014 the moderate Islamist government, the radical Shabab militants, the Sufi clerics who control some parts of central Somalia, the clan militias who control others, the autonomous government of Somaliland in the northwest and the semiautonomous government of Puntland in the northeast \u2014 seem powerful enough, organized enough or popular enough to overpower the other contenders and end the violence that has killed thousands over the past two years.\nSomalia analysts say the main event, the government versus the Shabab, will drag on for months, fueled by outside support on both sides. The United Nations and Western countries see the transitional government, however feeble, as their best bulwark against piracy and Islamist extremism in Somalia, and are pumping in hundreds of millions of dollars for the government\u2019s security. At the same time, the Shabab are kept afloat by an influx of weapons and fighters, much of it reported to be flowing through neighboring Eritrea.\nThe Shabab, more than anyone else, have succeeded in internationalizing Somalia\u2019s conflict and using their jihadist dreams to draw in foreign fighters from around the globe, including the United States. The Shabab, whose name means youth in Arabic, are a mostly under-40 militia who espouse the strict Wahhabi version of Islam and are guided, according to American diplomats, by another, better-known Wahhabi group: Al Qaeda.\nAhmedou Ould-Abdallah, the top United Nations envoy for Somalia, said that there were now several hundred foreign jihadists fighting for the Shabab. He noted that they were \u201cmore motivated, better organized and better trained\u201d than typical Somali street fighters, who tend to be teenagers paid a few dollars a day to charge blindly into battle with rusty Kalashnikov rifles. These young combatants know as much about military tactics as they do about school, which is not a lot. Class has essentially been out for the past 18 years, since Somalia\u2019s central government collapsed.\nBut the Shabab have limitations, too. In the past few weeks, the Shabab and their allies all but seized Somalia\u2019s capital, Mogadishu, and sealed the escape routes out of the city. In the end, though, they were unable to overrun those very last, but strategically vital, areas the government still controls, like the port, the airport and the hilltop presidential palace.\nThe new Shabab overseas recruits have imported to Somalia the tricks of Al Qaeda\u2019s trade, like remote-controlled explosives and suicide bombs. But as Iraq and Sri Lanka have shown, insurgents need more than suicide bombs to take over a country. They need overwhelming force, or a persuasive ideology and governing strategy, all of which the Shabab currently lack. The only role that seems fit for them right now is that of spoiler.\n\u201cThe Shabab can\u2019t govern,\u201d said Hassan Gabre, a retired engineer in Mogadishu. He said the Shabab were simply part of Somalia\u2019s industry of violence, trying to defend \u201cthe anarchy regime.\u201d\nShabab clerics are quick to put their austere version of Islam into effect in the territory they seize, recently amputating the hand of a convicted thief and then dangling the lifeless, bloody results in front of a shocked crowd in Kismayo, a port town in southern Somalia. But this may be just a gruesome side show.\nMr. Ould-Abdallah spoke of a \u201chidden agenda\u201d and suggested that the real reason the Shabab and their allies were in control of Kismayo was a confluence of sinister business interests like gun-running, human smuggling and the underground charcoal trade.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an economic dimension here,\u201d he said.\nIt was not always like this. The Shabab were a crucial part of a functioning mini-government in 2006, when an alliance of Islamic courts briefly controlled much of south-central Somalia. The Shabab\u2019s controversial religious policies were tempered then by moderate Islamists, who delivered services like neighborhood clean-ups and community policing, and as a result the whole Islamic movement won grass-roots support. In the end, the experiment lasted only six months, until Ethiopian troops, backed by American military forces, invaded and drove the Islamists underground.\nThat intervention failed. The Islamists returned as a fearsome guerrilla force and the Ethiopians pulled out this January, setting Somalia more or less back to where it had been in 2006, with 17,000 people killed in the process (according to Somali human rights groups). Moderate Islamist leaders then took over the transitional government, nominally protected by 4,300 African Union peacekeepers.\nBut no one is especially well liked in Mogadishu these days, not even the peacekeepers, who may have the most dangerous peacekeeping mission of all. Many Somalis turned against them after a deadly episode in February when a roadside blast hit an African Union truck and the peacekeepers responded by firing wildly into a crowded street. According to Somali officials, the peacekeepers killed 39 civilians, though the African Union said that the true figure was much lower and that the people had died in a cross-fire. Radical Islamists are now calling the African troops \u201cbacteria.\u201d\nAll this could be an opportunity for the transitional government. After all, the new president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, rose to popularity as a neighborhood problem solver, best known for helping free kidnapped children.\nBut Sheik Sharif\u2019s government seems hobbled by the same tired, intractable clan divisions and lack of skills that torpedoed the 14 previous transitional governments. There have been glimmers of hope, such as the government passing a national budget for the first time in years and using legitimate tax money from Mogadishu\u2019s port to pay its soldiers. But the bigger picture is grim. In the past few weeks, it proved very difficult for the government even to organize its various militias to jointly defend the few blocks it still controls.\nThe pattern is clear, and may not be broken anytime soon: A weak government means more violence, means weaker government, which means still more violence, and so on.\n\u201cWith all the fighting that\u2019s going on, this government can\u2019t attract the best Somalis,\u201d said Mohamed Osman Aden, a Somali diplomat in Kenya. \u201cThe good Somalis are not going to come when it\u2019s so violent.

The military said that when the ship\u2019s crew was instructed on Wednesday not to try to reach Gaza, the crew replied that the vessel would go to El Arish, in Egypt, but it then changed course.\n\u201cDuring today\u2019s morning hours, the cargo ship changed its bearing, and began heading toward the Gaza Strip, contrary to the claims made by the boat crew last evening,\u201d the military statement said. \u201cDisregarding all warnings made, the cargo boat entered Gazan coastal waters.\u201d\nThe Israeli military said humanitarian goods found on the boat would be sent into Gaza.\nAmong some 20 people aboard was the former archbishop of Jerusalem, Msgr. Hilarion Capucci, who was convicted of smuggling guns from Lebanon to Israel in 1975 and spent two years in an Israeli prison.\nA reporter for Al Jazeera who was also on board spoke by telephone to television viewers, saying that the Israelis who took over the boat had pointed weapons and assaulted some of those on the ship. The connection to his telephone was then cut.\nIsrael has maintained a strict blockade of Gaza since Hamas took power there in a brief civil war with its secular rival, Fatah, in June 2007. In late December, Israel mounted a three-week military assault in Gaza that left more than 1,300 Palestinians dead. Thirteen Israelis, including three civilians, also died.\nA number of boats run by activists have challenged Israel\u2019s control of Gaza\u2019s waters. Israel has let a few boats in and turned others back. The incident Thursday was the first since the war ended last month.\nIsrael\u2019s foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, said Thursday that the action against the latest attempt to break the sea blockade \u201cproved that things will be done differently\u201d from now on.\nThe Arab League\u2019s permanent observer to the United Nations condemned the interception of the boat as \u201can act of piracy.\u201d\nIn Gaza, John Ging, the director of operations for the United Nations refugee agency there, said Thursday that Israel\u2019s blockade was creating growing misery by choking off basic humanitarian supplies like food, medicine, clothes and blankets, as well as school supplies.\nHe also criticized the leadership of Hamas for letting its police force run wild, attacking a distribution center for the needy and carting off supplies.\n\u201cWe are neither getting in the volume nor the range of supplies that we need here,\u201d he told reporters at the United Nations, via video link-up. \u201cThis is creating a lot of misery among the people.\u201d\nIn one example, Mr. Ging said that the teachers in the schools run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency had worked throughout the Israeli bombardment to create a new human rights curriculum. But because Israel was blocking paper supplies, the textbooks and workbooks could not be printed, so some 60 percent of the children in United Nations schools lack books.\nThe human rights curriculum was intended to combat extremism, he said, a growing problem in the wake of the Israeli bombardment. Gazans are particularly frustrated, he said, because they have seen news reports about generous donations from around the world stuck just outside the enclave. It is premature to talk about Gaza\u2019s reconstruction until the issue of access for basic humanitarian supplies is fixed, Mr. Ging said.\nAs for Hamas, Mr. Ging called on its leadership to control its rank and file after armed policemen looted blankets and food from a United Nations compound. While Hamas leaders remained in hiding, he said, \u201cthose above the ground seem bent on acting in a reckless manner.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/world/middleeast/06mideast.html", "title": "Israeli Navy Diverts Ship Bound for Gaza", "author": "ETHAN BRONNER and ISABEL KERSHNER"}
{"date": "Mon, 06 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 A series of six car bombings in and near Baghdad killed at least 33 people and wounded scores on Monday, according to witnesses and the police, in a convulsion of violence that underscored the heightened tensions between Sunni fighters and Iraq\u2019s government.\nMost of the bombs struck largely Shiite neighborhoods, but there did not appear to be any other obvious pattern to the attacks. There were no claims of responsibility, and Iraqis disagreed about whom to blame.\nThe bombings began after dawn and continued until shortly after noon. Four of the bombings occurred in or near markets as they filled with morning shoppers.\n\u201cWe are all so simple,\u201d said Hussein Jawad, 40, a construction worker who was wounded in the first attack, which occurred at 7 a.m. when a parked car exploded outside a row of grocery stores and restaurants in the Alawi neighborhood in central Baghdad.\n\u201cWe are all workers,\u201d said Mr. Jawad, his head swathed in bandages covering cuts from shrapnel or flying glass. He said he could not understand why a bomb had been planted there, except as sabotage. \u201cWe are not a military outpost. This is a public place.\u201d\nAt least four people died in that explosion, including a man selling tea from a sidewalk cart. Fifteen others were wounded.\nAlthough violence remains low in Iraq compared with the peak of ethnic and sectarian bloodshed in 2006 and 2007, American and Iraqi officials have expressed concern about a recent spike in attacks.\nThey have attributed the violence \u2014 car bombs, suicide bombs and assassinations \u2014 to insurgents, militia fighters and criminals seeking to exploit the withdrawal of American soldiers from positions in cities before a June deadline set by the new security agreement between the United States and Iraq.\nA spokesman for the American military referred questions to the Iraqi government and said it would be premature to assess the sources or motives behind Monday\u2019s attacks.\nAdel Berwari, a Kurdish member of the security and defense committee in Parliament, blamed Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia for the attacks, as well as other extremists trying to sow chaos after recent improvements in security. None of the bombings were suicide attacks, which have been a signature of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a homegrown Sunni extremist group with some foreign leadership.\n\u201cIt is an attempt to sabotage what has been achieved by the Iraqi government,\u201d he told Al Iraqiya, the government television network.\nA prominent Shiite legislator, Abbas al-Bayati, suggested a link between the violence and members of the Sunni Awakening movement, made up of former insurgents who joined with American and Iraqi forces beginning in 2006. A simmering dispute over pay for the Awakening members and the arrest of an Awakening leader last month in the Fadhil neighborhood of Baghdad led to clashes between the group and Iraqi forces. He also blamed remnants of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Baath Party for the violence.\nMonday\u2019s bombings occurred three days before the April 9 anniversary of the fall of Baghdad in 2003, a day those who remain loyal to the Baath Party view as the beginning of a struggle against foreign occupation. Also, Tuesday is the anniversary of the party\u2019s founding in Iraq.\n\u201cThe Baath Party, as an organization, is weak here in Iraq, and this party may take some advantage of the violence, but they do not have the ability to affect the situation,\u201d Mr. Bayati said.\nShortly after the first attack, another bomb in a parked car exploded in what appeared to be an assassination attempt against a convoy carrying an Interior Ministry official. The official, identified by the ministry only as Brigadier Sadoon, escaped injury, but a guard and a bystander were killed and four others were wounded, the ministry said.\nStill another car bomb exploded in a market in Husseiniya, a suburb northeast of Baghdad, killing 4 and wounding 20. Two other bombings struck in Um al-Maalif, in the southern section of the city. At least 12 died and more than 25 were wounded in those blasts. The first struck a market, the second a clinic nearby.\nThe deadliest bombing killed at least 11 people in the Areba market in Sadr City, an impoverished Shiite neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad, according to hospital officials. Witnesses at the scene said as many as 20 died, while the police said 7 were killed, underscoring the confusion that often surrounds death tolls here.\nAt least 30 others were wounded in the Sadr City explosion, though different Interior Ministry officials put the number of wounded between 50 and 65. Among those killed was Ali Jassin Yussef, an emergency room doctor at the Kindi Hospital in Baghdad, where some of the wounded were taken.\nAnger coursed through the market after the bombing as residents gathered body parts in plastic shopping bags and confronted Iraqi security forces with shouts and stones. The Iraqi Army cordoned off the area, and soldiers opened fire at one point to control the crowds. An ambulance carrying a man wounded in the shooting struck and killed a woman on the way to the hospital.\nMohammed Abdul Khadim, a tribal leader standing near the market after the bombing, blamed the Americans for the attack. He said he wanted control of the area returned to the Mahdi Army, the fractured militia loyal to the cleric Moktada al-Sadr that Iraqi and American forces drove out last year.\n\u201cIf only the Mahdi Army controlled the area like before,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be much better now.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/world/middleeast/07iraq.html", "title": "Six Car Bombs Kill at Least 33 in Iraq", "author": "STEVEN LEE MYERS"}

The United Nations Security Council passed an enhanced package of sanctions against the isolated nation on Friday in response to its second underground nuclear test in three years, as well as repeated missile launchings.\nAccording to Tuesday\u2019s report, the journalists were detained on the North Korean side of the Tumen River, which serves as part of the boundary between China and North Korea. The Tumen has been used for years by North Korean refugees defecting across the border.\nUnlike the swift and deep Yalu River, which runs along most of the border between the countries, the Tumen is shallow and narrow, and is easily crossed in spots on foot or by swimming.\nThe KCNA report said that the women\u2019s own confiscated video indicated that they crossed the river illegally. It also said that the women had admitted to fabricating some aspects of their video in order to \u201cdefile\u201d the government\u2019s human rights record.\n\u201cDuring their trial, they admitted that what they did was a criminal act inspired by political motives of isolating and stifling our republic by defiling our human rights situation through fabricated video footage,\u201d the news agency said.\nThe two women were given courtroom interpreters during their trial at the Central Court, the North\u2019s highest court. Ms. Ling was defended by a lawyer, but Ms. Lee gave up her right to hire a lawyer. The ruling cannot be appealed, the news agency said.\n\u201cThe criminals admitted and accepted the judgment,\u201d the report said.\nHuman rights advocates in South Korea who had helped arrange their trip to China have said that the journalists were on a reporting assignment about the plight of North Korean women sold through human traffickers and refugees fleeing hunger in North Korea when they were detained on March 17. The journalists\u2019 families said they had no intention of crossing the border to the North Korean side.\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called the charges against them \u201cbaseless.\u201d Washington has said it will employ \u201call possible channels to secure their release.\u201d\nAmerican officials have said that the heavy sentences would likely be used as a negotiating ploy by the North as it tries to fend off a new United Nations resolution that imposes a mandatory ban on arms sales and calls on members to inspect cargo vessels and airplanes suspected of carrying military equipment in or out of the country.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/world/asia/17confess.html", "title": "North Korea Says Journalists Admitted Crimes", "author": "CHOE SANG-HUN"}

{"date": "Tue, 14 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "FORWARD OPERATING BASE ALTIMUR, Afghanistan \u2014 The call came just after dinner: a pickup truck carrying Afghan national police officers had hit a buried bomb, and all five officers inside were dead.\nWhen First Lt. James Brown and his team of bomb investigators arrived at the shredded remains of the truck, the grim significance of the attack became clear. One of the dead was a hard-charging commander who, more than any officer in this restive district of Logar Province, had helped fight a shadowy network of local bomb makers.\n\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t trying so hard, if he was taking bribes, taking naps, he\u2019d be alive right now,\u201d Lieutenant Brown said of the commander, Gul Alam.\nThis is the war in Afghanistan today, where death is measured less by the accuracy of bullets than by the cleverness of bombs. And though the Afghan insurgency\u2019s improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.\u2019s, are less powerful or complex than those used in Iraq, they are becoming more common and more sophisticated with each week, American military officers say.\nThis year, bomb attacks on coalition troops in Afghanistan have spiked to an all-time high, with 465 in May alone, more than double the number in the same month two years before. At least 46 American troops have been killed by I.E.D.\u2019s this year, putting 2009 on track to set a record in the eight-year war.\nI.E.D.\u2019s have been even more deadly for Afghan police officers and soldiers. At the current rate, I.E.D. attacks on Afghan forces could reach 6,000 this year, up from 81 in 2003, an American military official said. In early July alone, nine Afghan police officers were killed in two bomb attacks in Logar Province, south of Kabul.\nWith few paved roads, Afghanistan is even more fertile territory for I.E.D.\u2019s. than Iraq, where hard pavement often forced insurgents to leave bombs in the open. Not so in Afghanistan, where it is relatively easy to bury a device in a dirt road and cover the tracks.\nEven when I.E.D.\u2019s do not wound or kill troops, the threat restricts and complicates the movements of coalition forces.\nAmerican convoys often must wait for bomb-detection teams that move at three miles per hour. Helicopters are limited, and most troops travel in mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles known as MRAPs, which are lumbering and hard to maneuver. Though heavily armored MRAPs are effective in shielding soldiers from explosions, two turret gunners died recently when one flipped over after hitting I.E.D.\u2019s.\nAcknowledging that the I.E.D. has become perhaps its central military problem in Afghanistan, the Pentagon is sending thousands of MRAPs to Afghanistan and is developing a lighter, more maneuverable version. It has deployed robots, dogs and drones to detect and dispose of bombs.\nIt has also begun a campaign to attack the bomb-making networks that operate in small cells around the country.\nAt the heart of that effort are teams like Lieutenant Brown\u2019s that, with the help of explosives experts and criminal investigators, compile and analyze forensic information on almost every bomb encountered and every suspect detained.\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in the triggerman,\u201d said Lieutenant Brown, whose team is with the Third Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment based here. \u201cHe\u2019s usually some poor schlep just trying to feed his family. It\u2019s the networks we\u2019re after.\u201d\nAmerican officials say those Taliban-guided networks are surprisingly layered, involving financiers, logistical experts, bomb designers and trainers. At the bottom are the bomb planters, often villagers or nomadic herdsmen paid $10 or less to dig holes and serve as spotters.\nThe bombs are often made with fertilizer and diesel fuel, but some use mortar shells or old mines that litter the countryside. Some bombs are set off when vehicles pass over pressure plates. Others require remote control, like a cellphone. Still others detonate with a button or a wire touched to a battery.\nThough many bombs remain crude, American officers say the insurgents are cunning and relentlessly adaptive. In some cases, I.E.D.\u2019s are used as lures to draw soldiers into booby traps.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like Iraq,\u201d said Tech Sgt. Richard Gibbons of the Air Force, the team expert in disarming and disposing of explosives, recalling complex situations involving four or more bombs in Baghdad. \u201cBut I do think they are getting better.\u201d\nLike a police forensic unit and a bomb squad rolled into one, Lieutenant Brown\u2019s 25-member team not only disarms I.E.D.\u2019s but also scours sites \u2014 more than 50 this year \u2014 for telltale signatures of a bomb. Soil samples, electrical parts, fingerprints and photographs are sent for analysis, and detailed reports are compiled in a central database.\nAmerican officials say the work has helped dismantle at least one network, pinpointed others and improved safety for convoys. But as the death of Mr. Alam underscores, the effort is one step forward, one step back.\nThe American strategy calls for using the Afghan police to gather intelligence, arrest people suspected of being bombers and project a sense of government competence. So far, many Afghan police units have not risen to the challenge, American officers complain.\nMr. Alam was different. A father in his late 30s, he was known as an ebullient, bold, sometimes reckless fighter. He once tried to dismantle an I.E.D. made from an old mine with his bare hands.\n\u201cNot proper procedure, but it showed initiative,\u201d Lieutenant Brown said.\nMr. Alam was the commander of a checkpoint near the border of the Charkh and Baraki Barak districts, a stronghold of Taliban supporters. When more than 1,200 soldiers with the Third Combat Brigade, 10th Mountain Division flowed into the province early this year, there were scattered firefights, but the insurgents mostly melted into the landscape.\nAnd then the I.E.D. attacks multiplied. After seeing two bombs in the area in May, American forces found or exploded 17 I.E.D.\u2019s in June, most along an important connector they call Route New York.\nStill, Lieutenant Brown\u2019s team felt it was making headway. In recent weeks, American forces killed two men planting a bomb, detained one suspected of being a triggerman and uncovered a cache of weapons and bomb-making materials.\nMr. Alam helped, and so became a target. Following a weekly routine, he spent a recent Saturday with his family at home north of Kabul and was returning to his checkpoint that afternoon when the bomb exploded under his truck, dead center.\nAfter the explosion, Lieutenant Brown, 31, gathered his team in their office, its plywood walls decorated with handmade farming tools found at bomb sites. Bowing his head, he asked for a moment of silence for Mr. Alam.\n\u201cThe guy was never in a bad mood,\u201d Lieutenant Brown recalled later. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that is possible given his job.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/world/asia/15ied.html", "title": "Afghan War\u2019s Buried Bombs Put Risk in Every Step", "author": "JAMES DAO"}

It also included a general amnesty for all political crimes, a tacit recognition that the country could not move forward unless the events surrounding the June 28 coup were pushed aside.\nMr. Zelaya\u2019s delegation accepted all the points, Mr. Arias said.\nBut Mr. Micheletti\u2019s delegation arrived Sunday morning with a counteroffer that rejected Mr. Zelaya\u2019s reinstatement as president and proposed instead that he return home to stand trial.\nThe de facto government charges that Mr. Zelaya committed a series of crimes as he pushed for a referendum that could lead to rewriting the Constitution. His opponents said the move was aimed at letting him run for re-election.\nMr. Arias said he would press both sides to give him 72 hours more to work on a solution.\nMr. Zelaya said late Sunday in Nicaragua that he would begin preparing his return to Honduras this week but would first give Mr. Arias\u2019s diplomacy more time.\nBy rejecting Mr. Arias\u2019s mediation, the de facto government risks isolating itself even further. It has not been recognized by any country, while the United States, the United Nations and the Organization of American States have stood behind Mr. Zelaya as the legitimate president of Honduras and called for his return.\nThe Obama administration has also cut $16.5 million in military aid to Honduras and threatened to cut some $180 million in development aid.

Two Sudanese guards kidnapped along with them were later released.\nThe three \u2014 a Canadian nurse, an Italian doctor and a French coordinator working for Doctors Without Borders \u2014 were abducted from their compound in Serif Umra, some 130 miles west of El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur State, said Erwin Van \u2019t Land, a spokesman for the aid group\u2019s Belgian branch, speaking by telephone from Brussels.\nThe aid workers were taken at gunpoint from their guarded compound at 8:50 p.m., he said, and there were reports that the kidnappers were in two pickup trucks.\nThe aid workers were able to make a brief telephone call shortly afterward to report that they were unharmed, Mr. Van \u2019t Land said. But there has been no contact with them since, he said, and no claims of responsibility. He said the abductions took the group by surprise.\n\u201cWe had not received any warning of this,\u201d Mr. Van \u2019t Land said.\nThe kidnappings came a week after Sudan\u2019s government expelled 13 foreign relief organizations in the wake of a decision by the International Criminal Court in The Hague to issue an arrest warrant for Sudan\u2019s president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur.\nThe French and Dutch arms of Doctors Without Borders were among the groups ordered to leave, but the organization said the order did not apply to three sections that remained, the Belgian, Swiss and Spanish sections. The abducted workers were with the Belgian section.\nThe United Nations has said the expulsions will sharply reduce humanitarian assistance to more than a million civilians in Darfur, where the Khartoum government has led a brutal campaign to rout rebels since 2003. The United Nations estimates that up to 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict, and that 2.7 million have been driven from their homes.\nAid convoys and workers are frequently attacked in Darfur by bandits, and this week four peacekeepers traveling in a vehicle in West Darfur were shot and wounded.\nBut the abductions of aid workers from a guarded compound \u201cis quite unprecedented,\u201d said Kemal Saiki, the communications director for the joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur, located in El Fasher.\nThe official spokesman of the government-run humanitarian aid commission in Khartoum, Dr. Mohamed Fadl Allah, said Thursday in a telephone interview that not much information was available about the abductions, and that it was not clear which armed group was involved. Local authorities are doing their best to get the aid workers released, he said.\nOn Thursday, Doctors Without Borders said remaining medical teams in Darfur would be withdrawn. A skeleton team will remain to follow the case of the abducted colleagues, the organization said in a statement. The group said its services to some 400,000 Sudanese had been interrupted by last week\u2019s expulsions.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/world/africa/13sudan.html", "title": "Gunmen Kidnap 3 Workers With Aid Group in Darfur", "author": "SHARON OTTERMAN"}
{"date": "Fri, 13 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "DHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Sheikh Hasina survived when gunmen executed her father and extended family late one summer night in 1975. She survived again when assassins hurled 13 grenades at her political rally in 2004, killing two dozen people.\nToday, about two months into her tenure as prime minister of this fractious, poor and coup-prone country, she confronts her greatest crucible yet: an unusually savage mutiny by border guards last month that left soldiers buried in mass graves and widened the gulf between her fragile administration and the military.\nAltogether, 74 people were killed, mostly army officers in command of the border force.\nTwo separate investigations are under way to identify those responsible: one by the army, another by Mrs. Hasina\u2019s government. Whether either will yield credible results is unknown. Mrs. Hasina\u2019s fate and the stability of the country depend on the outcome.\nIn an interview this week, Mrs. Hasina called the mutiny \u201ca big conspiracy\u201d against her agenda to establish a secular democracy in this Muslim-majority nation of 150 million. She struck a note of defiant resolve.\n\u201cNo one will stop me,\u201d she said. \u201cI will continue.\u201d Then she raised her eyebrows and offered a hint of a smile. \u201cWe have to unearth all these conspiracies.\u201d\nMrs. Hasina, 61, has the air of a strict grandmother. She speaks softly. She wears traditional Bengali saris that cover her head. Her eyes are a cool gray.\nShe said she was keen to hunt down and punish those responsible for the mutiny. She suggested that several factions unhappy with her agenda could have been responsible, including Islamist militants, whom she has vowed to crush.\n\u201cThere are many elements,\u201d she said in her first extensive interview since the Feb. 25 siege. \u201cThese terrorist groups are very much active. This incident gives us a lesson. It can happen again.\u201d\nAfter two years of army-backed rule in the country, Mrs. Hasina\u2019s won a resounding majority of the parliamentary seats in elections last December, after campaigning on a slate of provocative promises. She said she would root out Islamist guerillas, put on trial those suspected of conspiring against Bangladesh\u2019s independence from Pakistan in 1971, nurture friendly relations with India and stop anti-Indian insurgents from using Bangladeshi soil to launch attacks against New Delhi.\nThe election drew a turnout of around 80 percent and was cited as among the most credible and least violent here in recent years.\nThen came the massacre.\nOn the last Wednesday in February, at the headquarters of the border patrol, known as the Bangladesh Rifles, a guard pointed his weapon at the force commander. Some commotion ensued, according to investigators, and then other guards stormed the hall. Gunfire could be heard blocks away. Hundreds of civilians who lived, worked and went to school inside the compound were trapped.\nMrs. Hasina allowed the army to take position around the compound but not to storm it. She negotiated with the mutineers for the next 36 hours, first directly and then through emissaries. She offered a general amnesty and promised to address the rebels\u2019 grievances. On the second day, when they refused to surrender, she threatened to send in tanks. By the time the siege ended, more than 6,000 border guards had escaped, and an unknown quantity of weapons had been taken from the armory.\nAs the bodies of the dead soldiers were discovered, the horrific nature of the violence became evident. Some army officers had been shot at close range and then stabbed repeatedly with bayonets. Eyes were gouged out. A stack of 38 bodies was found in a mass grave.\nNo sooner did the siege end than the arguments began. Today, the bitter points of contention are whether the army commanders were killed before or after negotiations began (the time of death has not yet been established for all the victims), whether Mrs. Hasina pressed to know the scale of the killings before offering amnesty, and, most important, why she did not permit the army to storm the compound early on.\n\u201cThe government was not in charge,\u201d said Abdur Razzak, a leader of the conservative Jamaat-e-Islami party. \u201cThis was an army problem. The army should have solved it in their wisdom.\u201d\nMr. Razzak said the mutiny was a conspiracy designed \u201cto weaken the army, to weaken the state.\u201d Mr. Razzak\u2019s party was trounced in the last election; its share of the 300 elected seats in Parliament fell to 2 from 17 in the December elections.\nMrs. Hasina said sending in the army would have resulted in a bloodbath and risked a potential conflict between the 46 border guard battalions scattered across the country and their army commanders.\nIn any case, few in Bangladesh say they believe that the mutiny was what it first appeared: a rebellion of rank-and-file border guards aggrieved by their commanders, their pay and their working conditions. In a country where conspiracy theories are a national sport, the mutiny has become a screen onto which many anxieties are projected.\nSome point to terrorist groups and anti-Indian insurgents. Others say that it was fueled by intelligence agencies in either India or Pakistan \u2014 both countries have been alternately friend and foe to Bangladesh. There are those who suggest that it could involve politicians who lost the last election, while others blame people within Mrs. Hasina\u2019s party whose goal is to keep the army in check.\nThe truth of what happened may never be known. Bangladesh holds many mysteries in its heart, including the question of who ordered the killing of Mrs. Hasina\u2019s father, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, a former prime minister. Mrs. Hasina was spared only because she had been visiting her husband in Europe at the time. Eighteen members of her family, including her brothers and their wives, were executed.\nCentral to Mrs. Hasina\u2019s survival today is keeping the military on her side. Her face-off with the army came into sharp focus three days after the mutiny ended when she confronted an unusually rowdy room of army officers. They berated her for not allowing the army to take charge early on. The screaming match was recorded and put up on YouTube, shocking the nation.\nThis week, in the interview, Mrs. Hasina said she sympathized with the soldiers\u2019 grief even as she cautioned them against taking revenge \u2014 or power. So far, the army does not seem interested.\nMrs. Hasina\u2019s most deadly enemies have been the Islamist militant groups that have put down roots here in recent years. They have been implicated in assassination attempts against her, including the grenade attack on her political meeting in August 2004. Mrs. Hasina lost some of her hearing as a result of that attack. Sitting under a framed portrait of her father, she said she would not be bowed.\n\u201cIf I am afraid for my life, the whole nation will be afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cI know some bullets, some grenades are chasing me.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/world/asia/14bangla.html", "title": "Bangladeshi Premier Faces a Grim Crucible", "author": "SOMINI SENGUPTA"}

He was kept at Guant\u00e1namo from January 2002 until May 15 of this year as terrorism suspect No. 10005, when he was released and put aboard a plane to France. He was kept under observation in a French military clinic until Monday, when he emerged and told some of the details of his story to The Washington Post and Le Monde, which published them on Tuesday.\nNo. 10005 \u201cwas my name there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they called me. Never Lakhdar or Boumediene,\u201d he told Le Monde.\nHe said he underwent more than 120 interrogations, mostly about foreign Muslims in Bosnia, before he stopped cooperating with his questioners. Details of his treatment could not be confirmed. He was the plaintiff in a 2008 Supreme Court case, Boumediene v. Bush, which gave detainees the right to judicial review, and he was later ordered released by a United States District Court judge in Washington.\nMr. Boumediene is one of about 60 detainees considered by the Americans to be safe to release, but Washington is finding it difficult to place them in other countries. An aid worker with the Red Crescent, he was originally suspected of being part of a plot to blow up the American and British Embassies in Sarajevo, but charges were dropped. Still, he was sent to Guant\u00e1namo and kept there for more than seven years, and was interrogated about his connections to another of the Algerians, Belkacem Bensayah, accused by investigators of being an operative for Al Qaeda in Bosnia.\nMr. Bensayah had come to his office at the Red Crescent, and Mr. Boumediene helped Mr. Bensayah\u2019s family, according to The Post.\nDuring the 16-night period of interrogation, Mr. Boumediene said that \u201csix or seven\u201d interrogators would take turns questioning him, going from midnight to 5 in the morning, then resuming a few hours later. He insisted to Le Monde that \u201cI was never an Islamist.\u201d\nUpon his release from the hospital, Mr. Boumediene, thin and bearded, joined his wife and two daughters, 13 and 8, for a lunch of pizza and orange juice. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t recognize them,\u201d he said.\nDetainee\u2019s Age in Dispute\nKABUL, Afghanistan (Reuters) \u2014 An Afghan who has spent over six years at the American military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay was only about 12 when he was detained, not 16 or 17 as his official record says, an Afghan rights group said Tuesday.\nInterviews with the family of Mohammed Jawad, who like many poor Afghans does not know his exact age or birthday, showed he was probably not even a teenager when he was arrested in 2002, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission said.\nHe was picked up by the Afghan police in connection with a grenade attack in Kabul in which two United States soldiers and their Afghan interpreter were wounded. He was transferred to American custody and flown to Guant\u00e1namo in early 2003.\nCommissioner Nader Nadery said Mr. Jawad was tortured and abused by the Afghan police and at Guant\u00e1namo.

He was released to Britain last month and is now free.\nThe document was prepared by the court last October but was not made public because, the court said, the rules of plea bargaining with the United States military commissions required confidentiality.\nHis lawyers were not even allowed to say that a plea bargain was being discussed. With negotiations ended, the court said it could release the document.\nAt one point, the document said, Mr. Mohamed had agreed to plead \u201cno defense\u201d to charges of support for terrorism in exchange for a sentence not to exceed three years, which he would be allowed to serve in Britain. The prosecutors rejected this, the court noted.\nIn a statement released Monday, a lawyer for Mr. Mohamed, Clive Stafford Smith, said his client would have pleaded guilty \u201cto being the pope himself\u201d if it would have ended his ordeal.\nMr. Mohamed, who was born in Ethiopia and moved to Britain as a teenager, was apprehended in Pakistan in April 2002 as he was trying to leave the country with a falsified British passport. He had been in Afghanistan and had undergone military training, which he said was to prepare him to fight in Chechnya.\nBut American officials initially said that he was preparing to carry out terrorist attacks in the United States.\nAt one point, American officials said he had been part of a plot to detonate a \u201cdirty bomb\u201d in the United States.\nHe was held at the United States\u2019 Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, where Mr. Mohamed says his torture began.\nA few months after his capture, he was secretly flown by the C.I.A. to Morocco, according to American and British officials.\nAs part of the Bush administration\u2019s rendition program, some terrorism suspects were transferred to countries where torture is known to be used.\nThe C.I.A. has declined to say publicly where Mr. Mohamed was held and has denied that it ever engaged in or condoned torture.\nMr. Mohamed has said that he was in Morocco for 18 months, during which time his captors used scalpels to cut his chest and genitals.\n\u201cI was in agony, crying, trying desperately to suppress myself, but I was screaming,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said this month in an interview with The Mail on Sunday, a British newspaper.\n\u201cThere was blood all over,\u201d he added. \u201cThey cut all my private parts.\u201d\nThey also tempted him with women, \u201cnaked or part naked,\u201d Mr. Mohamed told his lawyer, Mr. Stafford Smith, during an interview when he was still at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison in Cuba.\nMr. Stafford Smith made written records immediately after many of his interviews with his client, and those accounts were cleared by military censors. Mr. Stafford Smith provided the accounts, which he calls Mr. Mohamed\u2019s \u201cdiary,\u201d to The New York Times.\nOn the day Mr. Mohamed left Morocco, in the custody, he said, of American soldiers in black masks, his guards first cut off all his clothes, according to the diary. Then a \u201cwhite female with glasses\u201d took pictures of his injuries, the diary says.\n\u201cShe was one of the few Americans who ever showed me any sympathy,\u201d Mr. Mohamed is quoted as having told Mr. Stafford Smith. \u201cWhen she saw the injuries I had, she gasped. I could see the shock and horror in her eyes.\u201d\nHis lawyers have filed lawsuits to obtain these photographs, as well as 42 other classified documents, which the British court said lent credence to Mr. Mohamed\u2019s allegations.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/world/europe/24london.html", "title": "Plea Bargain Was Weighed for Guant\u00e1namo Detainee", "author": "RAYMOND BONNER"}

{"date": "Thu, 27 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine \u2014 A year after its war with Georgia, Russia is engaging in an increasingly hostile standoff with another pro-Western neighbor, Ukraine.\nRelations between the two countries are more troubled than at any time since the Soviet collapse, as both sides resort to provocations and recriminations. And it is here on the Crimean Peninsula, home to a Russian naval base, where the tensions are perhaps most in danger of bursting into open conflict.\nLate last month, the Ukrainian police briefly detained Russian military personnel who were driving truckloads of missiles through this port city, as if they were smugglers who had come ashore with a haul of contraband. Local officials, it seemed, were seeking to make clear that this was no longer friendly terrain.\nUkraine has in recent years been at the forefront of the effort by some former Soviet republics to switch their alliances to the West, and it appears that the Kremlin has, in some sense, had enough.\nPresident Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia denounced Ukraine this month for \u201canti-Russian\u201d policies, citing in particular its \u201cincessant attempts\u201d to harass Russia\u2019s naval base in Sevastopol. Mr. Medvedev condemned Ukraine\u2019s bid for NATO membership and its support for Georgia, and said he would not send an ambassador to Ukraine.\nAnd the criticism has not let up since then.\nMonday was Ukrainian independence day, and Russian prosecutors used the occasion to accuse Ukrainian soldiers and members of Ukrainian nationalist groups of fighting alongside Georgia\u2019s military in the war last August. The Ukrainians denied the charges, but they underscored the bitterness in Moscow.\nFor its part, the Ukrainian government, which took power after the Orange Revolution of 2004, has repeatedly accused Russia of acting as a bully and trying to dominate the former Soviet space both militarily and economically.\nLooming is a presidential election in Ukraine in January, which might cause Ukrainian candidates to respond more aggressively to Russia to show their independence. The Kremlin might seek to exploit the situation to help pro-Russian politicians in Kiev.\nBoth countries publicly avow that they do not want the bad feelings to spiral out of control.\nStill, they persist, especially in Sevastopol, where Russia has maintained a naval base since czarist times.\nThe Kremlin has bristled at what it sees as Ukraine\u2019s disrespectful governing of a city that it formerly controlled \u2014 one that was the site of momentous military battles, including in the Crimean War and World War II.\nUkraine appears to regard the base as a sign that Russia still wants to project its military might over the region.\nThe Ukrainians have not only briefly detained Russian military personnel transporting missiles on several occasions this summer. They also expelled a Russian diplomat who oversees naval issues and barred officers from the F.S.B., the Russian successor to the K.G.B., from working in Sevastopol.\nThe Ukrainians are trying to close a nearby Russian navigation station and are threatening penalties over supposed pollution from Russian vessels off Sevastopol, which is on the south of the Crimean Peninsula.\n\u201cUkraine has become more demanding, and has a right to do that,\u201d said the Sevastopol mayor, Sergei V. Kunitsyn, an appointee of the Ukrainian government.\nMr. Kunitsyn said Russian military trucks transporting missiles in Sevastopol had been stopped and searched by the police because their route had not been approved in advance, as is required under accords signed by Russia.\nHe insisted that day-to-day interactions involving the Russian fleet were being carried out in a businesslike manner in Sevastopol, a city of 350,000.\nHe said Ukraine was not trying to oust the Russian fleet, though he did raise the prospect of additional pressure.\n\u201cIf we wanted to, they would have such problems that they would never be able to leave the port,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to the law, we could find 1,000 reasons why the fleet could simply not live.\u201d\nThe Crimean Peninsula, which has two million people, is part of Ukraine through something of a historic fluke. In 1954, Nikita S. Khrushchev, then the Soviet leader, transferred it to Ukraine from Russia, though at the time the decision had little significance because both were part of the Soviet Union.\nBesides serving as host for the Black Sea Fleet, the peninsula had a cherished role in the Soviet era as a vacation spot, with beaches and abundant fruits and vegetables.\nAfter the Soviet fall, Russia reached a deal with Ukraine to maintain the base in Sevastopol, under a lease that ends in 2017. The Ukrainian president, Viktor A. Yushchenko, has declared that it will not be renewed, though his successors may not concur.\nThe current concern is that a spark in Crimea \u2014 however unlikely \u2014 could touch off a violent confrontation or even the kind of fighting that broke out between Russia and Georgia over the breakaway enclave of South Ossetia.\nThe situation is particularly uneasy because the population in Crimea is roughly 60 percent ethnic Russian and would prefer that the peninsula separate from Ukraine and be part of Russia. (Sevastopol has an even higher proportion of ethnic Russians.)\nPeople have been upset by new Ukrainian government policies that require the use of the Ukrainian language, rather than Russian, in government activities, including some courses in public schools. Throughout downtown Sevastopol last week, residents set up booths to gather signatures on petitions in an effort to overturn the regulations.\nAnd on Monday, Ukrainian independence day, ethnic Russians in Crimea held anti-Ukrainian demonstrations.\nSergei P. Tsekov, a senior politician in Crimea who heads the main ethnic Russian communal organization, said he hoped that Russia would wholeheartedly endorse Crimean separatism just as it did the aspirations of South Ossetia and another Georgian enclave, Abkhazia.\n\u201cThe central authorities in Ukraine are provoking the people of Crimea,\u201d Mr. Tsekov said. \u201cThey relate to us like Georgia related to the Abkhazians and South Ossetians. They think that we\u2019re going to forget our roots, our language, our history, our heroes. Only stupid people would think that we\u2019re going to do that. Unfortunately, stupid people currently lead Ukraine.\u201d\nCrimean separatists have been encouraged by prominent politicians in Russia, including Moscow\u2019s mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov, and a senior member of Parliament, Konstantin F.

{"date": "Tue, 20 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Until recently, Aleksandr Y. Khochinsky occupied a special niche in this capital, known as much for its corruption as for its wealth. He was an antiquarian who specialized in providing high-class grease for the best-connected palms in the government and other high-level circles.\nHarried businessmen would rush in off the streets to his gallery here, Bogema, and think nothing of spending tens of thousands of dollars for the right item to delight the powerful, whether a set of dueling pistols, a suit of armor, antique Rolex watches or a $2 million seascape by the Russian artist Ivan Aivazovsky.\nMr. Khochinsky prided himself on his talent for finding the perfect gift. \u201cTell me only a few details about the man,\u201d he said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cIs he a hunter, a fisherman, does he chase women? I can find a gift.\u201d\nNormally, the world Mr. Khochinsky navigated so successfully is hidden from view. But now, after a very delicate transaction that he says went horribly wrong and left him accused of blackmail by a powerful figure, he has decided to lift the veil on the cozy world he knows so well.\nThere is little chance that the dispute that has embroiled him and forced him to leave the country will be resolved; in Russia, high-level spats like this seldom are. But the deal, as described by Mr. Khochinsky, illuminates an aspect of life here for people at the intersection of business and politics at the highest levels, including the most powerful politician of them all: Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin.\nThe current entanglement began with the purchase, in 2006 at a Sotheby\u2019s auction in Paris, of 26 letters written by Voltaire to Catherine the Great, dating from 1768 to 1777. Mr. Khochinsky said he bought them for $869,000 \u2014 a world record for 18th-century handwritten texts, according to Sotheby\u2019s \u2014 for a Russian billionaire who had made his money in banking and real estate.\nHanding a little something to a bureaucrat is an old tradition in Russia \u2014 popularly known as giving \u201cgreyhound puppies,\u201d a reference to a Nikolai Gogol character who accepted only puppies as gifts.\nSergei V. Bobovnikov, a dealer in late imperial and Soviet-era decorative art, says artwork and antiquities make fine gifts for bureaucrats today, either to keep or to donate to museums. Bureaucrats, he said, \u201care buried in these gifts on their birthdays, anniversaries and so on.\u201d\nMr. Khochinsky\u2019s client wanted to give the letters to Mr. Putin, who was then president, with the idea that he could then donate them to a Russian library. In this, the billionaire was following a more recent tradition of currying favor with the Kremlin by returning cultural and historic artifacts to Russia. In the most prominent instance, Viktor F. Vekselberg, an oil and aluminum magnate, returned the Forbes family collection of Faberg\u00e9 Imperial Easter eggs to Russia in 2004, at a cost of $100 million.\nMr. Khochinsky said he saw special value in the letters as a gift to Mr. Putin. Voltaire, though critical of the 18th-century French monarchy, had famously praised Catherine the Great as an enlightened despot.\nIn the letters Mr. Khochinsky purchased, Voltaire also wrote in support of Russian military campaigns in what is now Ukraine and Poland. In essence, here was a pre-eminent European philosopher supporting a leadership role for Russia in eastern Europe, an idea back in vogue in Moscow these days.\nBut now, Mr. Khochinsky says, the letters have vanished and he is out the $869,000 purchase price because the gift was not delivered. He says the letters disappeared sometime after he gave them to Russia\u2019s Channel One, a state television outlet, to arrange a televised transfer of the documents to Mr. Putin.\nA spokesman for Mr. Putin said that the prime minister \u201cnever saw these letters, and nobody ever gave him anything like this, or will give it to him. I don\u2019t know who bought these letters, but they don\u2019t have anything to do with Putin.\u201d\nMr. Khochinsky said he filed a complaint against the station and asked the police for help in finding the letters, despite the authorities\u2019 notoriously poor record in solving high-level disputes. In their report, the police say Channel One\u2019s director, Konstantin Ernst, denied that the station had ever received the letters, and accused Mr. Khochinsky of trying to blackmail him by trying to tie him to their theft. Mr. Khochinsky has denied that allegation.\nWhile it is doubtful anyone will ever know what happened to the letters, one thing seems certain: Mr. Khochinsky\u2019s line of work, if not Mr. Khochinsky himself, will continue to play an important role in Russia. And that is not entirely a bad thing, says Mr. Bobovnikov.\n\u201cGalleries don\u2019t survive on collectors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sweetest scheme is when you have businessmen who need items for gifts. Not for collections. But for gifts. The antiquarian should know what to give. He should understand.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/world/europe/21voltaire.html", "title": "Lifting the Lid on Russia\u2019s Art of Lavish Gift Giving", "author": "ANDREW E.

{"date": "Tue, 14 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has been walking a political tightrope since the detention last week of an Australian mining executive who is accused of stealing state secrets.\nMr. Rudd, who once served as a diplomat to China and speaks fluent Mandarin, has appeared wary of taking too harsh a stand with China, Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner. And some analysts with knowledge of China say a low-key approach may be the best way of gaining more cooperation from Beijing in the case.\nBut as the Chinese government continues to provide little direct information about the case to the Australians, Mr. Rudd\u2019s conservative opponents have begun ramping up their criticism, saying his government is not doing enough on behalf of the executive, Stern Hu. The criticism builds on earlier complaints that Mr. Rudd is na\u00efvely cozy with China.\nMr. Hu was overseeing delicate iron-ore price negotiations for the Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto when he was detained more than a week ago. Three other Rio Tinto employees, all Chinese citizens, have also been detained.\nAlthough the Chinese government has offered no evidence of the charges against the four employees, a government-controlled Web site has said that state investigators have evidence that Rio workers bribed steel executives to gain access to confidential government documents. Such information could have helped Rio in its negotiations with the steel companies.\nOn Tuesday, senior Australian officials defended their approach to dealing with China on the detention of Mr. Hu, even as they continued to complain publicly about what they called Beijing\u2019s unwillingness to share information about the case.\nThe Australian government said it had received no formal briefing on the allegations, despite several meetings between envoys in both countries. Instead, Australian officials said they had been forced to rely on Chinese newspapers and government Web sites or details.\nMr. Rudd, who normally talks frequently with the press, has gone on vacation and left most of the talking to deputies, although he has say that Australia will take a step-by-step approach in dealing with China. On Tuesday, he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he would raise the matter to \u201cwhatever level of Chinese government is necessary.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Foreign Minister Stephen Smith told ABC that he had \u201cmade it crystal clear, as have our officials, that I would have much preferred that this information be given to us through the normal diplomatic channels.\u201d But he also said the government would continue to pursue the case in a \u201cmethodical, sensible, rational way\u201d that was \u201cproportionate in the circumstances.\u201d\n.\nIn the absence of concrete details about the accusations against the Rio Tinto employees, there has been speculation here that the detentions were retaliation for Rio Tinto\u2019s cancellation last month of a planned investment by Chinalco, a state-owned Chinese company. The deal, which would have effectively expanded Chinalco\u2019s 9.3 percent stake in Rio to more than 18 percent, had drawn stiff political opposition in Australia, where mineral wealth is important to the economy and where some have begun to fear China\u2019s power in the region.\n\u201cThe fact that the Chinese have arrested Mr. Hu on claims of espionage rather than under corporate larceny or something else speaks volumes about the Chinese intentionally making a diplomatic incident out of this,\u201d said John Lee, a specialist in Chinese foreign policy with the Center for Independent Studies, a policy organization in Sydney.\nHe and another analyst, Brendan Taylor, a China expert at the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the Australian National University, said the Australian government\u2019s restrained approach was the country\u2019s best bet for making progress in the case.\n\u201cI think Rudd is handling it appropriately at this juncture, by taking a more indirect approach, trying not to politicize the issue,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cThe point where this becomes problematic from an Australia-China perspective is the point where Rudd feels compelled to respond because of domestic political pressure.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/world/asia/15australia.html", "title": "Cautious Move to Free Detained Executive in China", "author": "MERAIAH FOLEY"}

The increase in the number of deadly attacks on American forces may be related to the deadline of June 30, when the Iraqi-American security agreement signed last year dictates that coalition forces are to withdraw from the cities.\nBut Mosul is in many ways an exception to that deadline. An enormous American base on the edge of Mosul \u2014 a city that has remained a redoubt for the insurgency even as attacks have decreased substantially around the rest of Iraq \u2014 will remain open.\nTwo Iraqi soldiers were shot and killed in another part of Mosul on Friday, Iraqi police officials said. Nineveh, of which Mosul is capital, is one of two provinces in Iraq that have remained steadily violent as the country has calmed. The other is Diyala, northwest of Baghdad, where a string of deadly attacks occurred on Friday; at least nine people were killed.\nOne bomb went off in a minibus in a large bus depot, killing 5 and wounding 11, several of them women and children, local security officials said. Another, which exploded in a car, killed two children and injured two others.\nA third bomb, which was attached to a motorbike, killed one and injured seven, including a leader of one of the Awakening Councils, the Sunni armed groups that are paid by the government to fight insurgents.\nBut several Awakening members have been killed recently in Diyala, and a number have also been arrested as Iraqi security forces conduct a major security operation in the province.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/world/middleeast/30iraq.html", "title": "U.S. Soldier and 11 Iraqis Die in Attacks", "author": "CAMPBELL ROBERTSON"}
{"date": "Tue, 06 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BAGHDAD \u2014 It was a cool winter morning in Baghdad on Monday, just a few miles from the Shiite mosque where a suicide bomber killed or wounded 112 people the day before. But Abdul Kareem, 50, a real estate developer and independent Shiite candidate, was on the street hustling for votes anyway, passing out campaign cards and gluing his posters to walls.\n\u201cIf you think I\u2019m a good man, campaign for me,\u201d Mr. Kareem told an elderly man, handing him a stack of laminated cards.\nThe nation\u2019s provincial elections on Jan. 31 are the first in which the government has deemed it safe enough for the names, instead of simply the political affiliations, of officeseekers to appear on the ballot.\nIt is also the first time that large numbers of candidates like Mr. Kareem have decided for themselves that Iraq is sufficiently safe to campaign publicly and put their oversize pictures on posters and banners around the city. It sometimes seems that every square inch of blast wall in Baghdad is covered with them.\nThe elections are part of a series of votes scheduled in Iraq this year, including parliamentary elections and a referendum on the withdrawal of American forces. Taken together, they are expected to shape the political future of Iraq as it emerges from an extended period of sectarian violence and continues to wrestle with such basic questions as whether it will be a single nation or several.\nThe provincial election also takes place against the backdrop of a wave of departing foreign troops, most significantly from Britain and the United States. The United States has agreed to pull its combat troops, now numbering about 145,000, from cities by June 30, and to withdraw entirely from Iraq by the end of 2011.\nProvincial councils are roughly the equivalent of state legislatures in the United States, and the balloting for them is expected to correct underrepresentation in local governments among Sunni Arabs, particularly in areas where there has been heavy insurgent and sectarian violence, including Baghdad, Anbar, Diyala and Nineveh Provinces. Sunni Arabs largely boycotted the 2005 provincial elections.\nThere is widespread fear, however, that the vote may set off a new round of clashes. At least one candidate has been assassinated by political rivals and a number of opposition candidates have been arrested, several of whom are being investigated for terrorism-related charges in Diyala.\nThe election will be delayed in the restive Kirkuk Province, where some 40 percent of Iraq\u2019s oil reserves lie, and in the three provinces of Kurdistan, a semiautonomous region.\nFurther complicating the vote are the estimated 5.1 million Iraqis who remain displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration. Only about half of the refugees \u2014 those still living within Iraq\u2019s borders \u2014 are eligible to vote.\nThe provincial elections could prove to be a referendum on the religious parties that have dominated Iraqi politics in recent years, including Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\u2019s Islamic Dawa Party.\n\u201cThere is widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of the governing religious parties, but Maliki is clearly trying to mitigate this by playing the nationalist and centrist card,\u201d said Reidar Visser, a research fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs in Oslo, who runs www.historiae.org, a Web site focused on Iraqi affairs.\nWhile Mr. Maliki is not running, his Dawa Party has organized a group of political organizations into a coalition called State of Law, which is playing down Dawa\u2019s Shiite roots and emphasizing improved security, nationalism and economic development.\nDuring interviews across Iraq during the past two weeks, voters said they associated the nation\u2019s sectarian violence with the rise of religious parties. Provincial governments had done little, they said, to provide basic services like electricity. Now, four years after a raised purple index finger became a symbol of Iraqi democracy, the hope that a single vote could restore peace and order has been replaced by a fatalism common in far older democracies.\n\u201cI won\u2019t participate in the election, because those whom we elected last time failed us,\u201d said Iman Karkaz, a 50-year-old academic from the war-torn city of Falluja. \u201cMost of the parties used religion and Islam as a cover and then created sectarianism and riot in our society.\u201d\nThe government has sought to limit the influence of religion for the provincial elections by prohibiting appeals for candidates in mosques and other places of worship and by barring political signs with pictures of religious figures \u2014 strategies that religious parties employed in previous elections with great success.\nTwo of the nation\u2019s most influential Shiite clerics, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the reclusive 78-year-old cleric revered by many of Iraq\u2019s 15 million Shiites, and Moktada al-Sadr, 35, whose armed supporters have clashed with American and Iraqi forces in the past, have said they plan to stay largely neutral during the elections.\nInstead of attaching his name to a slate of candidates as in previous elections, Mr. Sadr, whose standing is far weaker than it was during the 2005 elections, said he might endorse only specific candidates this time.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to lose the trust of the people by politicizing the provincial councils,\u201d said Salah al-Obeidi, a spokesman for Mr. Sadr.\nIt may be too late. Karrar Ali, a 28-year old laborer from Maysan Province in heavily Shiite southern Iraq, which continues to be Mr. Sadr\u2019s base of support, said he planned to vote only for candidates running on secular platforms.\n\u201cI won\u2019t elect any of the religious lists,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lists that think art is forbidden, that sports are forbidden and that freedom of expression is forbidden won\u2019t be elected by me because it ties me up with the chains I\u2019ve always been with, and I want to be free now from those chains.\u201d\nThere are other signs that voters have grown tired of Iraq\u2019s politics.\nIn a government poll of 3,000 eligible Iraqi voters in November, nearly one-third said they supported the idea of a single-party state, and a 46 percent plurality said the existing provincial councils had done a poor job. Still, 75 percent of respondents said they were optimistic about Iraq\u2019s future, and 69 percent said they intended to vote.\nBut while religious parties may not fare as well as they have in past elections, analysts said their access to money, their grip on local and national seats and their ability to form political coalitions will virtually guarantee them a large following in the provincial contests.\nAnd some voters say Iraq needs Islam to help bind it together.\n\u201cWe\u2019re an Islamic country that will never accept a person who distributes immoral alcohol and urges our sons to be effeminate,\u201d said Kareem al-Muhammadawi, a 57-year-old taxi driver from Maysan Province.\nThe government, which has budgeted $225 million for the election, has made a major push to match the 63 percent turnout of the 2005 local elections \u2014 which were held on the same day as balloting for the National Assembly.\nAnd in an effort to avoid fraud, 46,000 nonpartisan election observers and thousands of other monitors will be allowed inside polling stations.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/world/middleeast/07election.html", "title": "This Time, Iraqis Hear and See Candidates", "author": "TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and SUADAD AL-SALHY"}

Indeed, tensions between the camps remain high, with the deposed president threatening to sneak back into the country and the de facto government enforcing a curfew after warning that armed groups were planning a rebellion.\nThe negotiator, President \u00d3scar Arias of Costa Rica, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said both sides had agreed to some form of unity government that would include members of all political parties and serve as a check on presidential powers. Fears that the deposed president, Manuel Zelaya, was trying to subvert the Constitution and extend his tenure were a driving force behind his ouster last month.\nThe two sides have also agreed to amnesty, Mr. Arias said, both for those who ousted Mr. Zelaya and for Mr. Zelaya himself, who has been threatened with arrest if he returns to Honduras. The de facto government of Honduras says Mr. Zelaya was legally removed based on a warrant for his arrest. But nations around the world, whether through the United Nations General Assembly or the Organization of American States, have denounced his ouster as an illegal coup.\nRoberto Micheletti, the interim president in Honduras\u2019s de facto government, said Wednesday that he would step down, but not if Mr. Zelaya returned to power. Mr. Arias dismissed that option, saying there would be no agreement without the president\u2019s reinstatement, even if it meant Mr. Zelaya went back with significantly limited powers. Both sides have agreed, however, to invite international monitors to watch over the next presidential elections, which are scheduled for November, Mr. Arias said.\nDespite the gulf that remains over Mr. Zelaya\u2019s return to power, Mr. Arias said that he expected \u201csome significant advances\u201d when talks resume this weekend in Costa Rica, though he cautioned that whatever ground had been reached could dissolve. The first round of negotiations got off to a shaky start last week, when Mr. Zelaya and Mr. Micheletti left hours after they began and never met face to face.\nHundreds of Zelaya supporters blocked highways in Honduras on Thursday, as Patricia Rodas, the former foreign minister under Mr. Zelaya, said the ousted president was \u201con his way\u201d back to the country, without specifying when or how he would enter, The Associated Press reported.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/world/americas/17honduras.html", "title": "Some Terms Reached in Honduras Dispute", "author": "GINGER THOMPSON"}

Houseal, a 54-year-old psychiatrist and father of seven in the Army Reserve, was there to counsel, having requested an Iraq deployment to support soldiers struggling with the heartache and hardship of war.\nPfc. Michael E. Yates, 19, was there to talk, perhaps about the pain he was feeling about being separated from his girlfriend and infant son, relatives said.\nAnd Sgt. John M. Russell, 44, was there because he had to be. After 15 years in the Army, he had fallen into debt and out of favor with his commanding officer, who took away his weapon and sent him for counseling.\nIt was in that clinic, a low-slung building at Camp Liberty on the outskirts of Baghdad, that Sergeant Russell used a weapon that he seized from an escort last Monday to shoot and kill Major Houseal, Private Yates and three other people, Army officials say. He has been charged with five counts of murder in the deadliest case of soldier-on-soldier violence involving the American military in the six-year Iraq war.\nThat the shootings, which remain under investigation, happened in a clinic intended to be a quiet oasis from combat has in no small way underscored how stressful the nation\u2019s two wars have become for its stretched military forces.\nArmy studies and surveys show that multiple deployments and long deployments contribute to higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and marital problems. And soldiers on their third or fourth deployment are at significantly higher risk than soldiers on their first or second ones for mental health problems and work-related problems, according to the Army Mental Health Advisory Team Report released last year.\nThough it is far from clear what motivated the shootings, the Army announced last week that it would undertake extensive reviews of whether it was providing adequate mental health services for troops in Iraq.\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve learned anything in this war,\u201d Maj. Gen. Daniel P. Bolger said in Iraq last week, \u201cis that, you know, not all injuries are physical.\u201d\nThe clinic, known as a restoration center, is where troops can go for counseling, classes, therapy or rest, whether at their own volition or on orders. Within its air-conditioned environs are a lounge equipped with chairs and board games and a residential area where troops can stay for up to four days. Private rooms are available for individual therapy or group classes in anxiety and anger management, smoking cessation or sleep hygiene.\nSergeant Russell, of the 54th Engineering Battalion based in Bamberg, Germany, may have received counseling from a chaplain, Army officials said, but his commanders determined that he needed more intensive care. Precisely what prompted those concerns is unclear, but his friends and family said that he had grown increasingly disenchanted with the Army and anxious about his future in it.\nIn an interview with a television station in Sherman, Tex., Sergeant Russell\u2019s father said his son had a learning disability and had problems holding good jobs before he joined first the National Guard in 1988 and then the active duty Army in 1994.\nBut that career seemed in jeopardy, Sergeant Russell recently told his father, because of tensions with his commanding officer, and the sergeant feared he was being sent for counseling as a prelude to being drummed out. The Army, Wilburn Russell said, was his son\u2019s \u201cwhole identity.\u201d\nLosing his job would effectively end his chances of receiving a military pension, Mr. Russell said, and Sergeant Russell could little afford that: he had fallen behind on the $1,500 per month mortgage payments on a house he bought in Sherman.\nThere were other pressures. Sergeant Russell\u2019s father-in-law was \u201cdying of cancer,\u201d and a cyst had been found on the liver of his 20-year-old son by a previous marriage, Mr. Russell said.\n\u201cAll these things weigh on him,\u201d Mr. Russell told KXII, a North Texas station.\nThough Mr. Russell described his son as \u201cthe most stable guy in the world,\u201d two men who served alongside Sergeant Russell said he was unhappy with Army life.\nMichael Hanna, who served with Sergeant Russell in Ramadi in 2005 and 2006, described him as largely keeping to himself, smoking and watching bootleg DVDs in his spare time. A communications specialist, he was frequently criticized by his superiors and berated by younger soldiers who assumed that he had been passed over for promotion, said Mr. Hanna, now a civilian.\n\u201cThere was never one uplifting conversation that I have ever had with that guy,\u201d Mr. Hanna said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t saying, \u2018I\u2019m gonna kill myself.\u2019 It\u2019s just a general, \u2018I hate this place,\u2019 times 10.\u201d\nIt is unclear whether Sergeant Russell had gone to the clinic before the shooting. But if he had, he might have seen one of the two men who were killed there last week, Major Houseal and Cmdr. Charles K. Springle, a licensed clinical social worker.\nBoth men had spent time in their home communities helping returning troops and veterans with mental health problems, Major Houseal as a psychiatrist for Texas Panhandle Mental Health Mental Retardation in Amarillo and Commander Springle as director of the Community Counseling Center at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. In his free time, Commander Springle, 52, also advised health care workers in dealing with post-traumatic stress syndrome among reservists.\nMajor Houseal had served in the Navy years ago but joined the Army Reserve in 2007 and volunteered to go to Iraq, friends said. It was typical behavior from a man who had been swift to offer aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina and was known to fly himself to remote parts of the Panhandle to treat indigent patients.\n\u201cThe irony is, Dr. Houseal and those others were there to help,\u201d said Edward Schertler III, executive director of the Panhandle organization. \u201cIt\u2019s just tragic.\u201d\nPrivate Yates, one of three enlisted men who died at the clinic, was among the people Dr. Houseal might have tried to help.\nPrivate Yates, of Federalsburg, Md., came from a military family: a brother and sister had served, as had his stepfather. Though he seemed to take to the Army at first, he struggled when he returned to Iraq after a home leave last month, deeply missing his girlfriend and 1-year-old son, his sister said. So he took himself to the clinic, relatives said.\n\u201cJust had a great conversation with the girl of my dreams,\u201d Private Yates wrote on his MySpace page on May 9, two days before the shooting. \u201cBaby you mean so much to me i miss you and cant wait to come home to you.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/world/middleeast/17clinic.html", "title": "Among 5 Killed, a Mender of Heartache and a Struggling Private", "author": "JAMES DAO and PAUL von ZIELBAUER"}

McChrystal, said the use of airstrikes during firefights would in most cases be allowed only to prevent American and other coalition troops from being overrun.\nEven in the cases of active firefights with Taliban forces, he said, airstrikes will be limited if the combat is taking place in populated areas \u2014 the very circumstances in which most Afghan civilian deaths have occurred. The restrictions will be especially tight in attacking houses and compounds where insurgents are believed to have taken cover.\n\u201cAir power contains the seeds of our own destruction if we do not use it responsibly,\u201d General McChrystal told a group of his senior officers during a video conference last week. \u201cWe can lose this fight.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we shoot into a compound, that should only be for the protection of our forces,\u201d he said. \u201cI want everyone to understand that.\u201d\nThe statements by General McChrystal signaled the latest tightening of the rules for using airstrikes, which, while considered indispensable for protecting troops, have killed hundreds of civilians.\nThey have also angered the Afghan government, which has repeatedly criticized American and NATO forces for not taking enough care with civilian lives.\nIn December, the American commander at the time, Gen. David D. McKiernan, issued guidelines ordering his soldiers to use force that was proportional to the provocation and that minimized the risk of civilian casualties.\nGeneral McChrystal\u2019s new guidelines follow a deadly episode last month in the Afghan village of Granai, where American airstrikes killed dozens of civilians.\nThe episode highlighted the difficulties facing American officers under fire, as they are forced to balance using lethal force to protect their troops with rules restricting the use of firepower to prevent civilian deaths.\nThe episode, on May 4, began when a large group of Taliban fighters attacked a group of about 200 Afghan soldiers and police officers and American advisers. During the firefight, which began just after noon and carried on into the night, the Americans on the ground called for air support.\nAmerican fighter jets, and then bombers, came to the scene, dropping a number of 500- and 2,000-pound bombs. The bombs succeeded in ending the attack, but they did much more damage as well.\nA Pentagon report estimated that at least 26 civilians had been killed in the airstrikes. It concluded that American personnel had made significant errors, including violating procedures, that led to those deaths. Among those errors, the report said, was a failure by the American personnel to discern whether Afghan civilians were in the compound before they attacked.\nOther credible estimates of civilian deaths in Granai ranged much higher. An investigation by a Kabul-based group, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, said that at least 86 women and children had been killed, and as many as 97 civilians altogether. The Afghan government said 140 civilians had been killed.\nThe Pentagon report did not dispute the conclusions reached by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, and referred to its \u201cbalanced, thorough investigation.\u201d\nThe deaths in Granai make up part of the huge rise in civilian casualties that are characterizing the war in Afghanistan.\nA United Nations report found that the number of Afghan civilians killed in 2008 was 40 percent higher than in 2007. The Taliban and other insurgents caused the majority of the civilian deaths, primarily through suicide bombers and roadside bombs.\nThe changes highlighted by General McChrystal go to the heart of what went wrong in Granai. In that case, there were at least four airstrikes: the first by F-18 fighters and the other three by a B-1B bomber. The report found that it was the last two airstrikes that probably caused the civilian deaths.\nIn those cases, the report found, the bomber\u2019s crew tracked suspected Taliban fighters as they entered a building, and then attacked without determining whether civilians were inside. The report said there were probably civilians inside those buildings when they were destroyed.\nUnder the rules that General McChrystal outlined, those strikes would almost certainly be prohibited. They would be prohibited, the general said, even if it meant letting some Taliban get away.\nReferring to airstrikes, General McChrystal said, \u201cIf it is just to defeat the enemy, then we are not going to do it, even if it means we are going to step away from that firefight and fight another time.\u201d\nAccording to the Pentagon report, the B-1B dropped five 500-pound bombs and two 2,000-pound bombs. The initial airstrikes, carried out by four F-18 fighters-bombers, the report said, killed insurgents but no civilians.\nAhmad Nader Nadery, the director of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, said Sunday that the American response in Granai was \u201cdisproportionate.\u201d And he said he was pleased by the changes outlined by General McChrystal.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to seeing the new guidelines, and actually seeing how they would be translated into practice,\u201d he said.\nLast September, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates ordered new rules specifically to defuse tensions over Afghan civilian deaths.\nDuring a recent visit to Kabul, Mr. Gates said the American military would quickly apologize and offer compensation to survivors in cases of civilian deaths, even in advance of formal investigations to determine exactly what had happened.\n\u201cI think the key for us is, on those rare occasions when we do make a mistake, when there is an error, to apologize quickly, to compensate the victims quickly, and then carry out the investigation,\u201d Mr. Gates said after a meeting with President Hamid Karzai.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/world/asia/22airstrikes.html", "title": "U.S. Tightens Airstrike Policy in Afghanistan", "author": "DEXTER FILKINS"}

A few hours later, most of the unit\u2019s 500 soldiers surrendered, and several of their commanders were detained.\nPresident Mikheil Saakashvili said Russia was hoping to derail the NATO exercises, which he called a \u201csymbolic event.\u201d\n\u201cWe are asking our northern neighbor to refrain from any provocations,\u201d he said of Russia, in a televised interview.\nRussia immediately denied any role in the unrest.\n\u201cThis is not the first time we have been accused of interference without evidence,\u201d a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. \u201cWe would like to reiterate that Russia, as a matter of principle, doesn\u2019t interfere in Georgia\u2019s domestic affairs.\u201d\nThe exchange raised the already high temperature of regional relations in advance of the exercises, run by NATO\u2019s Partnership for Peace program, which includes nonmembers of the alliance. NATO has described the plan as routine and small-scale \u2014 around 1,000 soldiers will take part in field exercises \u2014 but Russia complains that, less than a year after its war with Georgia, any NATO training there is provocative.\nArmenia, Serbia and Kazakhstan have said they will pull out of the exercises in solidarity with Russia. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia notified NATO on Tuesday that it was pulling out of a long-anticipated NATO-Russia Council meeting scheduled for May 19 in Brussels, in protest of the exercises and of NATO\u2019s expulsion of two Russian diplomats on suspicion of spying.\nCarmen Romero, a NATO spokeswoman, said Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer regretted Russia\u2019s decision and hoped to reschedule the meeting soon. She said the exercises would go on as scheduled.\nDmitri O. Rogozin, Russia\u2019s envoy to NATO, warned that the exercises might \u201csignificantly affect the stability of the entire South Caucasus.\u201d\n\u201cHow can one insist on these exercises with such stubbornness and persistence?\u201d he said, in comments broadcast in Russia. \u201cIf these exercises were held at NATO\u2019s insistence in some psychiatric hospital, it would be a much more adequate decision than holding them on the territory of the Georgian state.\u201d\nDetails of the Georgian mutiny emerged throughout the day.\nShota Utiashvili, a top official in Georgia\u2019s Interior Ministry, said authorities learned at 6:30 a.m. that a tank battalion stationed at Mukhrovani \u2014 five miles from the site of the planned military exercises \u2014 had publicly announced a mutiny. He said the unit\u2019s 500 soldiers had sealed off the base and would not allow Defense Ministry officials to enter.\n\u201cWhat happened is that battalion commanders told the soldiers that the Russians were attacking them and they had to take combat positions,\u201d Mr. Utiashvili said. Around noon, he said, the soldiers learned from news reports that their commanders had misled them and surrendered. Authorities were relieved to discover that the mutiny was small and isolated, he said.\nIn the morning, officials confidently asserted a Russian hand in the plan, but by afternoon they were more cautious. Mr. Utiashvili said it was \u201cnot exactly clear\u201d whether the accused plotters had Russian support.\n\u201cTo have a legally sound case we need more information,\u201d he said. \u201cThis morning we had some evidence, and from that evidence one would follow that Russia was involved.\u201d\nIncriminating surveillance footage was broadcast all day on Georgian television. In one video, which had been edited, Gia Ghvaladze, a former major in the Georgian special forces, is shown describing plans to overthrow Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s government on behalf of Russia. Major Ghvaladze says the plan is to approach Tbilisi with a column of 250 troop carriers and backup from 5,000 Russian troops, and he talks about killing six of Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s closest advisers.\nHe was arrested Monday night on charges of organizing a mutiny. By Tuesday evening, the police had arrested 13 suspects, according to the Interior Ministry.\nThe unfolding events left much of Tbilisi spellbound \u2014 or paralyzed. Traffic thinned out on the city\u2019s streets, and when a professor named Natia Kuprashvili, 29, tried to teach her class at Tbilisi State University, her students\u2019 cellphones began to ring so wildly that she gave up and went in search of a television.\nBut in the end, she said, \u201cit is very hard to understand what really happened here.\u201d\nA Georgian named Roman Apakidze, 30, concluded that a mutiny had taken place, but that the government was distorting it for political purposes.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like the way the government is handling this information \u2014 it is real information terror against ordinary people, what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is better not to turn on the television at all.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/world/europe/06georgia.html", "title": "On Eve of NATO Exercise, Georgia Says It Foiled Mutiny", "author": "OLESYA VARTANYAN and ELLEN BARRY"}
{"date": "Wed, 11 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "THE HAGUE \u2014 Judges at the International Criminal Court have decided to issue an arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan, brushing aside diplomatic requests to allow more time for peace negotiations in the conflict-riddled Darfur region of his country, according to court lawyers and diplomats.\nIt is the first time the court has sought the detention of a sitting head of state, and it could further complicate the tense, international debate over how to solve the crisis in Darfur.\nEver since international prosecutors began seeking an arrest warrant last year, opponents have pressed the United Nations Security Council to use its power to suspend the proceedings. But a majority of Council members have argued that the case should go forward, saying Mr. Bashir has not done enough to stop the bloodshed to deserve a reprieve.\nMany African and Arab nations counter that issuing a warrant for Mr. Bashir\u2019s arrest could backfire, diminishing Sudan\u2019s willingness to compromise for the sake of peace. Others, including some United Nations officials, worry that a warrant could inspire reprisal attacks against civilians, aid groups or the thousands of international peacekeepers deployed there.\nThe precise charges cited by the judges against Mr. Bashir have not been disclosed. But when the court\u2019s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, first requested an arrest warrant in July, he said he had evidence to support charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide related to a military campaign that \u201cpurposefully targeted civilians\u201d and had been \u201cmasterminded\u201d by Mr. Bashir.\nLawyers familiar with the case said the court had already sought to freeze the president\u2019s assets but had found his possessions to be hidden behind other names.\nThe decision to issue a warrant against him, reached by a panel of judges in The Hague, has been conveyed to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and is expected to be formally announced at the court, officials at the United Nations said.\nThe prosecutor became involved in the case after the Security Council asked him to investigate the conflict in Darfur, where massacres, disease and starvation have led to the deaths of up to 300,000 people and driven millions from their homes.\nAlthough there has been sporadic fighting in Darfur for decades, the conflict significantly intensified in 2003, when rebel groups demanding greater autonomy for the region attacked Sudanese forces. The Arab-led government responded with a ferocious counterinsurgency campaign, which the court\u2019s prosecutor called a genocidal strategy against Darfur\u2019s black African ethnic groups.\nRelations between Mr. Ban and Mr. Bashir continue to be strained by Sudanese government actions in Darfur and by Mr. Ban\u2019s refusal to deal with Mr. Bashir directly.\nBut on Sunday the two men had an unscheduled encounter at a summit meeting in Ethiopia. Diplomats described it as \u201ca stormy meeting\u201d and \u201ca shouting match\u201d in which Mr. Bashir vented his anger at the court, though it is independent of the United Nations. Mr. Ban, in turn, insisted on the safety of United Nations staff members and peacekeepers, and demanded that Mr. Bashir stop the attacks on civilians.\nThe prospect of an arrest warrant for Mr. Bashir has already caused a diplomatic rift, with the African Union and members of the Arab League asking the Security Council to exercise its right to postpone any moves against the president for a year, arguing that he might still help bring a settlement in Darfur. Once an arrest warrant is issued, the Council can request that it be postponed.\nThere is broad concern that removing Mr. Bashir from power could threaten a landmark peace treaty between the Sudanese government and rebels in the southern part of the country. The treaty was signed in 2005 to end a civil war in which 2.2 million people died, far more than in Darfur.\nMr. Bashir fought members of his own party to approve that peace deal, and it is widely seen as critical to holding the country together.\nBut some diplomats said the peace treaty was not at risk, irrespective of Mr. Bashir, because others in the government want to keep the south stable to maintain access to the large oil deposits there.\nOn Wednesday, the Sudanese ambassador to the United Nations, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem, dismissed the court\u2019s decision as \u201cnot deserving the ink used to print it.\u201d The ambassador accused the court of being a political tool of mostly Western powers that want to fragment Sudan.\nMr. Abdalhaleem contended that in separate talks at the United Nations last fall with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and top European officials, Sudan was promised that Western powers would support a suspension of the prosecution if the country cooperated with United Nations peacekeeping efforts, pursued peace talks and more aggressively pursued war criminals.\n\u201cWe are moving on all those tracks,\u201d he said, though human rights groups and diplomats disagree.\nA top United Nations official said Mr. Ban\u2019s advisers were now struggling to forge a policy that supports the court\u2019s pursuit of justice but avoids wrecking Sudanese cooperation with the complex missions there.\nThe court has issued two other arrest warrants in connection with the Darfur conflict, one for a former government minister, Ahmad Harun, and another for Ali Kushayb, a leader of a government-backed militia. Neither has been arrested.\nThe prosecutor has also accused three rebel leaders of the killing of 12 African Union peacekeepers. They have said publicly that they will surrender to the court.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/africa/12hague.html", "title": "Judges Approve Warrant for Sudan\u2019s President", "author": "MARLISE SIMONS and NEIL MacFARQUHAR"}
{"date": "Tue, 13 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 As experts pore over ballots to determine whether the fraud in this country\u2019s presidential election was so big that a runoff vote was required, many Afghans interviewed here on Tuesday shared the same view: Why bother?\nIn shops, offices and bakeries around the capital, many Afghans said holding a second round of voting to designate a winner simply did not make sense.\nIt was not that they did not want a final result. Or that they thought the Aug. 20 election had been fraud-free. But years of disappointment in their government has hardened into cynicism, and many said a second round would only lead to another flawed result.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time and money,\u201d said Muhammad Hashem Haideri, a 52-year-old movie theater manager. \u201cIt would be useless.\u201d\nThe Afghans interviewed here are only a small sampling of opinion in this ethnic patchwork of a country. The largely Pashtun south supports the incumbent, President Hamid Karzai, who won 54 percent of the vote, enough to avoid a runoff, according to the preliminary tally. His supporters vigorously oppose more voting.\nBut parts of the north back Mr. Karzai\u2019s main opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, a Tajik. Many of his supporters say that their votes were stolen and want a second round. Mr. Abdullah won about 28 percent of the vote.\nStill, the ethnic jumble of Kabul \u2014 a dusty, sprawling city of four million whose horse carts and turbaned old men give it the feeling of a frontier town from a past century \u2014 provides a fairly broad reach even with a small sample of voices.\nZainab Hussein Zada, 21, a pharmacy student from Parwan Province, in central Afghanistan, said that she was disappointed by the messy result, but that it reflected the level of the country\u2019s democratic skills. Afghanistan, in other words, is not Switzerland, and it is unrealistic to expect it to behave in an election as if it were.\n\u201cIt was not very fair, and there were many mistakes, but this is the situation in our country,\u201d she said, sitting on a green bench outside the pharmacy department at Kabul University. \u201cIt\u2019s better just to accept this result.\u201d\nThat might seem cynical, considering the level of fraud, but it is a measure of how tired Afghans have become in recent years of the corruption that runs through their government. Their faith in politics is at a dismal low, which, in addition to fears about security, helped suppress voter turnout. A European Union team of observers has estimated that about a million of Mr. Karzai\u2019s votes were suspect.\nHabibullah Sarosh, 23, a fast-talking film student, said that in 2004 he waited in line for hours to cast his vote.\n\u201cI went to the polling station with a passion in my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought my vote would change the destiny of my country, but I was wrong.\u201d\nThis time, the polling station was empty, and Mr. Sarosh said he voted \u201cout of obligation.\u201d As for a potential second round, he said, \u201cIt won\u2019t solve our problems.\u201d\nSome said that getting to the second round would be a good exercise in democracy for Afghans. Mr. Karzai, they said, would be humbled, and his opposition would feel it had accomplished something.\nBut no one interviewed wanted to go through with the vote, and everyone offered suggestions about how to avoid it. Muhammad Sabur Hashemi, 36, a bridal shop owner, said Mr. Karzai and Mr. Abdullah should join in a coalition government. Mr. Haideri, the theater manager, said the United States government should choose.\n\u201cEverybody is dreaming of a good, competent government made by the United States and NATO,\u201d he said mournfully to the thumping beat of a Bollywood movie.\nAfghanistan\u2019s problem, he said, was its ethnic divisions.\n\u201cThe Afghan people are not mentally united,\u201d he said. \u201cAn Uzbek will never vote for a Tajik. A Tajik will never vote for a Pashtun.\u201d\nMuhammad Ghazi, a 21-year-old baker, had a different view, one far more common among Afghans: a belief that the United States would simply impose its own candidate.\n\u201cEven if every Afghan casts their vote for Abdullah, he won\u2019t be president because the foreigners don\u2019t want him to be,\u201d he said, slinging long flat slabs of Afghan bread at customers through a window. \u201cNobody respected the people\u2019s vote.\u201d\nMr. Haideri strongly disagreed. The election was Afghan, he said, and that was a major part of the problem. The government is a bitter disappointment, he said, particularly after the brutal years of civil war and Taliban rule that had left his theater looking like, in his words, \u201ca trash can.\u201d\n\u201cWe are watching people with no education become ministers with luxury cars and many houses,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me feel very sad.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/world/asia/14afghan.html", "title": "In Kabul, Little Hope That a Runoff Will Be Fair", "author": "SABRINA TAVERNISE"}

But since Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, relations with Turkey, Israel\u2019s closest Muslim ally, have become strained.\nIsrael\u2019s Arab allies stood behind it in the war, but Turkey, a NATO member whose mediating efforts last year brought Israel into indirect talks with Syria, protested every step of the way in a month of angry remarks capped when Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan stalked off the stage during a debate in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 29.\nIn the week since, both sides have taken pains to mend fences, with officials in Israel and Turkey making conciliatory statements.\n\u201cTurkey and Israel attribute a special importance to their bilateral relations,\u201d Turkey\u2019s deputy prime minister, Cemil Cicek, said this week. \u201cWe want to protect our relations with this country.\u201d\nBut both sides acknowledge that some damage has been done, and while the full implications for the relationship are still unknown, many political analysts say they sense a shift.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a business-as-usual relationship anymore,\u201d said Cengiz Candar, a columnist for Radikal, a Turkish daily. \u201cIt\u2019s a very uneasy sort of cohabitation in this region now.\u201d\nTurkey is unique in the Middle East for its robust relations with Israel. It was the first Muslim country to recognize Israel as a state, and it has built up more than $3 billion in annual trade with Israel, far more than for any other Middle Eastern country.\nMr. Erdogan encouraged the relationship, visiting Israel in 2005 with a group of Turkish businessmen and becoming the first Turkish prime minister to visit the office of Turkey\u2019s chief rabbi after a synagogue was bombed in 2003.\nBut when it comes to Hamas, which controls Gaza, they disagree. Israel views it as a terrorist group and focuses on its doctrinal commitment to destroy the Zionist state. Mr. Erdogan sees other aspects: Hamas began as a grass-roots Islamic movement, and like his own Justice and Development party, also Islamic-inspired, was democratically elected against overwhelming odds.\n\u201cThey identified with some parts of the Hamas story,\u201d said Femi Koru, a columnist for Today\u2019s Zaman, a Turkish newspaper. \u201cThey were also outcasts who were not allowed to join national politics.\u201d\nTurkish officials argue that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s stance against the war was simply healthy criticism \u2014 words of warning from a close friend who sincerely believed that Israel had gone too far.\n\u201cTurkey has lost its patience with the status quo in the Mideast,\u201d said a senior Turkish official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. \u201cGaza is the bankruptcy of the military solution.\u201d\nThe official added, \u201cIsrael is there to stay, and Palestinians are there to stay, and they need to be talking right now.\u201d\nIsrael, for its part, feels that Mr. Erdogan is no longer a disinterested party in the peace process, and though the two countries will remain allies, the trust is no longer as strong.\n\u201cHe has burned all the bridges with Jerusalem,\u201d said one senior Israeli official, who spoke anonymously because of the delicacy of the issue. \u201cHe won\u2019t be seen as an honest broker anymore.\u201d\nWhile Israel said it went to war to end rocket fire by Hamas, Mr. Erdogan said he saw the war through the prism of democracy.\n\u201cThe world has not respected the will of the Palestinian people,\u201d he said in an interview with Newsweek on Jan. 31. \u201cOn the one hand, we defend democracy and we try our best to keep democracy in the Middle East, but on the other we do not respect the outcome.\u201d\nHe also rejects Hamas\u2019s use of violence. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Hamas is a good organization and makes no mistakes,\u201d he said.\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s stance has won him praise in Arab societies, which opposed Israel\u2019s military campaign and chafe at their leaders\u2019 support of it.\n\u201cIn one stroke, he became the moral patron saint of the Arab world,\u201d said Mr. Candar, the columnist. But some Turkish columnists criticized Mr. Erdogan for what they said was an implicit hypocrisy \u2014 raising the issue of the Israeli killings of Palestinians while failing to mention his own country\u2019s abuses in the mostly Kurdish southeast during years of war there.\n\u201cOne would naturally ask Erdogan, who stands up against violence imposed on people in Gaza, what he thinks about Kurds being killed in his own country,\u201d wrote Ahmet Altan in the liberal Turkish daily Taraf.\nThe fallout has affected Israeli tourism to Turkey, which is down in recent weeks, according to Avi Mendelbaum of Unital, a Tel Aviv travel agency. He said that his agency alone could fill a plane of 180 tourists going to Turkey a year ago, but that this year five agencies have joined to fill the same flight. The economic crisis is partly responsible, he said, but other destinations have not been hit as badly.\nBut Israelis make up less than 2 percent of Turkey\u2019s tourism industry, and it would be far more serious if there were repercussions in the United States, where Jewish groups have helped Turkey block a resolution that condemns the genocide of a more than a million Ottoman Empire Armenians from being discussed in Congress.\nAbraham H. Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League, said that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s criticism was \u201clike a shock to the system,\u201d but added that the league had not changed its opposition to the genocide bill in Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of punishment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake in the relationship.\u201d\nAs for charges that anti-Semitism is flaring in Turkey, Mr. Foxman said it was no worse than in any other country.\nThough Turkey\u2019s role as a mediator in the Middle East might suffer, the broader relationship will not, analysts said.

{"date": "Tue, 05 May 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The men, hollow-eyed and matted, start coming at dawn, shuffling into the remains of the old Soviet Cultural Center, which in its day staged films celebrating the glories of a new era.\nThese days, the shell of the abandoned building serves as perhaps the world\u2019s largest gathering spot for men looking to satisfy their lust for heroin and opium. Stooping in the darkened caverns of the place, amid the waste and exhalations of hundreds of others, the men partake of the drug that has begun to wreak its deathly magic in the very country where it is produced.\nOne such man, who called himself Mohammed Ofzal, struck a match beneath a piece of foil and sucked in the blue smoke that rose from the liquefying little mass. Then he sat back in a crouch, legs shaking a little. His eyes, glazed and half-shut, stared blankly at the floor.\n\u201cMy parents are fed up with me; they are telling me to quit,\u201d Mr. Ofzal said. He said he was 18. His clothes, unlike nearly everyone else\u2019s in the gathering post, were pressed and clean. He said he would go home soon; he would not be spending the night. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take care of yourself, you could die here.\u201d\nAround him were a hundred other men, some crouching, some collapsed, some unconscious; some, perhaps, were dead. The visitors, though not the denizens, covered their faces from the smell. Mr. Ofzal lit another match and bent down to drink in the smoke.\nAfghanistan, the world\u2019s largest producer of opium, is drowning in a sea of its own making. While the country\u2019s narco-traffickers ship vast quantities of the stuff to Europe and the United States, enough of it stays behind to offer a cheap and easy temptation to the people at home. A United Nations survey taken four years ago revealed 200,000 opium and heroin addicts in a population of about 35 million; a new study, to be completed in the summer, is expected to show even more.\nAddiction in Afghanistan is rising along with the country\u2019s opium production, which is cranking at something close to fever pitch. With much of its society and many of its institutions ruined by 30 years of fighting, Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world\u2019s opium. The money earned from narcotics accounts for more than half of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. It feeds the Taliban insurgency.\nThe Soviet Culture Center is the most public of arenas in which to view the trade\u2019s depredations on ordinary people. (For the men, that is; the center, like virtually every other public place in Afghanistan, is strictly segregated by sex.) The building sits in the Dehamatzang neighborhood of western Kabul, the scene of ferocious and prolonged fighting during the civil war that engulfed the country in the 1990s. The exterior walls are crumbled and pockmarked with bullet holes.\nInside is a landscape of extraordinary human wreckage. The rooms resemble catacombs; lightless and fetid and crammed with dozens, even hundreds, of bodies, each one clinging to his bit of space, his bit of elixir. Clouds of blue smoke rise, linger and dissolve. Almost no one speaks. In a corner, a man, seated on the floor, offers candy and cigarettes. In an ordinary day, 2,000 men pass through here. That\u2019s on top of the nearly 600 who never leave. \u201cDid you bring any money?\u201d one of the men asked, as hunched and withered as a gargoyle.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said another, slipping his friend a tiny packet.\nNext to them a body slumped in an improbable pose \u2014 curled, stiff, yet balanced, delicately, as if on the head of a pin. After a time the body fell over, as frozen as before. No one looked up.\nMen and boys are not the only people who have fallen prey to the drug; women and girls are merely harder to find. Typically, females, prohibited from wandering the streets, stay indoors, which mitigates their helplessness but shields them from help.\nA woman named Aziza, for instance, lives at home with her six children, who range in age from 18 months to 21. Aziza, who like many Afghans has only one name, is a gaunt and reduced figure, possibly beautiful once, but now a woman of papery skin and sunken cheeks and eyes sunk deep in her skull. For Aziza, as for many here, smoking opium is a way to escape a life without hope.\nTwo years ago, Aziza\u2019s husband died in a car accident, and with no way of supporting her family on her own \u2014 women in this deeply conservative society do not generally work outside the home \u2014 she fell into despair. One day, a friend offered her a pipe and opium. She took it. Since then, Aziza has been smoking two or three times a day, sometimes in front of her children.\n\u201cOpium has been a good friend to me; it has taken away my sorrows,\u201d Aziza said, seated in the corner of her one-room house, with her children looking on.\nKabul contains a tiny handful of clinics that treat drug abuse, but they have nowhere near the capacity to treat the number of people in need. About six months ago, the counselors from one clinic, alerted by the neighbors, found Aziza in her home and invited her to the clinic. Aziza stayed for 24 hours.\n\u201cWhen I need it, it is a kind of an attack,\u201d she said afterward. \u201cI can\u2019t resist the opium; it is stronger than I am.\u201d\nWith her children standing by, Aziza reached into a cloth bag and produced a filthy spoon, a bit of powder and a straw. Her 6-year-old son, Mirwais, stood to his mother\u2019s left, 10-year-old Sonia stood to her right. Aziza, eyes glazed, struck a match but could produce no spark. She tried again and failed. Finally, Sonia took the box from her mother\u2019s hands, struck a flame and handed the match to her mother.\nAziza bent over and breathed in the blue smoke.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/world/asia/06kabul.html", "title": "Drugs Hollow Out Afghan Lives in Cultural Center", "author": "DEXTER FILKINS"}

It said Google had already been warned twice, in January and April, about its content.\nOn Friday evening, the associative-word feature of the Web site appeared to have been disabled. That is the function that displays a drop-down menu of words related to a search word that is typed into the search engine. The previous evening, reporters on China Central Television, the state television network, showed how typing in the Chinese word for son, erzi, could pull up associated terms that have lewd connotations.\nState news organizations said the ability to use Google\u2019s Chinese site to search overseas Web sites was supposed to have been disabled, but that feature was working Friday evening.\nGoogle released a statement saying it was making greater efforts to clean up its Chinese Web site. \u201cWe have been continually working to deal with pornographic content, and material that is harmful to children, on the Web in China,\u201d the statement said.\nRecent efforts by the Chinese government to limit access to the Internet have outraged Chinese computer users. The strongest reaction has been to the government\u2019s plan to force computer makers to install Internet censorship software on all computers sold in China after July 1. Critics say the software, called Green Dam-Youth Escort, could be used to censor Web sites with content deemed politically unacceptable, even though the government says its main use will be to block access to pornography.\nComputer experts say the software can make a computer vulnerable to hackers. This week, developers said they had found solutions to the problems. But on Friday, J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan, said that a patched version of Green Dam had a security problem as serious as the original one.\nIn a paper posted on the Internet, Mr. Halderman said he and his research team found the new problem in only an hour. In an e-mail message, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be impossible to make the software safe enough ahead of the July 1 deadline.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/world/asia/20beijing.html", "title": "China Disables Some Google Functions", "author": "EDWARD WONG"}

Thousands of teenage boys and their farmer fathers are grabbing machetes, slingshots, axes and ragtag shotguns, wading into the bush to confront a band of experienced killers.\nThey bang on drums to signal to one another. They patrol at night in shifts. Already, several members of these so-called self-defense forces have been killed. And in Congo\u2019s recent past, the advent of local militias has only led to more bloodshed and abuses.\nBut here, the people feel they have no choice.\n\u201cThis is our land,\u201d said \u00c9tienne Dalafada, one of the self-proclaimed militia leaders.\nMr. Dalafada and his comrades said they had been abandoned by the Congolese National Army and the United Nations peacekeepers based in Congo, who failed to stop the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army from recently slaughtering nearly 1,000 civilians.\nThe rebels are originally from Uganda but have been hiding out in a national park near Faradje for the past several years. In mid-December, the Ugandan Army, helped by a team of American military advisers and several thousand Congolese troops, tried to crush the rebels. Instead, most of the fighters escaped and vented their rage on villages nearby.\nFaradje, a town with an ends-of-the-earth feel and about 25,000 people, seems to be sleep-walking through a new, violent reality. The mud streets where people used to sell cassava and cigarettes are, one by one, becoming deserted. The few children around stick to their huts. The rebels bludgeoned to death Faradje\u2019s one doctor. They ransacked the police station and the market. They slaughtered around 150 people and kidnapped more than 200, mostly the young.\nSo far, Mary Yebiye Siro has been one of the only ones to escape. She said she was 22 but she looked more like 16, with a smooth face and trembling lips.\nShe shared her story on the porch of an old red-roofed school with faint hints of Faradje\u2019s better days. This area used to be an agricultural hub, where Belgians, Greeks and Lebanese traded in coffee and cotton hauled across this mammoth country through a network of rivers and barges. In some towns, you can still see the names of the old Greek merchants chiseled into abandoned buildings beginning their slow, inexorable slide toward the jungle floor.\n\u201cThey took me on Christmas,\u201d Mrs. Yebiye said. Several dozen villagers squeezed around. Her story was one of the first inside accounts of the rebel army Faradje had ever heard.\nShe said the rebels had dreadlocks and wild eyes. They believed in witchcraft and dabbed themselves with palm oil. They marched in seemingly endless circles, often through elephant grass as high as their heads, but never seemed to get lost. Sometimes, they liked to dance.\n\u201cThe rebels would eat their marijuana and turn up their radios in the middle of the jungle,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t dance with them, you got killed.\u201d\nIt is stories like these that have sent the farmers and the other civilians out on loosely organized search-and-destroy missions. But in mid-January, in a village not far from here, it did not work out so well. Some farmers crossed paths with a band of rebel fighters, Mr. Dalafada said. The rebels killed four farmers and fled.\nHuman rights groups have said the Ugandan-led offensive against the rebels was poorly planned because villages should have been protected by proper soldiers, not boys armed with farm implements. Military officials have acknowledged that the offensive did not go as intended. But several said the attack had weakened the rebels, destroyed their support base and put them on the run in unforgiving terrain.\n\u201cNature will eat them,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jean-Paul Dietrich, a spokesman for the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo.\nPerhaps. But Mrs. Yebiye described the rebel fighters as very adept in the bush, surviving off little food and filthy water. They had many phones and radios, she said. There have even been recent reports of rebels captured with night-vision goggles.\nOne night toward the end of January, the men who kidnapped her stopped near a village. The fighters, who spoke a different language than she did, gestured to Mrs. Yebiye to wait. They were apparently hunting for more children. Throughout their 20 years of brutalizing, the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army has become notorious for many things. But kidnapping children and turning them into porters, sex slaves and killing machines seems to be their special form of cruelty \u2014 though children now seem to be getting involved on all sides of this conflict.\nMrs. Yebiye said she heard voices speaking Lingala, the local tongue. She looked around, saw no rebels and dashed toward a cluster of huts. She does not remember who took her in. Eventually, she was brought to a Congolese army camp and put on a truck back to Faradje.\nAs she finished her tale, one woman rushed in from the fields, sobbing. She hugged Mrs. Yebiye tight and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think she would ever come back.\u201d\nFrom the thick silence that enveloped the crowd, it seemed that nobody else did either.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/world/africa/19congo.html", "title": "Armed With Little but Resolve, and Defending a Hollowed Village", "author": "JEFFREY GETTLEMAN"}
{"date": "Wed, 08 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "GHAZNI, Afghanistan \u2014 As part of his new strategy for Afghanistan, President Obama has announced plans to send 4,000 more American troops this spring to train the Afghan National Police and Army.\nBut a shortage of American trainers is only one factor hampering the Afghan police. If the experience of the American troops already training police officers in Ghazni Province is any indication, better policing may be impossible for Afghanistan unless government officials at all levels stop cannibalizing their civil administration and police force for a quick profit.\nIn two weeks of interviews in this mountainous region of poor farmers and shepherds, exasperated American soldiers said it was hard to determine which was their more daunting opponent \u2014 the few thousand Taliban who ruled villages through a shadow government of mullahs, or corruption so rife that it had deeply undercut efforts to improve the police and had destroyed many Afghans\u2019 faith in government.\nThat lack of trust, coupled with the absence of security forces in almost all villages, further strengthens the hand of the Taliban as the only real power here. Ghazni\u2019s experience shows the challenge that corruption presents to efforts to establish better policing throughout the country.\nThe list of schemes that undermine law enforcement is long and bewildering, according to American and Afghan officers who cite some examples: police officials who steal truckloads of gasoline; judges and prosecutors who make decisions based on bribes; high-ranking government officials who reap payoffs from hashish and chromite smuggling; and midlevel security and political jobs that are sold, sometimes for more than $50,000, money the buyers then recoup through still more bribes and theft.\nIn some cases the American officers requested that their names not be used when discussing specific allegations or that the titles of certain Afghan government and police leaders be withheld, since it would otherwise make it impossible to work with these officials, an important part of their mission.\nBut the frustration was palpable as they described the enormous corruption running the length of the civilian administration in this province of 1.3 million people, whose capital, Ghazni, lies 80 miles southwest of Kabul.\nReferring to one corrupt and high-ranking government official he sees routinely, Maj. Randy Schmeling, a 43-year-old Army National Guardsman who commands the American police mentoring teams in Ghazni, said, \u201cI\u2019d like to break down his door, stomp on his chest, point my 9-millimeter at his head and say, \u2018Stop what you are doing!\u2019 \u201d\nSome of the troops\u2019 Afghan colleagues recognize the problem, too. \u201cIn every office there is corruption,\u201d said Col. Mohammed Zaman, the departing provincial police chief. \u201cIt\u2019s not only prosecutors and judges.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the reason no one accepts the rule of law,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the government is not going by the rule of law.\u201d\nThe result is an ineffective and woefully undersupplied Afghan police force and a frustrating lack of justice for Afghans. Worse still, by comparison with the government\u2019s exercise of authority, the law imposed by the Taliban is far more certain \u2014 quick and clear, if ruthless.\n\u201cThe appointed officials and elected officials, the people don\u2019t trust them, and they don\u2019t trust them with good reason,\u201d Major Schmeling said. \u201cThey take from them and they give nothing back.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cRight now, there is no meritocracy here. It\u2019s, \u2018Hey, your sister has a pretty mouth \u2014 do you want to be a general?\u2019 \u201d\nThat culture of corruption affects everything: promotions, assignments, the resolution of cases. As one example, Major Schmeling pointed to a police officer who a year ago was a lowly patrolman and gate guard. Then, he said, the policeman scraped together the money for a new job: a top noncommissioned officer on the provincial police force.\n\u201cAs long as people are buying themselves into positions like that, the people will never trust the system,\u201d the major said.\nTo those buying jobs, the payments are an investment they intend to recover, along with a profit. Jobs that bring more money, like posts near the Kabul-Kandahar highway that allow opportunities for extorting truckers and smugglers, sell for a premium, soldiers here say.\nBut in the process, honest officials are passed over or punished. \u201cYou could say that the corruption you are involved in is an investment in your future, and your family\u2019s future,\u201d said First Lt. Craig Porte, a military intelligence officer in Ghazni, who said it was \u201cfairly common to buy your position\u201d in government. \u201cIf you are not involved in corruption, you are seen as an enemy of those who are, which has a tendency to get you fired.\u201d\nMany soldiers question whether anything will ever change. \u201cThe corruption here is a bigger threat to a stable government than the Taliban,\u201d said First Sgt. John Strain, the senior noncommissioned officer on the American unit training the Ghazni police.\n\u201cIf we stay here another year, or another 50 years, I think it\u2019ll probably only take two to three years after we are gone until it reverts to the way it was right before we got here,\u201d he added. \u201cTo have to admit that when you look at these kids,\u201d he said, referring to Afghanistan\u2019s children, \u201cit really breaks your heart, to think that what you are doing is probably not going to turn out to be a hill of beans.\u201d\nExtortion by police officers is common. But there is fraud and swindling up the chain of command, too. Several police officials are part of a group that has been stealing thousands of gallons of gasoline a month, a major reason some districts receive less than half their allotments, said American officers, who are mostly powerless to do anything but report corruption to their superiors.\nAs a measure of the corruption, the American officers said, one senior provincial official recently paid $50,000 to free a kidnapped relative \u2014 about five times his annual salary.\nAmerican officers described another Ghazni provincial police official who had a lucrative side business: coercing police officers to sign requisitions for far more weapons than they actually needed. Then the official would keep the extra weapons and sell them, sometimes to the Taliban. The official was killed recently, officers said.\nIn some places, government officials are believed to have paid off Taliban fighters to limit attacks, allowing smuggling that benefits provincial officials to continue without interference, several American and Afghan officials from Ghazni said.\nIn this swindle, provincial \u201cbodyguards\u201d demand protection money from smugglers, anywhere from $400 to $2,000 per truck, for safe passage through Ghazni, said a Ghazni police official recently forced out of his job.\n\u201cHigh-ranking officials in Ghazni have immunity from the law,\u201d said the official, who feared retribution and agreed to speak only if he was not identified. Likening many provincial officials to a criminal mafia, he added, \u201cPeople have no choice but to go to the Taliban to solve their problems.\u201d\nIndeed, in Ghazni\u2019s impoverished villages, where the light brown of clay walls and mud homes is broken only by green plots of winter wheat, the Taliban exploit the widespread sense that the government does not serve people. When the Taliban were in power in the 1990s, corruption and official bribery were more limited.\nThe lack of competent civilian authority aids the insurgents. Afghan Army officers trained by Maj. Daren Runion \u201cdon\u2019t like the Taliban,\u201d he said. But some believe \u201cthat in some ways parts of their rule were better.\u201d\nPolice officers from a handful of Ghazni districts have gone through an intensive eight-week training course and returned to their districts to be overseen by American mentors. Nationwide, more than 3,000 police officers have gone through the course, a linchpin of the American effort to expand the police.\nThe new training has helped the police on the ground. Patrolmen are more alert, with better weapons discipline and less absenteeism, American officers here say.\nBut with little support from the government, most police forces remain a trivial presence in villages, marshaling their meager resources just to protect district centers and their small outposts.\nEven if the corruption were not so debilitating, American and Afghan forces would still face a sizable enemy. Major Schmeling estimates that there are 2,000 Taliban fighters in the province. \u201cThey still exercise the exact same control over these villages that they had up until 2001,\u201d he said.\nIn Qarabagh, one of the largest districts, the Taliban use 40 villages as bases to dominate hundreds of other villages, said Qarabagh\u2019s deputy police chief, Capt. Mohammed Younus.\nPolice recruits are easy prey. Twenty-four policemen have been killed in Taliban ambushes and roadside bombings in Qarabagh over the past year, Captain Younus said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any presence with the civilians,\u201d he said. \u201cTaliban live with them 24 hours a day.\u201d Residents take complaints to local Taliban leaders, not the police, he said. \u201cThey have a judge and prosecutor. The Taliban is active at the bazaar in each village.\u201d\nIn Waghaz District, near Qarabagh, there are just 50 permanent Taliban members, among a population of up to 60,000 ethnic Pashtuns and 33,000 Hazara, said Abdul Azim, the subgovernor of Waghaz. Yet the Taliban do not need a large presence to dominate, he explained. Last year, he said, the Taliban took three men from their homes whom they suspected of helping the government.\n\u201cThey burned the three men and chopped their limbs off with axes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the 60,000 cannot beat the 50.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/world/asia/09ghazni.html", "title": "Corruption Undercuts Hopes for Afghan Police", "author": "RICHARD A.

{"date": "Thu, 24 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIJING \u2014 In an unequivocal rebuke to those pursuing political reforms, a Chinese court on Friday sentenced one of the country\u2019s best-known dissidents to 11 years in prison for subversion.\nLiu Xiaobo, 53, a former literature professor and a dogged critic of China\u2019s single-party political system, was detained in December 2008 after he helped draft a petition known as Charter 08 that demanded the right to free speech, open elections and the rule of law.\nThe 11-page verdict, largely a restatement of his indictment, was read out Friday morning at the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People\u2019s Court, said Mr. Liu\u2019s lawyer, Shang Baojun. In addition to his prison term, Mr. Liu will be deprived of his political rights for an additional two years, a penalty that will prevent him from writing or speaking out on a wide range of issues.\n\u201cWe are just extremely disappointed,\u201d said Mr. Shang, who added that Mr. Liu intended to appeal the verdict.\nGregory May, first secretary with the U.S. Embassy who stood outside the courthouse Friday morning, called on the authorities to immediately release Mr. Liu.\n\u201cPersecution of individuals for the peaceful expression of political views is inconsistent with internationally recognized norms of human rights,\u201d he said.\nAlthough Mr. Liu had faced a 15-year sentence, legal experts and human rights advocates said the punishment was very harsh and was meant to send a message to others who might agitate for political reform in one of the world\u2019s longest-running authoritarian governments.\nNicholas Bequelin, a senior Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, described Mr. Liu as \u201ca sacrificial lamb\u201d and said that the Communist Party leadership was trying to intimidate its critics. The rights group called the trial \u201ca travesty of justice.\u201d\nMr. Bequelin and others said Mr. Liu\u2019s prosecution for violating rights enshrined in China\u2019s Constitution suggested a political hardening, a trend that began before the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\u201cIt shows that the leadership is increasingly conservative and restrictive of basic freedoms,\u201d Mr. Bequelin said, \u201cand it also sends a strong message to the rest of the world that China is not really serious when it talks about human rights.\u201d\nJoshua Rosenzweig, a senior researcher at the Dui Hua Foundation, which advocates on behalf of Chinese political prisoners, said Mr. Liu\u2019s sentence was the longest for subversion charges in more than a decade.\nIn 2005, Shi Tao, a journalist and poet, was convicted of leaking state secrets and given a 10-year term after he sent an internal party memo to an overseas Web site. Last year, Hu Jia, an AIDS activist and environmentalist, was imprisoned for three and a half years on charges that his Internet writings incited subversion.\nMr. Liu has been held in secret for more than a year and his lawyers were given less than two weeks to prepare their defense. The trial on Wednesday lasted two hours and was closed; his wife, Liu Xia, and more than two dozen diplomats from the United States, Canada and the European Union were barred from the courtroom.\nOn Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman angrily dismissed foreign criticisms of Mr. Liu\u2019s prosecution, calling them a \u201cgross interference of China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\nThis is not Mr. Liu\u2019s first brush with China\u2019s harsh judicial system. He spent 21 months in detention for taking part in the 1989 pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square. And in 1996, after demanding clemency for those still imprisoned for their roles in the demonstrations, he was sent to a labor camp for three years.\nIn addition to helping create Charter 08, Mr. Liu\u2019s charge for \u201cinciting subversion of state power\u201d was based on six articles he wrote that were published on the Internet outside of China.\nReleased on Dec. 10, 2008, International Human Rights Day, Charter 08 garnered some 10,000 signatures before it was removed from the Web by government censors. To this day, it is virtually unknown in China.\nDuring the brief trial on Wednesday, Mr. Liu\u2019s lawyers rejected the prosecution\u2019s contention that the document sought to overthrow the Communist Party. Zhang Zuhua, a former party official and political scholar who co-authored the manifesto with Mr. Liu, described the subversion charge as \u201cabsurd,\u201d calling it \u201ca violation of the Chinese Constitution\u2019s guarantee of free speech.\u201d Mr. Zhang was briefly detained last year and has since been under 24-hour surveillance by security personnel.\nThe state-controlled media has not covered Mr. Liu\u2019s trial \u2014 nor has it allowed any mention of Charter 08 \u2014 but Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, published a brief item Friday that described the sentence and said the court \u201chad strictly followed the legal procedures in this case and fully protected Liu\u2019s litigation rights.\u201d\nNews of his sentencing quickly spread via Twitter, which is blocked in China but can be accessed by those able to circumvent the so-called Great Firewall. Many of those who sent messages displayed the image of a yellow ribbon as a declaration of their sympathies. Others defiantly listed personal details about the presiding judge in the case.\nAt least two dozen supporters who stood outside the courthouse during Mr. Liu\u2019s trial on Wednesday were later questioned and released.\nLiu Di, a signer of Charter 08, was among a handful of people who publicly declared their desire to stand trial with Liu Xiaobo.\n\u201cFor the dignity of the Constitution and the law, and for no more imprisonment of people for their independent opinions, I would prefer to share with Mr. Liu Xiaobo the same case with the same penalty,\u201d wrote Ms. Liu, a blogger better known by her online identity, the Stainless Steel Mouse.\nOn Friday, officials allowed the defendant and his wife to meet for 10 minutes in a small room, although they were divided by a glass barrier. It was the third time they had seen each other since his detention last year.\n\u201cPeople always say they\u2019re so inhumane,\u201d she said of the government afterward, \u201cso I think they just wanted to show a little humanity.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/world/asia/25china.html", "title": "Leading China Dissident Gets 11-Year Term for Subversion", "author": "ANDREW JACOBS"}
{"date": "Mon, 20 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned political leaders on Monday to be cautious in addressing the country\u2019s recent unrest, in an apparent rebuke to two former presidents who have openly criticized the government\u2019s handling of the disputed June 12 presidential election.\nAyatollah Khamenei, in a meeting with government officials that was broadcast by state television, kept his remarks vague, warning darkly against \u201ca hand that wishes to strike at the system,\u201d and saying the political elite could \u201ccollapse\u201d if it does not adequately meet the challenge it faces.\nBut his comments made clear that the governing elite was not backing down in the face of an emboldened opposition that rejected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s re-election as fraudulent and mounted renewed street protests in recent days.\nAyatollah Khamenei\u2019s remarks appeared to be aimed at two former presidents who had taken up the mantle of Iran\u2019s opposition in recent days: Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami. Mr. Rafsanjani, the cleric who leads two important state institutions, said Friday that the government had lost the trust of many Iranians, and he urged the release of the protesters arrested in the recent street protests. Mr. Khatami expanded on those comments on Sunday, calling for a referendum on the government\u2019s legitimacy.\nThose remarks posed a clear challenge to Ayatollah Khamenei, who hailed Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s victory as fair last month and blamed foreign agitators and journalists for the unrest \u2014 Iran\u2019s worst in decades.\nAyatollah Khamenei spoke contemptuously of the protesters on Monday, saying: \u201cIt is a mistake to believe that a limited group of people, in Tehran only \u2014 setting fire to rubbish bins, to public property, to motorbikes, to their cars, to their banks \u2014 are people. These are not people.\u201d\nAnother comment seemed aimed at Mr. Rafsanjani, who declined to say in his speech on Friday that the coming government would be legitimate, as hard-liners had urged him to do.\n\u201cEveryone should proceed with extreme vigilance with respect to their stance, both in what they say and in what they do not say,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said. \u201cNot speaking is the same as not fulfilling our responsibilities.\u201d\nThe Guardian Council issued its own response on Monday to Mr. Rafsanjani, who had accused it of not properly reviewing concerns about election irregularities. Abbas-Ali Kadkhodaei, the council\u2019s spokesman, said it had done everything possible to investigate the election results and dispel any public distrust, Iran\u2019s Press TV reported. He said Mr. Rafsanjani had done nothing to ease the situation, despite efforts to seek his advice.\nAlso on Monday, Mir Hussein Moussavi, the leading challenger to Mr. Ahmadinejad, visited the families of people arrested in the recent crackdown, telling them they were \u201cnot alone\u201d and lashing out at the state news media for maligning them, reformist Web sites reported.\n\u201cA government that comes into power in an environment of mistrust and tricks will be a weak one,\u201d Mr. Moussavi said, according to the Web sites. \u201cThis is the kind of government that gives concessions to foreigners because it doesn\u2019t have popular support.\u201d\nHe spoke a day after several hundred antigovernment protesters took to the streets in the southern city of Shiraz, reformist Web sites reported. More opposition protests are expected across Iran on Tuesday, the anniversary of demonstrations in 1952 in support of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, widely viewed as a national hero. Mr. Mossadegh was removed the following year in a coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency.\nIn a break from the past, opposition Web sites were calling Monday for the protests on Tuesday to take place in southern Tehran, which is mostly working class. The opposition has often been caricatured as elitist, with support only in the more affluent northern part of the capital.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/world/middleeast/21iran.html", "title": "Iran\u2019s Chief Cleric Warns Political Leaders Over Election Criticism", "author": "ROBERT F.

{"date": "Fri, 20 Mar 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JERUSALEM \u2014 An Israeli newspaper gave a fuller account on Friday of testimonies by soldiers alleging loose rules of engagement in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which they said led to civilian deaths and wanton property destruction. One soldier asserted that extremist rabbis had told troops they were fighting a holy war.\nThe soldier was quoted as saying that the rabbis had \u201cbrought in a lot of booklets and articles,\u201d adding, \u201ctheir message was very clear: We are the Jewish people, we came to this land by a miracle. God brought us back to this land, and now we need to fight to expel the non-Jews who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land.\u201d\nHe said that as a commander, he had tried to explain to his men that \u201cnot everyone who is in Gaza is Hamas,\u201d and that \u201cthis war was not a war for the sanctification of the holy name, but rather one to stop the Qassam rockets.\u201d\nThe account, in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, expanded on shorter excerpts printed Thursday in Haaretz and Maariv, a center-right newspaper, and came from a taped conversation among Gaza war veterans at an institute that prepares soldiers before their service. After the materials were published, the military advocate general began an investigation into the allegations.\nThe director of the institute where the discussion occurred, Dany Zamir, published the accounts in his newsletter and leaked them to the newspapers to draw attention to what he considered to be troubling revelations. Mr. Zamir is known to be on the left of Israel\u2019s political spectrum.\nHe is quoted in the excerpts as saying to the soldiers who spoke: \u201cI think it would be important for parents to sit here and hear this discussion. I think it would be an instructive discussion, and also very dismaying and depressing. You are describing an army with very low norms of value, that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\nEarlier excerpts included an account of the killing of an elderly woman by a sharpshooter and the killing of a woman and two children by another sniper.\nThe testimonies published Friday also spoke of the ease with which some houses were damaged.\nAnother soldier said: \u201cWe got an order one day \u2014 all of the equipment, all of the furniture, just clean out the whole house. We threw everything, everything out of the windows to make room. The entire contents of the house went flying out the windows.\u201d\nThe soldier also alleged that when entering buildings, \u201cwe were supposed to go up floor by floor, and any person we identified, we were supposed to shoot. I initially asked myself, where is the logic in this?\u201d\n\u201cFrom above they said it was permissible, because anyone who remained in the sector and inside Gaza City was in effect condemned, a terrorist, because they hadn\u2019t fled. I didn\u2019t really understand. On one hand they don\u2019t really have anywhere to flee to, but on the other hand they\u2019re telling us they hadn\u2019t fled so it\u2019s their fault.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/21/world/middleeast/21gaza.html", "title": "More Allegations Surface in Israeli Accounts of Gaza War", "author": "ETHAN BRONNER"}

Three had their sentences suspended for two years.\nThree other convicts were given life terms in prison, and five received lighter sentences, the news agency, Xinhua, reported.\nThe defendants were tried in three separate cases.\nIn the first two, the defendants had ethnic Uighur names, while in the third case they had ethnic Han names. In that case, a man named Han Junbo was sentenced to death while another, Liu Bo, was given a prison term of 10 years, both for attacking two Uighur men \u201con rumors,\u201d the report said. One of the victims was killed.\nIt was the first time that defendants who were apparently ethnic Han had been sentenced in connection with the rioting that began on July 5.\nOn Monday, the same court, based in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region, condemned to death six men with Uighur names in connection with the riots. The unrest in July left 197 people dead and more than 1,600 injured, most of them Han, according to the government\u2019s reports. A seventh man was given a life sentence. Those were the first sentences handed down in the aftermath of the riots, and they have been widely criticized by Uighur groups in exile.\nThe Xinjiang region, in far western China, has been stirred in recent months by tensions and clashes between Uighurs and Han, the dominant ethnic group in China. Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Sunni Muslim people, have complained about the dilution of their cultural and religious traditions, as well as the movement of large numbers of Han Chinese into Xinjiang in recent years.\nIn the July riots, at least 130 of those killed were Han, according to the government. The initial rioting on July 5 was the deadliest ethnic conflict in China in decades, and Han reprisals soon followed.\nTensions heightened further in September when rumors began to race through Urumqi that Uighurs were stabbing Han residents with infected syringes. The panic led thousands of Han Chinese to gather to protest the government\u2019s failure to protect them from such attacks.\nThe government responded by removing the police chief of Xinjiang and the Communist Party official in charge of Urumqi. The police also arrested 75 people in connection with the syringe attacks, according to Xinhua, and last month the Urumqi court sentenced three of the suspects \u2014 two Uighur men and a Uighur woman \u2014 to prison terms of from 7 to 15 years.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/16/world/asia/16china.html", "title": "Six More Sentenced to Death Over Riots in China", "author": "EDWARD WONG and MARK McDONALD"}
{"date": "Tue, 25 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The preliminary results from Afghanistan\u2019s election gave both President Hamid Karzai and his chief rival, Abdullah Abdullah, nearly 40 percent of the vote on Tuesday as accumulating charges of widespread fraud cast new doubts on the credibility of the election.\nThe returns announced were based on just 10 percent of ballots from a variety of provinces and seemed carefully balanced to keep emotions calm as election officials came under increasing pressure from all sides to demonstrate that the presidential election was fair.\nBut even as election officials announced the first glimpse of returns, presidential candidates presented a growing bank of evidence of vote rigging. Most of it appeared to favor President Karzai, and in some cases, to have taken place with the complicity of election or security officials.\nWhat was presented included sheaves of ballots stamped and marked for one candidate, cell-phone video of poll workers and others marking off ballots and stuffing boxes in front of local police officers and security personnel, and votes said to have been thrown out of ballot boxes and discarded.\nAt a news briefing in his home in Kabul, Mr. Abdullah, the president\u2019s main challenger, held a whole book of ballots and flicked through the pages to show that every one of them had been marked and stamped, apparently in advance of election day, for Mr. Karzai. Supporters had seized the ballots and brought them to him, he said.\nHe also displayed a series of photos showing a man whom he said he knew voting several times, and video of the local election chief stuffing ballot boxes himself.\n\u201cSo which part of this process do we trust?\u201d he said to the massed ranks of journalists and photographers. \u201cThese were a few pieces of evidence out of thousands.\u201d\nHe called on the international monitors, election officials and diplomats watching the process not to let the fraud pass.\nA group of six other presidential candidates gave news organizations an open letter denouncing widespread fraud and intimidation in the election.\n\u201cFraud in the election could result in increased tension and violence, and millions of Afghans across the nation are concerned,\u201d the six candidates, including the former finance minister Ashraf Ghani and one of two female candidates, Frozan Fana, said in their joint statement.\nAs the disputes mounted, a powerful truck bomb rocked Mr. Karzai\u2019s hometown of Kandahar as townspeople broke their Ramadan fast, a further reminder of the insurgent threat that kept many Afghans from the polls last Thursday. Hospital officials said at least 30 people were killed, and 56 injured, most of them civilians.\nThe violence and political sparring left Western and Afghan officials calling for calm and patience as election officials tabulated the ballots and investigated the irregularities, a process that could delay an official announcement of a winner for weeks, even if a runoff is not needed.\nThe irregularities and insecurity, and the remoteness of some polling stations in a poor nation with rugged terrain and bad roads and communications were all contributing to the slowness of tallying the vote.\nThe American special envoy to the region, Richard C. Holbrooke, said it was premature to interpret the results.\n\u201cTen percent of the vote is in,\u201d he told reporters traveling with him during a visit to Turkey. \u201cImagine an American election with 10 percent in. You don\u2019t call it with 10 percent.\u201d\nElection officials and monitors also emphasized that the results announced Tuesday were not enough to project an outcome. They showed Mr. Karzai leading with 38 percent of the vote and Mr. Abdullah second with 36.5 percent. Just over half a million votes have been tallied from 10 percent of the polling stations around the country, said Daoud Ali Najafi, deputy director of the election commission.\nMore than 50 percent of the vote is needed to avoid a runoff, and Mr. Karzai\u2019s supporters have claimed that the president has 68 percent. Mr. Abdullah, a former foreign minister, has also claimed that he is ahead.\nThe election \u2014 only Afghanistan\u2019s second for president \u2014 is being run by Afghan officials, but United Nations election experts are closely involved and remain a robust presence, an international observer said.\nSome of these observers, who did not want to be identified while the votes were still being counted, said that while there were indications that fraud had occurred on a large scale, the procedures around the vote count should catch much of the most blatant vote-rigging.\nBallots were counted Thursday night at most polling stations, but not at some, usually because of insecurity in Taliban areas. Election officials, as well as candidates\u2019 agents and monitors, were able to collect those results and call them into their respective headquarters. Yet the candidates may not have a full picture of the returns since they did not have agents in every location.\nElection officials have declined to release the early telephone reports from their officials. They have insisted instead on waiting until the sealed documents from each polling station are brought to Kabul, verified and entered into computers in a double entry system to prevent fraud.\nMost of the documents have arrived in Kabul except for those from two of the more remote provinces, Helmand and Badakhshan, said Mr. Najafi, of the election commission. Results will be announced on a daily basis as they are tabulated, he said.\nBoth the election commission and a separate body, the Election Complaints Commission, are also conducting audits and investigating irregularities. The commission\u2019s software is designed to detect unusual voting patterns that could indicate fraud, officials said. Suspect numbers or polling stations will be set aside and if proved fraudulent will be excluded from the count.\nBut the evidence of fraud presented by Mr. Abdullah\u2019s campaign also raised suspicion of some election officials themselves. In one video clip, which appeared to be recorded with a cellphone, local police and election officials were stuffing ballot boxes as someone could be heard joking, \u201cat least put two for Bashardost,\u201d a reference to the presidential candidate Ramazan Bashardost, who is now in third place with about 10 percent.\nHundreds of witnesses were coming forward with their own accounts of fraud, Mr. Abdullah said, adding, \u201cThat shows the tragedy which the incumbent has taken this country to, and unfortunately our people are suffering from it.\u201d\nHe asked the international community \u201cnot to turn a blind eye toward the big state mockery which is under way.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/26/world/asia/26afghan.html", "title": "Wide Fraud Is Charged as Afghans Tally Votes", "author": "CARLOTTA GALL"}

Disregarding Mr. Ebsary as a suspect, the police decided that Mr. Marshall, known to them from previous run-ins, had killed his friend in an unexplained fit of rage. A jury agreed, and Mr. Marshall began serving a life sentence.\nHe was released from prison in 1982 after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reviewed his case, and a year later the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal declared him not guilty of the murder. In its ruling, however, the court stated that Mr. Marshall was \u201cthe author of his own misfortune\u201d and that there had been no miscarriage of justice.\nA royal commission of inquiry later criticized that finding as \u201ca serious and fundamental error.\u201d In a seven-volume report delivered in 1990, it said police incompetence and \u201csystemic racism\u201d infecting the police department, the court system, the government bureaucracy and even Mr. Marshall\u2019s own lawyers were to blame for the conviction.\n\u201cThe criminal justice system failed Donald Marshall Jr. at virtually every turn, from his arrest and wrongful conviction for murder in 1971 up to and even beyond his acquittal by the Court of Appeal in 1983,\u201d the report stated.\nA subsequent Supreme Court case, citing Mr. Marshall\u2019s ordeal several times, led to changes in evidence disclosure rules. Prosecutors had withheld information from the defense in the Marshall case, judging it irrelevant. The prosecution must now fully disclose to the defense any evidence it has; the defense must ensure that full disclosure from the prosecution takes place, and must fully disclose its own evidence only in establishing alibis, regardless of their opinions on its relevance to a case.\nThe Marshall case became the subject of a book, \u201cJustice Denied\u201d (1986), by Michael Harris, and a 1989 film of the same name.\n\u201cIt was the first commission of inquiry into a wrongful conviction in Canada,\u201d said Anne Derrick, a provincial judge who, as a lawyer, represented Mr. Marshall during the Royal Commission\u2019s work. \u201cIt stripped away a lot of the assumptions that people had about the criminal justice system.\u201d\nIn 1993 Mr. Marshall was arrested and charged with fishing for eels out of season and without a license. In 1999, ruling on a case in which Mr. Marshall was the primary petitioner, the Supreme Court affirmed the centuries-old treaty rights of the Mi\u2019kmaq and Maliseet in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to earn a living from hunting, fishing and gathering.\nMr. Marshall, known as Junior, was one of 13 children of Donald Marshall Sr., who later became the grand chief of the Mi\u2019kmaq nation.\nMr. Marshall continued to face legal troubles after his famous court cases. In 2006 he was charged with attempted murder for driving over a man after a New Year\u2019s Eve party. Charges were dropped after Mr. Marshall and the other man agreed to take part in a ritual known as a healing circle. At the time of his death, he faced charges that he had assaulted and threatened his wife, Colleen D\u2019Orsay.\nFor most Canadians, however, he remained the living symbol of a terrible miscarriage of justice.\n\u201cI can remember the day the commission\u2019s report came out, and I told Junior Marshall he was exonerated,\u201d Ms. Derrick said Thursday in a telephone interview. \u201cIt was as though a huge boulder had been lifted from his shoulders. He waited a long time for that.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/world/americas/07marshall.html", "title": "Donald Marshall Jr., Symbol of Bias, Dies at 55", "author": "WILLIAM GRIMES"}
{"date": "Sun, 08 Feb 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 In the final days before a referendum that will determine whether President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez can run for re-election indefinitely, campaigning has taken on a noticeable, and sometimes ugly, edge.\nAntigovernment protests have intensified in some cities, despite government pressure, and pro-Ch\u00e1vez vigilantes have attacked institutions like the Caracas mayor\u2019s office and the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic mission.\nThis is Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s second try in less than two years at extending his stay in office, which he says is necessary to continue the socialist-inspired revolution that he began here a decade ago. The narrow rejection of his attempt in late 2007 \u2014 part of a broader constitutional overhaul \u2014 was an embarrassing blow for a leader used to adulation.\nThe referendum next Sunday also offers an opening for Venezuela\u2019s fractious opposition to look beyond 2013, when Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s current six-year term expires. The president\u2019s followers control every political institution of importance at the federal level, including the Supreme Court and National Assembly.\n\u201cFor the opposition, the referendum is quite important because they continue to lack a leader capable of challenging Ch\u00e1vez for the presidency,\u201d said Gregory Wilpert, a Venezuela specialist who teaches political science at Brooklyn College. \u201cDefeating it is thus their best and perhaps only chance to beat Ch\u00e1vez in the foreseeable future.\u201d\nJust two months ago, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s allies lost ground in regional elections, with areas like Maracaibo, the second-largest city, and impoverished districts of Caracas going to the opposition. But the momentum from those victories has given way to a tight race over the 54-year-old president\u2019s bid to stay in office for years longer, or even decades, as he has hinted.\nAlthough many voters complain of problems like a surge in violent crime and rising inflation, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez has kept opponents on the defensive, displaying the political skills that have allowed him to consolidate power.\n\u201cCh\u00e1vez is surrounded by corrupt idiots, but he keeps his focus on helping the poor,\u201d said Omaira de Catacoli, 66, a cook who lives in Catia, a patchwork of slums in western Caracas. \u201cWithout Ch\u00e1vez, we would be left to the political thieves on every side. With Ch\u00e1vez, we have at least a little hope.\u201d\nVenezuela\u2019s economy is sharply slowing, injecting urgency into the campaigning on both sides. But in a move that seems to have mollified some opposition mayors and governors, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez altered the referendum to let voters also decide on lifting term limits for other elected officials.\nHere in the capital, a sense of low-intensity chaos has prevailed as the vote looms. Pro-Ch\u00e1vez partisans on motorcycles have carried out attacks with seeming impunity in recent days, lobbing tear gas canisters not only at the home of a television executive who has criticized the government, but at the papal diplomatic mission, which had granted asylum to a student leader who opposes Mr. Ch\u00e1vez. Other attacks have been aimed at municipal buildings controlled by the opposition and private media critical of the government.\nOver the weekend, the campaigning intensified. Thousands marched against Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s proposal to stay in power on Saturday through the main thoroughfares of Caracas, while Mr. Ch\u00e1vez led caravans in support of it in Caracas and Maracaibo.\nValent\u00edn Santana, the leader of a pro-Ch\u00e1vez group called La Piedrita, which has claimed responsibility for most of the tear gas attacks, promised \u201cwar,\u201d according to published remarks, if Mr. Ch\u00e1vez lost. On Saturday, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez ordered security forces to detain Mr. Santana.\nStudents have emerged again to fill the void of articulate leadership within the opposition.\nHowever, both the student movement and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s tactics for combating it have evolved since the president\u2019s last attempt to retain power in 2007. Once-embattled student leaders like Yon Goicoechea, who accepted a $500,000 prize in 2008 from the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, have lost support among some voters who rely on Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s social welfare programs even if they distrust his plan to stay in office.\n\u201cBetween Ch\u00e1vez and the students receiving the gringo dollars, I\u2019ll take Ch\u00e1vez,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Encarnaci\u00f3n Contreras, 58, a homemaker who lives in Catia.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s policies for dealing with the students are growing more repressive, with officials claiming some student protests turned violent or were about to do so. In recent days, the secret intelligence police have begun searching the homes of student leaders.\nState media are also exerting pressure on the students, in at least one case singling out leaders of Jewish origin for scrutiny.\n\u201cThere are two students, one is Diego Aaron Scharifker, and the other David Smolansky Urosa,\u201d Mario Silva, an ally of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, said last month in a broadcast of his show, \u201cLa Hojilla,\u201d or The Razorblade. \u201cScharifker and Smolansky are last names of Hebrew origin, Jewish last names; you see the problems right now.\u201d\nHe continued that there were sectors of power among Venezuelan Jews \u201cthat are very disgusted with the position of the president of the republic in his defense of the sovereignty of Palestine.\u201d\nThe verbal attack and other statements on state media have opened the government up to accusations of fostering a climate of intolerance marked by the desecration of a Sephardic synagogue here by gunmen last week. The attorney general\u2019s office said Sunday that 11 people had been detained in connection with the attack, including five members of the Metropolitan Police force and a detective with the secret intelligence police.\nBy focusing on the Gaza war and other international issues rather than domestic problems like violent crime, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s campaign is hoping to tilt to its advantage a race that revolves yet again around the personality of the president.\nOn billboards, he is seen celebrating the 10th year of his revolution. His voice bellows folk songs in subway stations. He surprises broadcasters on state television by phoning in to discuss campaign minutiae. He even inaugurated a newspaper column, called \u201cCh\u00e1vez\u2019s Lines.\u201d\n\u201cLike the horses that come from behind, Venezuela passed from being a dark and minimized country subordinated to the Yankee empire, to hold a lighting place of vanguard in the fights of the peoples of the world for its freedom,\u201d said a recent column, translated into English by the state news agency.\nIn the end, it is the voters in slums like those of Petare, another area of Caracas, who will decide. These areas, once pro-Ch\u00e1vez bastions, came into play for the opposition in the regional elections last November. But the opinion on Petare\u2019s streets on a recent afternoon suggested a race that was hard to predict.\n\u201cThe population is tired of so many elections,\u201d said Nicol\u00e1s Rudas, 42, who runs a gym in the Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ribas district of Petare. \u201cTwo terms and then you go, that\u2019s how it should be.\u201d\nBut nearby, Frank Tamayo, 33, a mechanic, said he was ready to give Mr. Ch\u00e1vez a chance to stay in power. \u201cThis is what democracy means,\u201d Mr. Tamayo said. \u201cThe power of the majority.\u201d", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/world/americas/09venez.html", "title": "Venezuelans Campaign on Term Limits Amid Rising Tension", "author": "SIMON ROMERO"}

{"date": "Sun, 19 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JERUSALEM \u2014 In the weeks since Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, finally accepted the principle of a Palestinian state, with qualifications, there has been deep skepticism about his sincerity.\nOn the Palestinian side, aides to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, have called Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s grudging endorsement of Palestinian statehood, under international pressure, a disingenuous public relations exercise.\nBut even senior officials and prominent figures of his conservative Likud Party have been busy explaining, privately and publicly, why they think there is not likely to be a Palestinian state any time soon, in ways that raise even more questions about the current government\u2019s commitment to reaching a final peace accord.\nAnd Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s diplomatic turnaround was greeted by a notable silence among the Likud firebrands and hawks, widely interpreted here as a sign that they feel they have nothing to fear.\nMarking his first 100 days in office earlier this month, Mr. Netanyahu credited his government with bringing about national consensus on \u201cthe idea of two states for two peoples,\u201d employing the language of the internationally accepted formula for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the first time. Last Sunday he called on the Palestinian leadership to meet for peace talks.\nMr. Netanyahu has been explicit, though, about his conditions for a deal. He says the Palestinians must recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people. Palestinian negotiators reject such recognition, contending it would preclude the demand of the Palestinian refugees of 1948 and their descendants for the right of return to their former homes, and be detrimental to the status of Israel\u2019s Arab minority.\nMr. Netanyahu adds that the problem of the refugees has to be resolved outside the borders of Israel and that Israel will only accept defensible borders, and he wants international guarantees that any Palestinian state will be fully demilitarized.\nTo that his aides have lately added that there is currently no Palestinian partner who can deliver the essential conditions for statehood as outlined by Mr. Netanyahu, or who is capable of making the historic compromise necessary for a final peace deal.\nIt is a familiar refrain: For years, leaders from the Likud Party refused to negotiate on grounds that Yasir Arafat, the strongman of Palestinian nationalism who many Israelis viewed as a dictatorial terrorist, was no partner for peace. Now his successor, Mahmoud Abbas, the Western-backed Palestinian president who has shunned violence against Israelis, is held in disregard for being domestically weak.\nThe Israeli leaders note that Mr. Abbas does not control Gaza, which was taken over by his Hamas rivals two years ago. They add that it is doubtful how much he controls what they call Judea and Samaria, the biblical name for the West Bank, and say that if the Israeli Army were to leave the area it could turn into another \u201cHamastan.\u201d\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s string of conditions for a Palestinian state do seem to have ameliorated opposition from the Israeli right.\nIn the past, \u201cIsraeli discourse on diplomacy has chiefly addressed the Palestinian need for a state but did not establish parallel Israeli rights,\u201d said Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a research institute, and a former ambassador who has long been close to Mr. Netanyahu.\nThe prime minister, he said, \u201ctried to correct that asymmetry\u201d by publicly defining fundamental Israeli interests for the first time.\nBut Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s father, Benzion Netanyahu, the 100-year-old historian and staunch right-wing ideologue, told Israel\u2019s Channel 2 News on July 8 that his son had set conditions he knew the Palestinians would never be able to accept.\nWhatever the prime minister\u2019s real intentions, those around him harbor low expectations of the chances for peace. Dan Meridor, deputy prime minister and minister of intelligence and atomic energy, and a leading pragmatist of Likud, recently told reporters that it was an \u201copen question\u201d whether the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank was ready to take the \u201cminimum steps needed\u201d to meet Israeli requirements for an end-of-conflict agreement.\n\u201cWe do not seem to have a partner now,\u201d Mr. Meridor said.\nSpeaking more bluntly, Uzi Arad, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s national security adviser and longtime confidant, in an interview with the newspaper Haaretz published on July 10, said, \u201cI have not yet encountered an Arab personage who is capable of saying quietly and clearly that he or she accepts Israel\u2019s right of existence in the deep historical and conscious sense,\u201d making it difficult to imagine a true agreement in the coming years.\nMr. Arad said there were \u201cno true peace leaders among the Palestinians,\u201d adding, \u201cat the moment, there is no one on the map.\u201d\nOther Netanyahu aides spoke privately in the same vein.\nThese conclusions, according to some of them, come from a policy review of past Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, which ended without results.\nIn particular, they noted, Ehud Olmert as prime minister went far in trying to reach an agreement with Mr. Abbas. Mr. Meridor said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that Mr. Netanyahu would offer the Palestinians better terms than Mr. Olmert did. Mr. Olmert has said that he never heard back.\nInstead, the Netanyahu government is proposing a bottom-up approach to peacemaking that might take some time, with an emphasis on development of the Palestinian economy in the West Bank. It has already removed several checkpoints and taken measures to ease the movement of people and goods.\nMr. Netanyahu has publicly called for talks on diplomatic and economic peace, but each side blames the other for the fact that negotiations remain stalled.\nThe Israelis say the Palestinians are being passive and have made a complete freeze in settlement building a condition for resuming talks.\nSaeb Erekat, a senior Abbas aide and veteran Palestinian negotiator, said stopping settlement construction, as the Americans have demanded, was \u201can Israeli obligation, not a Palestinian condition.\u201d There can be no compromise, he added. \u201cEither they stop or they do not,\u201d he said.\nThe Israelis say Mr. Erekat is just posturing. Mr. Erekat, meanwhile, said of the Israelis, \u201cThey are the ones refusing to meet with us.\u201d\nAdding to the circular feeling of the conflict, Mr. Erekat stated that if the Israelis were willing to resume negotiations like before on the core, final status issues of the conflict, including borders, refugees, Jerusalem and the settlements, \u201cthen Saeb Erekat will come.\u201d\nUnder the circumstances, experts say, the Obama administration\u2019s pursuit of a speedy two-state solution to the conflict can go only so far.\n\u201cThe key to making peace lies with the Israelis and the Palestinians,\u201d said Mr. Gold, the former ambassador. The United States cannot make peace, he said, or want it more than the two sides.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/world/middleeast/20israel.html", "title": "Netanyahu\u2019s Talk of Peace Finds Few True Believers", "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER"}

It is not uncommon for gay men and women to marry heterosexuals and have families, while carrying on secret relationships with members of the same sex.\nIn their decision, Chief Justice A. P. Shah and Justice S. Muralidhar declared Section 377, as it pertains to consensual sex among people above the age of 18, in violation of important parts of India\u2019s Constitution. \u201cConsensual sex amongst adults is legal, which includes even gay sex and sex among the same sexes,\u201d they said.\nThe old law violates Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees all people \u201cequality before the law;\u201d Article 15, which prohibits discrimination \u201con grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth;\u201d and Article 21, which guarantees \u201cprotection of life and personal liberty,\u201d the judges said.\nAcceptance of homosexuality has thawed somewhat in recent years in some urban areas. Gay pride parades in Indian cities last weekend attracted thousands of marchers, and several recent Bollywood movies, like \u201cDostana,\u201d have included gay themes and characters, often played by Bollywood\u2019s biggest heterosexual stars.\nStill, the decision was condemned from many corners in India. \u201cThis is wrong,\u201d said Maulana Abdul Khaliq Madrasi, a vice chancellor of Dar ul-Uloom, the main university for Islamic education in India. The decision to bring Western culture to India, he said, will \u201ccorrupt Indian boys and girls.\u201d\nThe High Court\u2019s decision should be overturned, said Murli Manohar Joshi, the leader of the main opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. \u201cThe High Court cannot decide all things,\u201d he said.\nThe ruling comes after a decade-long, broad-based campaign organized by gay rights advocates, authors, celebrities, lawyers and AIDS awareness groups from around the world. India has one of the world\u2019s largest populations of people with AIDS, and Section 377 was viewed by many advocates as a hurdle to education about safer sex.\nNow that the High Court has ruled against Section 377, some say the next step is a change in the way that society views gay people.\n\u201cThe real problem is still the stigma attached,\u201d especially outside big cities, said Ritu Dalmia, one of India\u2019s best-known chefs, who lives with her girlfriend in New Delhi.\nChange particularly needs to happen in rural India, she said in an e-mail message Thursday afternoon. \u201cI have met women who were forced to sleep with men so that they could be \u2018cured\u2019 of homosexuality,\u201d she said.\n\u201cToday is a historical moment where at least some tiny steps have been taken, but there is still a very, very long road ahead,\u201d she said.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/world/asia/03india.html", "title": "Indian Court Overturns Gay Sex Ban", "author": "HEATHER TIMMONS and HARI KUMAR"}
{"date": "Mon, 20 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran on Monday used the platform of a United Nations conference in Geneva on combating racism to disparage Israel as a \u201ccruel and repressive racist regime,\u201d prompting delegates from European nations to desert the hall and earning a rare harsh rebuke from Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.\nAs Mr. Ahmadinejad began to speak, two protesters wearing rainbow-hued clown wigs \u2014 their statement on the tenor of the proceedings \u2014 pelted him with red foam noses. Hustled out the door by security agents, they were soon followed by lines of stony-faced diplomats from the 23 European nations attending the conference. They walked out to the sound of some other delegates applauding Mr. Ahmadinejad.\nThe United States and more than a half-dozen other nations had already boycotted the gathering out of concern that it would focus on maligning Israel rather than on the global problems of discrimination, replaying the disputes that marked the first United Nations conference on combating racism in Durban, South Africa, in 2001.\nYears of negotiations intended to avoid just such a scenario failed, underscoring the uneasy gap that exists between the rest of the world and the West when it comes to certain issues, like whether Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians under occupation belongs at a forum on discrimination and xenophobia.\nThe speech and the reaction are also likely to complicate but not necessarily derail recent attempts between the West and Iran to forge new negotiations over the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear development program.\nMember states, who wrangled for months over the draft document for the Geneva conference, had ultimately removed controversial statements about Israel; about what constitutes defamation of religion, a position pushed by Muslim states; and about compensation for slavery.\nBut a reference in the draft document that endorsed the communiqu\u00e9 that emerged from the contentious Durban meeting \u2014 where the United States and Israel walked out \u2014 set off the boycott. Besides the United States, the countries staying away included Germany, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Australia. Canada and Israel announced months ago that they would not attend.\nMr. Ahmadinejad, who seems to take visible delight in his diatribes against Israel and denying events like the Holocaust because it so irks Iran\u2019s opponents, brought the contention roaring back to the fore. He was the only head of state to attend.\n\u201cFollowing World War II they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of Jewish suffering,\u201d Mr. Ahmadinejad said, grinning as he spoke, his remarks coincidentally falling on the day that Jewish communities mark the Holocaust. \u201cAnd they sent migrants from Europe, the United States and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in occupied Palestine.\u201d\nPortraying Israel as a regional boogeyman has been a cornerstone of Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution, although Mr. Ahmadinejad, facing a presidential election in June, is often criticized at home for spending too much time on Palestinian issues and not enough fixing the economic woes of Iranians.\nThe speech prompted the normally mild-mannered Mr. Ban and other top United Nations officials to voice uncommon criticism of the leader of a member state. \u201cI have not experienced this kind of destructive proceedings in an assembly, in a conference, by any one member state,\u201d Mr. Ban said.\n\u201cI deplore the use of this platform by the Iranian president to accuse, divide and even incite,\u201d he said, urging members to \u201cturn away from such a message in both form and substance.\u201d\nMr. Ban also criticized members of nongovernmental organizations for heckling Mr. Ahmadinejad.\nNavi Pillay, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, criticized Mr. Ahmadinejad for \u201cgrandstanding\u201d from a United Nations dais and said his performance should not be an excuse to derail the important topic of the conference.\nShe also made a not-so-subtle dig at Iran\u2019s treatment of its own minorities, after noting that the president\u2019s remarks were outside the scope of the conference. \u201cThis is what I would have expected the president of Iran to come and tell us: how he is addressing racial discrimination and intolerance in his country,\u201d Ms. Pillay said.\nMr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s speech prompted a chorus of condemnation. Israel recalled its ambassador to Switzerland to protest both the conference and meeting Sunday between the Swiss president, Hans-Rudolf Merz, and Mr. Ahmadinejad.\nAt the United Nations, Ambassador Alejandro D. Wolff, the deputy permanent representative for the United States, said the Iranians deserved better.\n\u201cIt shows disregard for the organization to which he is speaking \u2014 the United Nations \u2014 and does a grave injustice to the Iranian nation and the Iranian people,\u201d he said, suggesting that Iranian leaders show \u201cmuch more measured, moderate, honest and constructive rhetoric when dealing with issues in the region.\u201d\nNot everyone at the conference was critical of the speech, which also wandered through topics like the economic collapse and Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\u201cIf we actually believe in freedom of expression, then he has the right to say what he wants to say,\u201d the Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Zamir Akram, told The Associated Press. \u201cThere were things in there that a lot of people in the Muslim world would be in agreement with, for example the situation in Palestine, in Iraq and in Afghanistan, even if they don\u2019t agree with the way he said it.\u201d\nThose who supported the Obama administration\u2019s attending the conference said their attitude was not altered by Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s remarks. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the inappropriate and out-of-line remarks of Ahmadinejad would obscure the only international forum to address racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia,\u201d Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, said in a statement by the Congressional Black Caucus.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/world/21geneva.html", "title": "Iranian Calls Israel Racist at Meeting in Geneva", "author": "NEIL MacFARQUHAR"}
{"date": "Sun, 06 Dec 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration sent a forceful public message Sunday that American military forces could remain in Afghanistan for a long time, seeking to blunt criticism that President Obama had sent the wrong signal in his war-strategy speech last week by projecting July 2011 as the start of a withdrawal.\nIn a flurry of coordinated television interviews, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other top administration officials said that any troop pullout beginning in July 2011 would be slow and that the Americans would only then be starting to transfer security responsibilities to Afghan forces under Mr. Obama\u2019s new plan.\nThe television appearances by the senior members of Mr. Obama\u2019s war council seemed to be part of a focused and determined effort to ease concerns about the president\u2019s emphasis on setting a date for reducing America\u2019s presence in Afghanistan after more than eight years of war.\n\u201cWe have strategic interests in South Asia that should not be measured in terms of finite times,\u201d said Gen. James L. Jones, the president\u2019s national security adviser, speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in the region for a long time.\u201d\nEchoing General Jones, Mr. Gates played down the significance of the July 2011 target date.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a deadline,\u201d Mr. Gates said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWhat we have is a specific date on which we will begin transferring responsibility for security district by district, province by province in Afghanistan, to the Afghans.\u201d\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Mr. Gates said that under the plan, 100,000 American troops would be in Afghanistan in July 2011, and \u201csome handful, or some small number, or whatever the conditions permit, will begin to withdraw at that time.\u201d\nIn his prime-time address at West Point on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said that even as he planned to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, his administration would \u201cbegin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s speech set off alarms inside Afghanistan and Pakistan, as some officials worried about an American pullout before Afghan troops were ready to fight the Taliban on their own. It also set off a barrage of criticism from Republicans that the president was setting an arbitrary withdrawal date that would embolden Taliban insurgents to wait the Americans out.\nOn Sunday, the administration\u2019s top civilian and military officials marched in lockstep in insisting that July 2011 was just the beginning, not the end, of a lengthy process. That date, General Jones said, is a \u201cramp\u201d rather than a \u201ccliff.\u201d\nAs they seek to explain the new war strategy, administration officials face the task of calibrating the message about America\u2019s commitments in Afghanistan to different audiences, foreign and domestic, each of whom wants to hear different things.\nDuring weeks of wrenching internal debate, administration officials decided on the July 2011 benchmark in part to send a signal to Afghanistan\u2019s government that the clock was ticking for Afghan troops to take a greater role against the Taliban. The message was intended equally for domestic consumption: assuring skeptical Democratic lawmakers and many Americans that the United States military presence in Afghanistan was not open-ended.\nBut the White House has also faced sharp criticism from Republicans, who said it made little military sense to set a withdrawal date 18 months in the future because it handed the American strategy to the enemy.\nThe announcement of the July 2011 benchmark was also greeted with concern during private conversations among American officials and their counterparts in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and administration officials in recent days have acknowledged that they were surprised by the intensity of the anxiety among Afghan and Pakistani officials that the United States would beat a hasty retreat from the region.\nSince the White House strategy was announced, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan has publicly pledged to work with the United States to bolster Afghan forces. But he asked for patience and indicated that his country\u2019s military might not be ready in 18 months to take responsibility from American troops.\nDuring his recent inaugural address, Mr. Karzai said that Afghan forces would be able to take charge of securing Afghan cities within three years, and could take responsibility for the rest of the country within five years.\nSo officials try a balancing act as they sell the Afghan strategy. Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of United States Central Command, said Sunday that there was a natural \u201ctension\u201d between a message of resolve and the message of impatience after eight years of war. But he said the twin messages were not mutually exclusive.\nAppearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d General Petraeus said that the Obama administration was not planning a \u201crush to the exits\u201d in Afghanistan, and that depending on the security conditions there could be tens of thousands of American troops in Afghanistan for several years.\nBoth Mr. Gates and General Petraeus also have the job of easing concerns among military commanders about rigid withdrawal timetables. Mr. Gates has said in public that he opposed firm timelines, and during the administration\u2019s Afghanistan strategy review he insisted that any decisions about troop withdrawals be based on security conditions inside the country.\nAdministration officials on Sunday were also asked about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, the leader of the Qaeda network and the reason that the United States entered the war in Afghanistan in 2001.\nMr. Gates said it had been \u201cyears\u201d since the United States had had reliable intelligence about Mr. bin Laden, but he said it was still the assumption of American intelligence agencies that he was hiding in North Waziristan, in Pakistan. General Jones said that Mr. bin Laden was believed to cross the border into Afghanistan occasionally, but he gave no further details about American assessments of his location.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/world/asia/07afghan.html", "title": "No Firm Plans for a U.S. Exit in Afghanistan", "author": "MARK MAZZETTI"}

The town lies in a zone of central Somalia loosely controlled by a clan-based local government.\nThe pirates had been keeping the Chandlers, who were attacked Oct. 23 as they were sailing in their yacht in the Indian Ocean, in the captain\u2019s quarters of another vessel they had hijacked.\nRed Teeth declined to say why the hostages were being moved inland. \u201cThey\u2019re going to Baxdo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\nSome coastal residents said that as soon as Red Teeth\u2019s men left for Baxdo with the Chandlers, another squad of pirates in heavily armed pickup trucks chased after them, trying to recapture the hostages.\n\u201cThere have been constant meetings between the pirates, and they finally disagreed over the management of the couple,\u201d said Mahamoud, a resident of Xarardheere, a pirate stronghold along the shore.\nMahamoud, who did not want his last name published for fear of angering the pirates, said that European naval patrols had arrested friends and relatives of the pirates, including seven captured last week who were part of the same gang that originally hijacked the Chandlers\u2019 sailboat.\nOther pirate suspects are awaiting trial in France, while dozens have been handed over to Kenya and Yemen for prosecution. Some pirates suggested trading the couple, both in their 50s, for jailed comrades, residents said.\nOn Friday, a man claiming to represent the captors demanded a $7 million ransom for the couple.

{"date": "Fri, 10 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "A federal appeals court ruled Friday that a contractor found to have committed widespread fraud in Iraq could not avoid paying millions of dollars in damages by claiming that the United States law governing false claims essentially did not apply there, as a previous judge had found on technical grounds.\nThe decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., reverses a decision that had put a chill on what are believed to be dozens of pending whistle-blower cases involving contractors in Iraq. The earlier decision set aside a jury\u2019s verdict in 2006 that the contractor, Custer Battles, must pay about $10 million in damages and penalties to the United States government and two whistle-blowers.\nThe jury had found that under the False Claims Act, Custer Battles filed fake invoices and vastly inflated its costs, as two former employees of the company had charged. But the judge in the case, T. S. Ellis III of the Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., ultimately made two rulings that would have freed the company from paying any damages.\nFirst, even though the company eventually won security and logistics contracts in Iraq worth tens of millions of dollars, Judge Ellis ruled that in this case, only $3 million paid for with a Treasury check was subject to the False Claims Act. That ruling posed a severe limitation because in the months after the invasion, American officials used seized Iraqi cash and Iraqi oil revenues to pay many contractors.\nJudge Ellis said that fraud committed with Iraqi money was not subject to the act. He made a second ruling after the jury had already found the company liable for triple damages and other fees regarding the work paid for with the Treasury check. The judge found that American contracting officials abroad, like those with the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, could not strictly be regarded as agents of the United States government within the False Claims Act.\nThe latest judgment overturned those rulings, although the appeals court said that several other objections by the company would have to be considered by Judge Ellis before he decided whether the damages should be paid. The appeals court also gave the plaintiffs the option of a new trial.\nThe appeals court ruled in favor of Custer Battles in another decision by Judge Ellis relating specifically to a contract to provide security at Baghdad International Airport.\nThe appeals ruling, said Victor A. Kubli, a lawyer for the whistle-blowers, showed that the United States government\u2019s operations abroad were not \u201cfree-fraud zones\u201d for contractors.\nRobert T. Rhoad, a lawyer for Custer Battles, said he was pleased with the decision on the airport contract. As for the rest of the judgment, he said, \u201cWe simply see this as the Fourth Circuit clarifying this rapidly developing area of law and as a welcome opportunity to present our strongest arguments\u201d when the case goes back to the district court.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/world/middleeast/11custer.html", "title": "Contractor Must Pay in Iraq Fraud, Court Rules", "author": "JAMES GLANZ"}

They struck before dawn on Tuesday and were heavily armed, the government said in a statement, but the army, using boats and a helicopter, quickly repelled the attack.\nDiplomats and analysts say the evidence points to a nearer menace than last time: militants from the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Fighters from ethnic minorities in the oil-rich region have carried out insurgencies there for decades, demanding a greater share of the country\u2019s oil wealth. In recent years, they have gained steam, carrying out increasingly sophisticated attacks on oil installations far out at sea.\nThe men who carried out the attack had Nigerian currency and other items that pointed to a Nigerian connection, officials in Equatorial Guinea said. But Nigerian officials said Wednesday that it was too early to say for sure who was responsible.\n\u201cSo far, the investigations we have been able to make show that even the authorities in Equatorial Guinea are not yet very certain as to the identity of those who carried out the act,\u201d Ojo Maduekwe, Nigeria\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters in Abuja.\nBut officials in Equatorial Guinea said in a statement released Thursday that the men who had been arrested were members of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, the most powerful of the rebel groups operating in the region.\nIn a statement sent by e-mail to reporters, the spokesman for the group, who goes by the nom de guerre Jomo Gbomo, said the Nigerian government was behind the attack, calling it an attempt \u201cto install a dissident based in Spain as head of state.\u201d\nEquatorial Guinea is one of Africa\u2019s wealthiest but least stable nations. It is one of the continent\u2019s largest oil producers, yet it has a history of coup attempts and strife.\nIn 2004, a group of foreign mercenaries led by Simon Mann, a former British special forces officer, tried to sneak into the country with a cache of weapons to overthrow the government. The attempt was suspected of being at the behest of a rich investor who wanted an ally installed as president.\nMr. Mann, who helped found some of Africa\u2019s most notorious private, for-profit armies, was convicted last year in Malabo for his role in the plot and sentenced to 34 years in prison.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/world/africa/20africa.html", "title": "16 Held in Coup Effort in Equatorial Guinea", "author": "LYDIA POLGREEN"}

His visit also was reported in the New Light of Myanmar, the principal state-run newspaper.\nMr. Blake met with the foreign minister, Nyan Win, and other government officials, in the junta\u2019s new and remote capital of Naypyidaw. While American envoys of Mr. Blake\u2019s rank and position have visited Myanmar before, this was the first trip by a visiting American diplomat to Naypyidaw. In 2005, the ruling generals moved the government there from the principal city of Yangon.\nThe state newspaper called the meetings \u201ccordial discussions on issues of mutual interest and promotion of bilateral relations.\u201d\nMr. Blake did not meet with the reclusive leader of the junta, Senior General Than Shwe.\nA State Department spokesman, Gordon Duguid, said Wednesday that the visit did not signal \u201ca change in policy or approach to Burma,\u201d and he stressed that a review of United States policy is still underway.\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, frustrated over the junta\u2019s intransigence on human and political rights, ordered the policy review.\n\u201cClearly, the path we have taken in imposing sanctions hasn\u2019t influenced the Burmese junta,\u201d she said last month. \u201cReaching out and trying to engage them hasn\u2019t worked either.\u201d\nThe United States has a range of political and economic sanctions in place against Myanmar, and the State Department recently assailed the government in its annual human rights report, calling the junta \u201chighly authoritarian\u201d and accusing it of a broad series of abuses. (In something of a diplomatic slight, the State Department officially refers to Myanmar by its former pre-junta name, Burma; the department also uses Rangoon instead of Yangon.)\nMr. Blake also met this week with the leading opposition figures known as \u201cthe uncles,\u201d an Americanofficial in Yangon confirmed Thursday. He did not connect, however, with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the head of the opposition National League for Democracy. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, remains under house arrest at her home in Yangon; meetings between her and foreign diplomats are rare.\nEarlier this week, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s detention violated both international and Myanmar law. The group called for her immediate release.\nMr. Duguid said the United States is \u201ccommitted to encouraging a genuine dialogue between the Burmese authorities and opposition that leads to a free and democratic Burma.\u201d\nThe regime has pledged to hold \u201cmultiparty, democratic elections\u201d in 2010 as part of its \u201croad map to democracy.\u201d The last election, in 1990, was a landslide victory for the opposition. The junta, however, refused to recognize the result and has remained in power ever since.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/world/asia/27burma.html", "title": "U.S. Diplomat Makes a Trip to Myanmar", "author": "MARK McDONALD"}

{"date": "Tue, 30 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel defended his ultranationalist foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, on Tuesday after reports emerged that President Nicolas Sarkozy of France had urged that he be replaced with the leader of the centrist opposition, Tzipi Livni.\nMr. Sarkozy made the statement in a private meeting last week at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace attended by Mr. Netanyahu and a number of aides to both men, comparing Mr. Lieberman to Jean-Marie Le Pen, the far-right anti-immigrant French politician. Several participants at the meeting confirmed the reported statements.\nMr. Lieberman\u2019s spokesman said that Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s comment amounted to grave and insufferable meddling in the affairs of another democracy. Israeli radio broadcasts were filled with discussion of the episode, with right-wing members of Parliament assailing France and expressing indignation, while some on the left said that Mr. Sarkozy was correct.\nYossi Beilin, a former leftist member of Parliament and minister, said on Israel Radio that he had often heard from others what Mr. Sarkozy said: \u201cI can tell you a secret. I meet world leaders. There is hardly a conversation in which the subject does not come up. Someone will say, \u2018Tell me, what\u2019s this delusional appointment?\u2019 There\u2019s hardly a world leader who does not say this.\u201d\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s office issued a statement saying he had full confidence in his foreign minister, adding that Mr. Lieberman was \u201cfully committed to peace and security\u201d and was \u201can important member of the elected government of the democratic State of Israel.\u201d\nMr. Lieberman, head of the Yisrael Beiteinu Party and a West Bank settler, was elected on a platform that called for citizenship loyalty oaths at a time of growing discord between Israel\u2019s Jewish majority and Arab minority.\nWhen Mr. Lieberman visited France recently, Mr. Sarkozy declined to meet with him, although he routinely received Ms. Livni, who was foreign minister in the last government.\nAccording to the newspaper Yediot Aharonot, Mr. Sarkozy told Mr. Netanyahu that he should remake his government so that he, Ms. Livni and the defense minister, Ehud Barak, could produce historic breakthroughs for Middle East peace.\nHe was reported to have said, \u201cI\u2019ve always received Israeli foreign ministers. I met with Tzipi Livni in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, but with that one I simply can\u2019t meet. I\u2019m telling you, you need to get rid of that man. Get him out of the government and bring in Livni. With her and with Barak you can make history.\u201d\nThe paper said Mr. Netanyahu replied: \u201cNo need to exaggerate. Lieberman is a very nice person, and in private conversations he speaks differently.\u201d\nMr. Sarkozy was reported to have replied, \u201cIn private conversations, Jean-Marie Le Pen is also a nice person.\u201d\nMr. Sarkozy is said to have added of Mr. Lieberman, \u201cSometimes when I hear what he says I have the urge to pull out my hair.\u201d He placed his hands on his head and grabbed his hair.", "pageUrl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/world/middleeast/01mideast.html", "title": "Sarkozy Comments on Israeli Minister Make Waves", "author": "ETHAN BRONNER"}
